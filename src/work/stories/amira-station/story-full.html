    Okay folks, here we go again. You know the drill by now; vote as many times as you want for whichever prompt you want to be written into a full story. The length tags are all guesses, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve figured out by now that these often go longer than I think they will. The three prompts that aren&#39;t picked here might come back later, might be rewritten, or might be dropped entirely. Who knows! Anyway, I don&#39;t have much else to say here so without further ado, your options:
    
    <img loading="lazy" class="chatlog__emoji " alt="☢" title="☢" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/latest/svg/2622.svg">️  <strong>[NOVEL?] All Falling Apart</strong>
    <em>Adventure / Existential horror</em>
    <em>Near-future - a planet like the Earth (Kronwa&#235;)</em>
    [Part of the Kronwa&#235; canon, but not significantly related to the main timeline.]
    Everything has gotten worse lately. Resource shortages, global political turmoil, climate disasters, and now it seems like portions of the planet itself are simply sinking into the ground. It’s all falling apart, and no one knows what to do to fix it, or if we even can. Our protagonist must decide how to proceed in this seemingly-doomed world, whether that means struggling to save it, desperately trying to escape, or something else entirely. One thing’s for sure: there isn’t long left.

    <em>Fantasy / Adventure</em>
    <em>Magical Medieval / Renaissance</em>
    [Part of the Debhaust canon.]
    There have long been tales of the lands to the far north; the frozen plateau of Leng is sparsely populated and mostly unexplored, so it breeds legends and mysteries at a rapid pace. One such legend tells of a series of obsidian pillars wrought by demigods of an age long passed that lie at the very limit of the world - some say atop the tallest mountain while others swear they stand in the frozen sea. All stories agree that these pillars hold frigid astral power and are linked to the swirling constellations above. So, when a new star appears in the sky and the world starts to go mad, those rare few who both believe the legends and have the resolve to travel north begin to cast their gaze towards the icy plateau and its long-buried secrets...

    <em>Mystery / Horror</em>
    <em>The future - industrial station - Kronwa&#235;</em>
    [Part of the Kronwa&#235; canon, but not significantly related to the main timeline.]
    Our protagonist has lived their whole life within the seemingly-infinite confines of Amira Station, setting out each day to fix the problems provided on their computer display every morning. Recently, however, things have been going wrong. Problems crop up with increasing frequency and severity, tools and replacement parts often arrive broken or not at all, and food and other living supplies are becoming scarce as well. The station is falling apart, and it&#39;s high time to get out before the whole thing comes crashing down. If there even <em>is</em> an outside. There have to be other humans around, somewhere, but they&#39;ve never seen one. Maybe there&#39;s someone or something in the station with answers and a way out. Or maybe they&#39;ll have to figure it out themselves.

    <em>Science Fiction / Investigation</em>
    <em>The Future - Space/Kronwa&#235;</em>
    [Part of the Kronwa&#235; main timeline.]
    Months have passed since the events of Eir Terminus. Galaxy-wide weapons corporation Lockheed-Bolte is intensely interested in the crystal hearts and its top scientist on the project is hot on the trail of the mythical and unknown Yhvra. Seemingly random planets hold secrets older than the known universe. Ellie and Mel, to their embarrassment, are occasionally running jobs for the scientist while Qaniit tracks down his own planet’s connection to ancient starships and the hearts. Clues have been appearing for a while, but with the latest breakthrough, it becomes clear that there’s a deeper pattern to all of this than was originally apparent. It’s time to uncover the truth, once and for all.

    <em>Amira Station</em> it is, then. Let’s start by determining some truths about the characters. To start with, the story will be written in third person because there are multiple viewpoints. The main character, Euvi, is predefined since there are only so many archetypes for a person who has lived alone in an industrial station their whole life. However, we can make some choices about the other two potential protagonists.
    
    Who is the protagonist employed to control the station?
    <img loading="lazy" class="chatlog__emoji " alt="📺" title="tv" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/latest/svg/1f4fa.svg"> - Wayde Lenanon, monitoring technician and often broadly ignored by his superiors.

    <img loading="lazy" class="chatlog__emoji " alt="🪑" title="chair" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/latest/svg/1fa91.svg"> - No one. [There will still be people in charge of the station, but there will be no scenes from their perspective.]
    
    Who is the protagonist traveling to the station, and why are they doing so?
    <img loading="lazy" class="chatlog__emoji " alt="🚨" title="rotating_light" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/latest/svg/1f6a8.svg"> - Ifan X’deven, a Galactic Federation official investigating reports of wrongdoing at the station.

    Okay, so we’ll have Claril and Ifan be the remaining two protagonists. We just need to learn a little more about each of our three camera-followed characters before we can get started.
    
    How long has Claril Hvet been working for Amira Station? This will also, to some degree, affect her age and likely her attitude towards events at the station.
    <img loading="lazy" class="chatlog__emoji " alt="🤏" title="pinching_hand" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/latest/svg/1f90f.svg"> - Not very long at all. Less than a year.
    ⏲️ - A fair amount of time. Several years.
    ⌛ - Quite a while. More than a decade.
    
    What species is Ifan X’deven? The man himself will not be a caricature of his species, but these are some traits each is generally known for.
    <img loading="lazy" class="chatlog__emoji " alt="🤷" title="person_shrugging" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/latest/svg/1f937.svg"> - Human. Mostly-hairless apes with high adaptability; tend to anthropomorphize everything. You know humans.
    <img loading="lazy" class="chatlog__emoji " alt="🪸" title="🪸" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/latest/svg/1fab8.svg"> - Umian. Green or blue-skinned with gel-like hair strands, umians are typically creative and interested in art.
    <img loading="lazy" class="chatlog__emoji " alt="🦎" title="lizard" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/latest/svg/1f98e.svg"> - Gauruvian. Rust-colored reptilians with good physical abilities, though often prone to irritability.
    <img loading="lazy" class="chatlog__emoji " alt="🐟" title="fish" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/latest/svg/1f41f.svg"> - Vaeshar. Amphibious with a dual respiratory system, often industrious and good at working in a team.
    
    When was the last time Euvi spoke aloud?
    <img loading="lazy" class="chatlog__emoji " alt="🗣" title="🗣" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/latest/svg/1f5e3.svg">️ - Yesterday night. She practices just in case she ever meets someone else.
    <img loading="lazy" class="chatlog__emoji " alt="🤐" title="zipper_mouth" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/latest/svg/1f910.svg"> - Weeks to months ago. She can speak, but definitely doesn’t do so very often.

    Euvi woke up to the familiar three-tone chime, as she did every day. She mumbled to herself and rolled over in bed, keeping her eyes closed as the lights clicked on and slowly warmed up to their normal brightness. There were a few moments of relative silence - consisting of only the constant rumble of fans and distant machinery that never ceased, even in this insulated compartment. Then, a warning chime lower in pitch than the three that had woken her, a few seconds’ pause, and a loud hiss of air followed by a <em>thunk.</em> Finally, a series of softer but higher pitched beeps rounded out the morning’s orchestration. Four, today. Not bad.
    
    She yawned and allowed the movement to drag her eyes open, slowly adjusting to the brightness and shuffling here and there under the covers. It was so tempting to just roll over and go back to sleep; nothing would stop her! She could lay in bed all day if she wanted to. It’s just that there wouldn’t be any credits - or food - the next morning if she did that.
    
    Eventually, Euvi managed to overcome the simple inertia of the bed and emerged from her nest of pillows. She caught one stitched to resemble a cat’s face before it could fall to the floor and carefully returned it to the pile, using the momentum of the catch to roll herself out of bed and onto the warm rug. The rug was her own work, as were most of the pillows and even some of the blankets. You needed a hobby to wind down after a tough day on the job, and Euvi had several. Sewing was a good one, since it let her make things that she couldn’t otherwise have. Like the cat pillow. She gave it a pat before padding away from the bed, bare feet now falling on smooth, warm metal instead of soft, warm fabric.

A keyboard and mouse lay beneath it on a small desk.
    
    She tapped at the keyboard, causing a mess of lines and polygons in varying colors to flash into existence. A few bright dots pulsed amid the spaghetti-like mess, from which she selected one and clicked it. Information spilled onto the screen, describing the character and severity of the incident it represented. Euvi nodded absently as she picked up her battered tablet from the desk and keyed in a brief sequence to transfer the data. Then it was on to the next dot, and the next. Once all four had been reviewed, she set the tablet down again and considered what to wear.
    
    There hadn’t been anything very dangerous on today’s list - leak in a fresh water pipe, worn drive belt, and two damaged diagnostic sensors. That meant lightweight clothes to better combat the oppressive heat that constantly suffused the station. Even here, in her insulated and air conditioned living compartment, the ambient temperature was still well above seventy degrees. Though that was less a limitation on the AC’s ability and more that the thermostat didn’t allow her to turn the temperature down any further. Regardless, she picked out a tank top and some short leggings for today’s attire, also setting her standard kit by the hatch for later use.
    
    Then, she returned to the wall just to the left of the terminal and slid up the hatch to reveal a large, bullet-shaped casing about the size of her torso. Euvi grabbed the case and unpacked it onto the table before sliding it back into the tube and nudging the return button. With a rattling hiss, the empty case shot back into the station’s pneumatic network and Euvi could sit down to her delivered breakfast.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1042979146176925706 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1042979146176925706><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="17-Nov-22 08:46 PM">20:46</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She scrolled through the day’s tasks again as she chewed through the containers of synthetic eggs, bacon, and hash browns - a somewhat rare treat only awarded for high performance. She had done well yesterday and even got a sugar donut to round out the meal. This she decided to save for later, given how much walking she’d need to do to get to all the tasks on time. Back into the container for now.
    
    Finally, after another stop by the bathroom to brush her teeth again (Euvi hated walking for hours with any remnants of breakfast hiding in her mouth), she grabbed her kit and unlocked the exit hatch. The trapdoor slid up on smoothly greased rods and she climbed down the ladder into the station proper.
    
    Sometimes she wondered why the hatch had a lock. It wasn’t like she had ever met anyone or anything else capable of opening it even when unlocked.
    
    As usual, the corridor she now stood in was unfamiliar. Euvi hadn’t ever been able to conclusively determine if the station’s hallways rearranged themselves or if her living compartment moved around - or both - but she rarely woke up to the same location more than a few days in a row. Still, it wasn’t like it mattered; her tablet held the station’s map out to about twenty five miles in any direction from her compartment. More than enough to navigate by.
    
    The closest task wasn’t too far away, so Euvi decided to head there first. She hummed aimlessly to herself as she walked, occasionally speaking a few quiet words aloud under the background hum. “It is hot,” she enunciated clearly as she passed a clattering noise and sudden temperature spike. “I should turn right,” she murmured at an intersection. “Hello,” she addressed a charred stain on the wall. “Happy to meet you. I am - my name is Euvi.” A nod as she continued on. She often practiced speaking on her treks, just in case she ever met another living person. She hadn’t yet, but she wanted to be ready if it ever happened.

She knew there had to be other people around here somewhere - she occasionally encountered abandoned tools, scratched symbols or messages in the walls, and in some somber cases even bones lying in sticky, bluish liquid. She had just never managed to meet the users of the tools, the writers of the messages, or the unfortunate former owners of the bones. The tasks were probably designed to keep her away from everyone else, or maybe she was the last one left. There wasn’t really a way to tell, and pondering it led her thoughts dangerously close to the one topic that she tried her best to avoid.
    
    Namely, what was it like outside of the station? Was there an outside at all? Could she get there?
    
    Euvi shook her head. “Not that. The task is ahead.”
    
    The humidity began to rise precipitously as she approached the site of the broken water pipe. It wasn’t still leaking - the station had sealed the valves on its own - but enough water had spilled recently enough that it almost felt like she was pushing her way through a warm, damp towel as she set down her bag and inspected the issue.
    
    The pipe had split apart at a seam; several of the bolts holding the flange in place had seemingly sheared right through and one section sagged from the ceiling, partially disconnected from the other. “This is more than a leak,” Euvi murmured, poking the dangling assembly and watching it spill a few more droplets of water onto the floor. “But that is okay. That’s? I will fix you. I’ll fix you.” She debated between the contraction and expanded form before settling on the contraction, repeating it again. Euvi often spoke to the things she repaired. It made her feel less lonely.

    <em>Scene 1</em>
    She tugged on a pair of gloves for some protection against any protruding metal, then got to work. Knocked out the remaining broken bolts, disconnected the flange entirely, and removed the inner gasket as well. One part of it had torn near the top, possibly as a result of high-pressure water during the initial break. Euvi hummed and murmured nonsensical words to go along with the tune, entering the part identifiers and quantities she’d need for the replacement into her tablet.
    
    After double-checking the bundle, she tapped the request and stood up again. The nearest drop point was very close by, so she wandered over at a sedate pace to give the capsule time to arrive. Vaguely, she wondered if there were other people who packed the replacement parts into the capsules or if the station did that on its own. Her humming grew distracted as she considered this, then returned to normal as the thought escaped her without reaching a conclusion. Just as it always did.
    
    Euvi arrived before the parts did, even walking slowly, so she sat down against the smooth metal wall and looked around for anything interesting to check out. Nothing really caught her eye; the drop point itself was a large metal cover in the wall like a larger version of the one in her living compartment. There were no scratched messages or other major debris around that could indicate the presence of others like her. The rest of the area was relatively boring as well: just a small, roughly square room containing nothing of interest beyond the drop point and a door that she knew would lead to a bathroom. They all looked like this. The only difference between this drop point and one she had visited two months ago was the color of the faded paint that still clung in narrow lines to the walls. Dark orange, here. She still didn’t know what the color signified.

Euvi got up and retrieved the case, unpacking it on the extended shelf just below the... huh?
    
    She frowned, holding up the replacement gasket. It was clearly damaged, with a fine network of cracks running through the rubber and a few chunks actually missing. This thing wouldn’t hold the pipe together.
    
    And the bolts weren’t much better either. A number of them were stripped or malformed, and one was even missing the head entirely. Euvi didn’t even bother inspecting the flanges after that and just threw the whole mess back into the tube, keying in the “defective” code to return the entire batch. With another whoosh, it vanished back into the network and the drop point quickly registered another incoming capsule - her replacement replacement parts.
    
    Euvi hummed absently and drummed her fingers on the shelf. It wasn’t unheard of to get defective parts - that’s why the code existed, after all - but it was definitely rare to get so many bad parts at once. And it <em>was</em> unheard of to get multiple bad batches several days in a row. Over the past week, she had gotten four bad shipments that had to be sent back. Was something wrong? Could she do anything about it if something was? No, not really. So it wasn’t worth worrying about.
    
    She worried about it anyway, though in a distant, out-of-the-way corner of her mind. Just something nagging away at the edge of her consciousness, a vague reminder that something wasn’t quite right. Maybe she’d be called upon to fix something with the pneumatic system at some point. The drop points themselves weren’t immune to problems, though it was very annoying to try and fix one. She’d have to go all the way to another drop point to get the parts for it, a trek that was usually at least half a mile lugging heavy mechanical components the whole way.

Euvi inspected them again, didn’t see anything glaringly out of place this time, and headed back to the pipe to install the new connector. Minutes passed as she clicked the flanges and gasket into place, then tightened each bolt to hold the pipe together. She stepped back to survey her work, satisfied, and marked the task complete on her tablet. Clangs sounded in the ceiling as the station reopened the flow valves, and the pipe rattled as water rushed through it again. Euvi kept a close eye on the joint for a few minutes, then nodded to herself upon seeing no leaks. “All better,” she told it. “Stay whole.”
    
    The day’s remaining tasks passed in much the same way as the first one. Euvi replaced a snapped drive belt and two sensors that seemed to have failed from excessive heat. One more capsule needed to be sent back as defective. Nothing else of note happened, because nothing else of note <em>ever</em> happened. Even though the station was unimaginably huge and kept changing around her every few days, the standardized metal corridors, grates, mechanical rooms, and so on were always the same. Never any hint as to what the manifold mechanisms she maintained actually did, or what the point of all this was.
    
    Her humming grew louder as she cast aside those thoughts, returning to a more neutral banality. It was okay. She didn’t need anything else. She had food to eat, a job to do, and hobbies to pursue. This was enough. Reaching for anything more was just greedy.
    
    Euvi returned to her living compartment and had the sugar donut saved from breakfast with her third meal. Then, she still had a few hours left before bed. Hours with which the station had no plans for her. Freedom. But what to do with it today?

    <em>Scene 2</em>
    She tapped at the terminal, which was now unlocked since she had completed the day’s tasks. Unlike before, where it would only show the map and task details, it now allowed her to spend credits on various items - that’s how she got the fabric for her projects - or browse the net. Today, she clicked back to an article she had been reading yesterday about large, chunky, friendly looking animals who apparently inhabited cold places where the ground was made of ice and there was so much water you could swim in it.
    
    She tried to imagine the sensation of moving through water on her own; no solid land beneath. It must feel like flying. Either way, as fascinating as these creatures were, today she was only looking for some good pictures to base a pattern on. She wanted to add another cute pillow to her collection and these dorky-looking animals would make an exceptionally fluffy one.
    
    Euvi scrolled through the image results, eventually picking out a promising picture where the subject almost seemed to be smiling, and got to work sketching out her plan. Always paid off to be organized before getting to work. She only had so much fabric to screw up.
    
    The worries of the day began to retreat as she sketched, comparing the proportions of her drawing to those of the picture and exaggerating some features for extra cuteness or to make the seams easier to handle. The station hummed around her: a billion different machines all performing their predetermined tasks. This was good. This was normal.
    
    Everything was okay and everything would be okay.
    
    ...
    
    “This,” Claril Hvet declared, “is not normal.”

Heavy footsteps thudded on thin carpet as her assistant approached. Quildroth Narszeth was a gauruvian scientist, a rarity among his species. Most male guaruvians raised in traditional environments were pressed into military service - or at minimum police work, bodyguarding, bounty hunting, or some other profession involving a good deal of violence. Narszeth was reluctant to speak of his background, but Claril had at least pried enough out of him to know that he was no longer welcome at home due to his career. Which was a real shame, as the young man was dedicated and had a strong aptitude for astronomy. Quietly, Claril wondered how many brilliant young gauruvian minds like Narszeth were squandered by the heavy traditions of the long-militarized species.
    
    “Dr Hvet?” He loomed over her, nearly seven feet tall with skin coated in tough, bronze-colored scales. She had been distracted.
    
    “Right. Take a look out the window, here.” Narszeth dutifully followed her pointing finger, which indicated a portion of the brilliant red star that took up almost the entire viewport. The reinforced glass was heavily tinted to allow them to look upon the sun safely.
    
    “What am I looking for? And should I be using the scope?”
    
    “No need; this is very obvious once you spot it. Down a little from the yellow spot in the lower right... just above the-” She saw his expression change. “Got it?”
    
    “Got it.” His jaw worked as he pressed close to the glass to get a closer look. “How did it get through the stasis field?”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1044320290827673691 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1044320290827673691><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="21-Nov-22 01:35 PM">13:35</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“That is a very good question.” Claril turned away from the window and hurried over to the monitoring station built into one of the room’s desks. The observatory was lit entirely by the sun itself, either directly through the window or indirectly via a series of solar-powered lights hooked up to panels on the sunward side of the station. That meant that it should never be dark, and yet... “Blast it; remind me to put in an order for another replacement bulb later. Third one this week.”
    
    Narszeth nodded, still looking out the window at the roiling mass of red-orange plasma that had somehow managed to eject itself from the sun even through the lattice-like stasis field woven around the entire star. He could still make out the field’s blue-white lines of energy with the aid of a scope, but they almost seemed fuzzy near the eruption site. “Dr Hvet? Can you tell if there’s currently a breach in the stasis field?”
    
    She held up a finger, scrolling around the 3D model of the star in the computer. “No, there isn’t. At least...”
    
    “Well, I’m looking at it right now, and I’d say there probably is.” A jet of plasma the width of a continent flared away from the sun, passing fully out of the field’s influence and boiling away into space. “I hope that’s not going to hit anything,” he muttered.
    
    “Ah, hell.” Claril clicked several times, zooming into the area that had just erupted. “Field strength sensors in that grid section last updated yesterday. Another instrument failure that meant we didn’t see it in time. It’ll probably repair itself whenever someone gets around to replacing those sensors. I really can’t imagine why it’s taking so long to repair; field sensors should be the highest priority...” Claril trailed off as she tracked the eruption’s trajectory.
    
    Narszeth wandered over, expression grim. “Seems like maintenance has been hitting more delays recently. Do you think there’s anything we can... Is that the thing’s trajectory?”
    
    Claril nodded.

    <em>Scene 3</em>
    “Narszeth, go to the next office over and use their phone; get someone in maintenance on the line and direct them to the grid section manually! I’m calling the director.”
    
    The gauruvian nodded and rushed into the corridor. Claril kept glancing between the monitor and the star - Sibdael itself - as it shed more and more charged gas through the hole in the field and the projection grew worse. Finally, her call went to voicemail.
    
    “Piece of-” Claril interrupted herself with a sharp breath. No time to waste; if the director didn’t pick up, she’d just take matters into her own hands. Namely, contacting the planetary government herself. It technically broke the chain of command, but in an event like this, saving lives was the priority and every minute she waited meant thousands more dead. She shivered, feeling a cold sweat even in the climate-controlled confines of the station. The <em>entire reason</em> this installation existed was to stop events exactly like that. How could they have failed so badly? What had gone wrong, and how many would die because of it?
    
    “Sibdael II planetary administration; how can I help you today?”
    
    “It’s more like how I can help you,” Claril led with a shudder. “I’m a scientist on Amira Station and I have very urgent news...”
    
    ...
    
    Ifan X’deven, investigative officer of the Galactic Federation, waited patiently as he wandered slowly through the hallway, taking his time to examine each massive counter-relief sculpture. Such carvings were relatively uncommon among most civilized worlds; most cultures seemed to prefer high- or bas-relief for this type of work. To carve artwork into the stone, wood, or plastic substrate - rather than raise it out of the background - indicated a particular relationship between the artist and the material.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1045014802327687258 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1045014802327687258><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="23-Nov-22 11:35 AM">11:35</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Or it could indicate that the mineral composition on this planet allowed for the creation of precise cutting tools before strong bonding agents, so it may have simply been easier to carve away than add to.
    
    Ifan was standing in the Planetary Administration Complex of Sibdael II, awaiting his appointment to meet with the Administrator. His ultimate destination was Amira Station to investigate for potential SBRVs - the near-unpronounceable acronym stood for sentient being rights violations - but he had stopped by several of the Sibdael system’s planets first to get a better understanding of the station’s relationship to the people it served.
    
    Given his recently-acquired knowledge of Amira Station and the Sibdael system generally, Ifan knew he would have a hard time actually proving anything, much less applying enough pressure to effect meaningful change. Sibdael was near the edge of the mid-spiral, meaning it was also near the edge of the area of space where the Federation’s law actually meant anything. The governments out here still broadly obeyed core Federation tenets - such as those prohibiting the very types of crime he was here to stop - but his authority didn’t go nearly as far here as back in the core. At least it wasn’t an outer-spiral system, where there was a very real danger of being attacked on sight by the wanted criminals or fiercely independent types who made that region of space their home.
    
    He stared up at a sculpture carved from a solid chunk of translucent red crystal several meters wide. The artist had varied the material’s depth expertly to suggest subtle variations of luminance across the surface of the massive star the piece depicted. Ifan could also make out the unconventional addition of Amira Station itself near the lower-right of the sculpture, formed of a smooth grey stone and standing in complete contrast to the rest of the piece.

Amira Station had been constructed several hundred years ago by a coalition of system governments in the local sector for one initial purpose: to prevent the star Sibdael from detonating in a supernova that would wipe out life for dozens of light years in every direction. Ostensibly, the megaproject was intended to be temporary; just lasting long enough to allow all system governments to make preparations to either weather the storm or move their population elsewhere.
    
    But here it remained, nearly four hundred years later, the star still frozen in the start of its death throes and the Sibdael system still fully populated without the means to survive the detonation of its parent star. So far, none of the planetary governors had managed to give Ifan a sensible answer as to why that was. He was hoping the Administrator of Sibdael II, also the seat of the system government, would have more information than the rest <em>and</em> would be willing to share it.
    
    A clerk hurried towards him and Ifan stopped, smiling banally to suggest that his patience was wearing thin. He had been here for over an hour already. “Is my appointment finally ready?” he asked, his voice still carrying a lilting musicality even through the universal translator installed in his head. An accent that declared his umian heritage and upbringing on his species’ original home planet, if you knew what to listen for.
    
    The clerk - also an umian, coincidentally - stumbled, hair strands inflating as they tried to suck in additional air. The man had run here. “I’m afraid not, Officer. The Administrator regrets to inform you that a critical matter of planetary security has come up, and he must cancel your appointment.”
    
    Ifan frowned. “Did he suggest when he might be able to reschedule? I represent the Galactic Federation and I am investigating <em>system</em> wide crimes.”

This matter is so urgent that he suggests you leave the planet and return in several months, when he may have more time to address your concerns.”
    
    Ifan felt his hair strands tensing in annoyance - an umian racial tell that only another umian could pick out. He kept the strands tucked beneath a hairband while on duty, to avoid them giving anything away. “Several months is completely unacceptable. What is this ‘critical matter’ that has so completely absorbed the Administrator’s attention? Should the Federation be involved?”
    
    The clerk nervously took a step backwards. “I’m afraid I know little of the specifics, but the Administrator was quite insistent that you leave the planet - at least temporarily - before meeting again. I’m sorry, but there’s nothing else I can do for you.”
    
    Highly suspicious. Ifan quietly doubted there even <em>was</em> a “critical matter,” and suspected this was just a delaying tactic. Still, he didn’t have the practical authority out here to just barge in, even if he might be able to get technical clearance from the core.

    <em>Scene 4</em>
    “Fine,” Ifan eventually responded, making his annoyance obvious. “Inform the Administrator that he must provide further details on this emergency to myself or another Federation official within two days.”
    
    The clerk nodded, relieved. “Very good, sir. Will you need any further assistance?”
    
    “No.” Ifan omitted the customary thanks from the dismissal, still trying to play the part of a frustrated but defeated agent. “I know the way back to the port.”
    
    The clerk nodded again and scampered away, back towards the secured zone at the rear of the building. Ifan waited a few minutes, busying himself by sending an intermediate report back to HQ, then walked confidently in the same direction as the clerk. Away from the spaceport, but of course he had no intention of leaving just yet.
    
    The interior of the Planetary Administration Center was surprisingly lavish, given that the outside wasn’t much more than a squat, bunker-like cube with a few spires. Inside, the Sibdael system had lined many spacious halls with famous works of art as well as fine decor in the traditionally colorful style of the system’s major planets. Sleek carpets in warm reds or oranges blended with the stone - or more likely some sort of laminate approximation in this modern age - floors and walls. The whole effect was like walking through a burgeoning coral reef, or perhaps a wildfire.
    
    The finery on display contrasted with the offices of the Galactic Federation back in the coreworlds. Ifan was used to administrative centers like those on Strillia or Gamma Veox: bland, utilitarian buildings designed with exacting precision to match that of the bureaucracy that operated out of them.
    
    Still, he couldn’t judge the efficacy of the Sibdael government by their offices alone. He was here to <em>investigate</em>, not immediately jump to conclusions. That meant playing it by the book, at least to start with. Well, mostly by the book. By his “slightly edited” copy of the book.

    “Is that so? Even an officer of the Federation with a valid writ of investigation?” He produced the document, sent only a few minutes ago by a magistrate back at HQ as an update to his existing warrant.
    
    The guard accepted the official-looking hologram projected from a slim metal disc and studied it for several moments. Ifan waited patiently, arms folded. It sure was easier to be confident when his documents actually <em>were</em> legitimate, as opposed to the years before he had joined the Federation. This writ of investigation gave him full federal authority to physically inspect any location in the system, with the only restriction being for the safety of himself or those around him. A powerful and very broad instrument; one that many thought was <em>too</em> broad. But with the main body of the Federation thousands of light years away, it wasn’t like the magistrate could be much more specific without taking Ifan’s word for what he needed to inspect anyway.
    
    “E-excuse me for one moment.” The guard retreated to his post, tapping at a pad on the wall and speaking quietly into the receiver.
    
    Ifan smiled and quietly flexed his ears in a particular way. His implanted exocortex quickly responded to the command and his hearing immediately became several times more acute, allowing him to overhear both sides of the guard’s conversation. As well as many other less relevant sounds, but the exocortex and his training combined to filter out much of the background noise.
    
    “-care what kind of writ he has, keep him out of here for the next hour!” the person on the phone exclaimed. The quality was too low for him to make out any significant details of the person’s voice.
    
    “But I can’t just deny entry to a Federation officer with this kind of authorization, right?”

    “I... okay. Understood, ma’am.”
    
    Ifan let his hearing return to normal as the guard hung up and approached with a sheepish look on his face.
    
    “Well?” Ifan asked, accepting the disc back. “You are to allow me passage, correct?”
    
    “I... uh, I’m sorry to inform you that there has been a... fuel leak in the office section, and even your writ does not allow entry into a hazardous situation. If you’ll be willing to wait a few hours, I’m sure everything will be cleaned up and you can go in.”
    
    Ifan stared at the man. “Are you aware that lying to a Federation officer is a criminal offense?”
    
    A flinch. “... Yes? Why do you bring this up?”

    <em>Scene 5</em>
    “‘Make something up,’” Ifan quoted. “‘Those writs have exceptions for safety, right?’ Need I go on?”
    
    The guard stuttered but failed to produce any intelligible speech.
    
    “I’ll take that as a ‘no.’ Anyway, what do you say that we both just forget what we heard on that call? I get to proceed and you get to do your <em>actual</em> job, which includes allowing entrance to individuals with valid clearance.”
    
    “...”
    
    A minute later, Ifan strode hurriedly into the office section. He would bet the guard had already reported his entrance, which meant the person on the other end of that call would likely be speeding up their timetable to try and... do something before he arrived. If they could, at least. It was entirely possible he’d have the whole hour and didn’t need to rush, but he generally preferred to hurry unnecessarily than to move slowly and miss his target. When he had to, at least.
    
    Luckily, his quick pace wasn’t out of the norm at the moment. Clerks rushed to and fro, and even those at workstations moved at a feverish pace. There was an air of frantic anxiety over the entire place, and Ifan needed to know why. He slowed, covertly inspecting some of the monitors.
    
    Bulletins and messages, sent to major power and telecommunications providers. Heads of local governments on the phone shouting at staffers here. Documents passed in disorderly flows, giving him ample time to scan the headers: “Disaster Management Plan, Planetary” was a common theme. A group of engineers in neutral colors argued before a large console, disagreeing about power drain and the correct parameters to operate with. He paused a little longer by this last group, eventually moving on once he heard one of them mention what they were operating: the city-wide shield dome over the capital.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1046465410880503908 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1046465410880503908><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="27-Nov-22 11:39 AM">11:39</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Sibdael II didn’t have a full-on planetary shield - only extremely populated and wealthy metropolis planets could afford the brutal cost in materials and manpower to maintain one - but several of its most important metro areas did have local shields. These were relatively common on coreworlds and relatively uncommon in the mid-spiral, but definitely not unheard of. The massive dome-like generators took up multiple city blocks and required entire dedicated power plants to operate, but in times of space-based crisis, nothing was better for a city than a giant field of energy between it and whatever was threatening it. Since ground-based generators had access to an entire city’s energy supply at minimum - and a whole planet’s at maximum - it was incredibly difficult for conventional assaults to break one.
    
    But of course, the Sibdael system wasn’t at war. Ifan started to get an idea of what was going on here, and he pushed through the sea of frantic clerks to confirm it. The higher-ups, including the Administrator himself, would be on the upper levels of the very rear of the building, just beneath one of the spires. The chaos - and the total absence of anyone higher ranked than occasional low-level managers - combined with the call from the guard to form a picture that Ifan definitely didn’t like.
    
    He started to run. Half the people around him already were, so he didn’t stand out. A few individuals noticed his badge or weapon and gasped, but the majority of the crowd was so focused on their own tasks that he wasn’t overly conspicuous.

The mayhem seemed to be getting worse - either by time or by location - and he scowled darkly as he continued to observe no one above panicked floor-level managers trying to bring any sense of order to the proceedings.
    
    The elevator slowed to a stop on the top level of its run and Ifan jumped out, shoving through the crowd towards the closed conference rooms that the higher level administrators, including <em>the</em> Administrator, would theoretically be using to manage the now-obviously-real crisis.
    
    Unlocked; empty.
    
    He tried the next, and the next, and the next. All dark and abandoned, though recently. Chairs had been tipped over; pens and personal effects left behind. The Administrator’s office was just down the hall, past a set of two guards shouting as they tried to direct frantic staff away from the doors. They failed as he watched, bodily shoved away from the entrance as the crowd surged through. A cry went up.
    
    Empty.
    
    Ifan stepped into the nearest conference room, sliding the door nearly shut so he could get away from the noise and make a plan. Given the severity of the response - activating a city-wide shield would cost billions of credits and was only worthwhile for the worst disasters - he suspected something had gone wrong with Amira Station and this planet was about to be hit by some terrible expulsion from the sun. Given the complete lack of leadership in the building, he suspected the Administrator and most of the planet’s top staff had fled - either to space or deep below ground - leaving the task of preparing for the storm to their disorganized, terrified ground-level staff.

    <em>Scene 6</em>
    “Alright, let’s do this.” Ifan took in a deep, unnecessary breath through his mouth - umians breathed through their hair strands - and let it out again. An expression he had picked up from some human friends a while back. Time to get to work.
    
    He stepped back out into the chaos and spent a few moments looking for an intercom desk. Finding it, he gently shoved the current operator aside - they didn’t seem to be doing anything with it anyway - and tapped it a few times to get everyone’s attention. Dull thumps echoed through the building from speakers on every floor. The general noise level dropped and most of the staff turned in his direction, tense.
    
    “My name is Ifan X’deven, officer of the Galactic Federation,” he began. “As you should all know, this planet is currently in grave danger and your Administrator seems to have gone missing. As such, I and others from the Federation will be leading you instead. We have a very short time to save as many lives as possible, and every individual in this building has a critical part to play. Anyone whose direct manager has gone missing now reports to me, on the seventh floor. Keep your composure and we will save this planet.”
    
    He paused for a moment, gauging the reactions of those around him. “In case I wasn’t clear, that meant <em>move.</em> We have a planet to save, people.”
    
    Activity returned in an immediate burst as many of the staff who had shoved their way into the Administrator’s empty office mobbed Ifan instead, all shouting over each other and trying to deliver various reports or questions. He clearly couldn’t manage everyone on his own, but luckily he had help.

After a necessarily brief explanation, she brought on a number of other staff, all virtually present on various monitors and desks spread among the floors. He handed off most of the Sibdael staff over to them, stepping back after nearly 50 minutes of constant talking and decision-making to finally get a moment to breathe.
    
    No one had been able to track down the director of Amira Station, but several scientists and mid-level managers had gotten on a conference call to explain what was going on and what to expect. Ifan stayed back from that conversation, letting those with the actual experience to make the decisions handle it, but he still paid attention to the predicted effects.
    
    Under the shields, the most they’d get would be a pretty light show as long as the power plants held up. Thankfully, one of the engineers arguing downstairs had managed to locate an inventory of fuel supplies for the generators and confirmed they would be good to go for at least a week. They only had to last an hour or less before the beam from the sun passed out of their orbital path.

Anything electrical without extensive hardening or shielding would fry or explode, setting technology across most of the planet back to pre-industrial levels. Much of the atmosphere’s natural defense against solar radiation would be used up in one massive burst, leaving the population vulnerable to all sorts of ionizing rays. The planet’s magnetic field would be violently compressed, leading to further issues with communications even under the shields. And in the center of the beam, it was possible enough heat could make it down to the surface to start fires or burn people alive. A swath hundreds of miles wide would be scorched through the midst of the continent, though at least those on the other side of the planet would be safe from that particular horror.
    
    Amira Station had made one tiny mistake - failing to replace damaged field strength sensors in time - and the fallout would cost millions of people their lives. Thankfully, the stasis field had by now been manually readjusted to close the gap, so none of the system’s other planets were in danger. But with billions of people to protect and less than an hour to do it, things were looking grim indeed. Federation ships were already mobilizing to assist the survivors, but the massive carriers needed for the operation were stationed near the galactic core; it would take them <em>weeks</em> to arrive. Smaller, faster, or closer ships could arrive more quickly, but would have a correspondingly lesser ability to help. No, the real best bet for aid would be from the other Sibdael planets and the other systems in the local sector.

Talks were still ongoing, and without the majority of the planet’s executive officials, they were moving slowly.
    
    A little over half an hour remained before the beam would strike. Hobbyist observatories had begun to notice and panic spread throughout the global population. Someone had to speak; to explain what was going to happen and what their leaders were doing to help.

    <em>Scene 7</em>
    That someone would not be Ifan, or any of the Federation staff assisting with the preparation efforts. It had to be someone local; someone who could claim to actually lead the planet. Preferably, this address would come from the planetary Administrator or some other similarly high-ranking official. Unfortunately, everyone more than a few ranks above ground level staff had fled, and that meant sending a nervous-looking floor manager in front of the cameras to address the planet.
    
    Ifan kept glancing at his watch as the broadcast aired, the pale, sweating human thankfully managing to keep his composure enough to avoid stumbling over his words. He spoke of the dire peril the planet and its population was facing, and of their instructions to weather it. Seek shelter underground if possible, or indoors at ground level if not. Stay out of the sunlight as much as possible. Shut down all electronic devices for the duration of the storm and prepare for weeks-to-years of restoration efforts.
    
    Activity in the capital started to slow as communications started to go offline in preparation for the impact. A number of staffers were still on calls with various power providers, who simply couldn’t respond fast enough to spin down their plants in time. He could hear shouting even through the headsets as operators begged for anything they could do to avert the disaster. There was nothing. The preparations simply hadn’t been made ahead of time.
    
    Eerie, wailing sirens began to howl across the city and Ifan listened as the gaggle of engineers from earlier coordinated with operators in two dozen separate generator plants across the metro area to begin the process of raising the city’s shield. There wasn’t anything more he could do at this point; they were out of time. He walked to a window to look over the city.

It was quiet and still now; no modern starship could escape the gravity well and jump to warp before the storm with less than ten minutes remaining. Even if they could, the shield - slowly flickering into existence over the city in a grid of hexagonal blue lines - prevented any ships from passing through. For better or worse, everyone was stuck where they were.
    
    The city’s lights stayed on as the sun gleamed brighter and hotter overhead, as if in defiance. No one under the shield had to shut anything down. No one lucky enough to be here was in any direct danger.
    
    Warning sirens screamed into empty streets as the shield bloomed into full strength. The sky, and the red giant star looming above, were obscured through a thick, blurry layer of protective blue light.
    
    “One minute!” someone shouted. The sun appeared to grow larger in the sky, though Ifan knew it was only the plasma stream inching closer at terrifying speed. He watched, and he spared a moment to bow his head for those outside the protection of any of the shields.
    
    The storm hit.
    
    Brilliant flares of multicolored light filled the sky along with a low roar, like the sound of a tornado ripping through a town. Streams of light blazed from generator masts into the sky as the shield absorbed and reflected the furious blast. People gasped and stepped back from windows, awed by the horrible power of their parent star. Above, satellites sparked and died as transformers and transmission lines detonated on the ground far below. Fires erupted on the planet’s vast plains, scorching away vegetation and structures alike in a band hundreds of miles across. The shields still held.

    <em>Scene 8</em>
    Euvi slid a finger across her forehead, brushing a lock of dark grey (light black?) hair out of her eyes. She sat up quickly this morning, one arm resting on her mass of pillows as the other arranged her hair. Something was different.
    
    She pondered this as she got up and went through her morning routine, before eventually arriving on an answer: the air conditioning unit was working harder - and was thus louder - than usual. Curious, Euvi detoured to the floor hatch before checking her daily tasks - eight today, quite a lot - and popped it open to see if anything was different below.
    
    A blast of hot, dry air flared up at her and Euvi actually gasped, scrambling away and blinking to re-moisten her eyes. She quickly shut the hatch, apologizing to the air conditioner as it cranked up even further. That temperature below wasn’t just hot; it was <em>boiling</em>. Was she going to have to go out there? That could be deadly!
    
    More surprises awaited as she checked the day’s tasks. Each one was nearly identical - replacing a “combined field diagnostics module” - and each one carried the same warning of “excessive heat: thermal regulator required.” What really stood out to her, though, was the map. Usually her tablet contained a sphere of corridors and rooms about 25 miles in every direction, but today’s map simply stopped in a great curve less than a mile away. Was it an error, or... She hardly dared to even lend voice to the thought, but... Was that... the edge?
    
    Still stewing over the map, Euvi opened the capsule waiting for her before getting dressed. As expected, today’s breakfast was less lavish than the day before, but what she was really looking for was the plastic-wrapped package labeled “THERMAL REGULATOR” in blocky letters. Unwrapping it revealed a sleek black box clipped to a series of fabric straps as well as a brief operator’s manual. She blinked and began to read.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1048669544966799370 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1048669544966799370><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="03-Dec-22 01:38 PM">13:38</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Minutes later, Euvi had dressed, eaten, and strapped the thermal regulator to her thigh in the way the instruction booklet demonstrated. It hummed as she clicked it on, and Euvi shivered as the ambient temperature suddenly seemed to plummet ten degrees. She messed with the settings until she felt comfortable, quietly marveled at the wondrous piece of technology, then popped open the hatch and descended into the oven outside.
    
    With the thermal regulator, the temperature only seemed marginally warmer than usual, and she in fact turned it down a little further to experience the novelty of being a little chilly before returning it to a comfortable setting. The regulator claimed the exterior temperature was approaching 200 F, and Euvi believed it. Heat waves shimmered in the air and any water she dropped outside her bubble of thermal protection quickly steamed away. But to her, the temperature was pleasantly in the low 70s.
    
    The tablet informed her that several of the nearby drop points had already received replacement diagnostic modules to replace the damaged ones, so Euvi stopped by one of them first. There, she was dismayed to find a much larger chute than normal, containing a capsule at least as tall as she was. After a strenuous effort to get the capsule out of the chute and crack it open, Euvi was rewarded with a heavy, chunky module larger than her entire torso and packed with dozens of different colored wires. The whole thing was wrapped in clear plastic.
    
    “I am - I’m to carry <em>eight</em> of these?!” she exclaimed to no one in particular. She wrapped her arms around it and heaved, but couldn’t even lift it off the floor. She had to drag it. “This... is impossible,” she gasped after only reaching the drop point’s door, feeling warmth from the exertion battle the pleasant coolness from the thermal regulator.

Now empty, it was much lighter and she could send it away without issue. Another capsule arrived in its place, smaller, and she opened this one too.
    
    A thin black rod slid out, roughly the length of her forearm. It split into two prongs on one end and had a rubber grip on the other, so she was clearly intended to hold it there. Thankfully, this one came with instructions just like the thermal regulator, and Euvi was quickly able to determine its use as a sort of gravitational stasis device. She could touch the prongs to the module, press the button on the grip, then just lift the entire box by moving the rod around. Hardly any effort required.
    
    “This one should have come first,” she told the drop point, sending the empty capsule back and receiving another module in return.
    
    A while later, Euvi arrived at the first of the eight damaged modules, carrying a replacement in front of her with the rod. This area of the station seemed... different. The metal paneling was of a different color, and she could hear a constant low roar from somewhere in front of her. Checking her map, Euvi almost jumped to note that she was now at the very edge of it. Zooming in to the closest level, she estimated she was less than twenty feet from the... <em>something</em> that was beyond.
    
    But even aside from the paneling, the temperature, and the constant bone-rattling roar, something else was different. Euvi had to sit down for a moment, glancing at her arms, before she noticed: her skin was a different color! Obviously, skin didn’t just change color on its own, so that meant the lighting was different here. She left the modules alone for a moment and did a quick circuit of the space, trying to locate the source of the unusual lighting.

Near the rear of the small, cramped room, a set of paneling had ripped apart and left a narrow rift through the wall... off the edge of the map. Euvi peeked through, but couldn’t make out much beyond an omnipresent red glare.
    
    She glanced at the map, then the rift again. Looked down at herself; tried to squeeze her torso to be as skinny as possible. Lined up her body against the rift and gauged the fit.
    
    ... Could she?
    
    ... Dare she?
    
    It would be a very tight fit; too tight to bring anything with her. Maybe even too tight to squeeze <em>herself</em> through. She could get hurt; she could get stuck; she could get killed. This was <em>definitely</em> not her assigned task.

    <em>Scene 9</em>
    “...”
    
    No. No, she didn’t dare.
    
    Euvi pulled back from the ripped panels and returned to the modules, busying herself by disconnecting the existing structure before slotting the new one into place and hooking up all the wires again. All the while, as she cut wires apart and twined them back together, she kept glancing over at the glaring, red-lit hole.
    
    The edge of the map. She had dreamt of this day for... ever, probably. Whatever formed the universe outside of the station lurked just beyond the wall, and she wasn’t even going to look? It wasn’t her place to look, and it could be dangerous. Probably was, given how hot it was here. Maybe the outside was where all the heat came from, and she’d be burnt up if she went out there? But the thermal regulator would help, but it probably wasn’t designed for temperatures like that, but...
    
    She wavered back and forth for a while, before eventually finishing the replacement and standing up. Euvi hesitated for a few more moments, aware that she should probably move on to the next module now, before not doing that. Instead, she scooped up a few chunks of metal debris formerly from the wall, positioned herself to see as best she could through the rift, and tossed a handful of scraps in.
    
    Most of the metal bounced off the jagged sides and fell to the floor, but some made it through. With them as references, Euvi could see... still not much. The scraps vanished from view and clattered down a slope of some unknown material, coming to rest somewhere below. Nothing else seemed to happen.
    
    Without any real way to tell how dangerous the other side of the rift was, Euvi reluctantly left it alone, berating herself for cowardice most of the way back to the drop point to return the broken module for reprocessing.

These capsules were much larger than normal; bigger than she was. What would happen if she stuffed herself into a capsule and rocketed off through the tubes? Were there people checking the returned parts, or would she just be incinerated? There wasn’t really a way to know; the thought drifted away as she idly looked down the chute in both directions. Nothing but dark, smooth tubing. No answers there either.
    
    Euvi pulled herself together after that, shaking off some of the morning’s discomfort to work her way through the next six modules without further incident. Each one took a long time, with all the re-wiring she had to do to connect the new one, and all of the rooms had sustained some level of damage to the paneling. None of them had any rifts leading to the edge of the map, though they were all positioned very close to it. She tried not to think about it too much, instead simply chatting to the modules as she worked. Explaining the procedures as if she were a doctor operating on them. Telling the old modules not to worry as she bundled them into capsules and shoved them into the pneumatic abyss. Lying. She had no idea if they should worry or not, but maybe it made them feel better as they shot through miles of tubes at blistering speed.
    
    The seventh module gave her some trouble. She hauled it all the way over, disconnected the old one, and connected the new one, but it refused to turn on. She double-checked all the connections, scanned the joinings with her tablet, and even inspected the station wiring itself for damage, but couldn’t get the thing to work. She had to bring it <em>and</em> the old one all the way back, then sit and wait for nearly half an hour for a replacement to be prepared and shipped over. The drop point kept saying “arrival imminent,” but it actually took nearly fifteen minutes after it first said that for the capsule to arrive.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1049391681348325477 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1049391681348325477><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="05-Dec-22 01:27 PM">13:27</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Then she had to lug the replacement replacement <em>all the way back over</em>, hook it up <em>again</em>, and... “You are joking me!” she shouted, punching the side of the module and then wincing as her hand flared with pain. “Why not turn on? Come on, you want to work, right?”
    
    In the end, it took her nearly another full hour of frustrated rooting around in the ceiling just above the module to finally work out the issue, then <em>another</em> trip back to the drop point for the replacement coupler she needed, then <em>finally</em>, <em>blessedly</em>, the thing turned on.
    
    Euvi sat down on the floor after all that, breathing heavily and wiping sweat from her forehead. Even with the thermal regulator, she still felt hot from all the exertion. “Good,” she grumbled. “Know your place. And stay that way, please.”
    
    Of course, the module made no reply. She pretended it was too scared of her, or appreciative, or something, to talk back.
    
    From there, it was another tired walk to the last drop point, where she picked up the last module. However, before she could make it out the door to head for the last location, her tablet beeped a warning. “1 hour remaining in cycle,” read the alert.
    
    Euvi stopped, her earlier frustration boiling towards something resembling anger. She had wandered pretty far from her living compartment at this point, but could probably make it back in about 40 minutes of walking. However, that would leave the last module un-repaired, her tasks unfinished, and she wouldn’t get any food tomorrow as a punishment.

She had stayed out past the end of a cycle only once, just to see what would happen, clinging to the ladder of her compartment with one hand holding the hatch open just in case. Every light on the station had gone out and terrible groaning noises had echoed from the walls. She had lasted maybe fifteen seconds in the terrifying cacophony before scrambling up the ladder, locking the hatch, and hiding in the normalcy of her compartment. Nothing had happened to her that night or the following morning, so either the station didn’t care or it hadn’t noticed.
    
    But trying to walk back, in the dark, with those noises everywhere? Was that really worth a day of food?
    
    ... She was already pretty hungry after today’s work.

    <em>Scene 10</em>
    Euvi hesitated, pacing between the corridor that would take her to the last module and the one that would take her back to her compartment. Then she jumped, aware she was burning valuable time with indecision, and... picked up the module. She jogged down the hallway towards the last task, numbly cold with the shock of what she had just decided.
    
    The last module cooperated, but it still took her a while to undo and redo all the connections. Only twenty minutes remained by the time she finished hooking up the replacement and turned it on to receive the little checkmark on the tablet that indicated she had finished all her tasks today. Only ten minutes remained by the time she made it back to the drop point, out of breath from running the whole way. And fewer than five minutes remained by the time she had jammed the old module into a capsule and sent it back.
    
    <em>Maybe I should just stay here overnight?</em> The drop point rooms had sturdy doors and only one entrance to keep shut. If anything dangerous roamed the halls after dark...
    
    Euvi scrambled into the hallway, her composure breaking, and sprinted towards the compartment as fast as she could manage without running into a wall. There were other drop points, but the closer she could get to her compartment before the lights shut off, the better.
    
    She ran hard, already exhausted from a long day of work, legs and lungs aching, sweat trickling down her forehead despite the thermal regulator’s still-perfect climate control. Shoes clanged on metal floors and grates, slipping occasionally as she tried to take corners too fast and nearly slammed into walls or railings. The tablet suddenly beeped urgently and she anxiously slowed to read the message.
    
    “End of cycle. Return to compartment.”

Near-silence echoed for a few moments as unending fans spun and some distant mechanism whirred to life. Then, just as that time years ago on the ladder, horrible groaning noises began to echo from the walls.
    
    Euvi shrank back into the middle of the corridor, eyes wide with fear, peering urgently in both directions for any hint of light. None came, which left her tablet’s dim screen as the only source of illumination. The map showed her an estimate of thirty minutes away from her compartment at a normal pace, but she couldn’t <em>manage</em> a normal pace with the lights out, her eyes dazzled by the tablet every time she referenced the map. She could hardly see more than a few feet in front of her.
    
    Her quick, shuddering breaths seemed far too loud. She opened her mouth to try and say something - to reassure herself or the tablet, perhaps - but could only manage a strangled squeak. <em>Just walk. Just move. Just get back. It is okay. You are okay.</em>
    
    Minutes passed in the dark. Euvi had to keep checking the map - blinding herself with its glare - then turning it away to light the path that she now couldn’t see without the aid of her night vision. It was a slow, painful process, made even worse by the constant groaning noises that varied in pitch and intensity seemingly at random. She just couldn’t get used to them; it felt like there was always some imagined monster just a few steps away in every direction.
    
    Twenty minutes to the compartment. She had spent nearly twenty minutes traveling the estimated ten so far. Her fingers felt cold and almost tingly; she turned up the regulator’s temperature. That didn’t seem to help.
    
    A different noise echoed in the distance. Metal scraping on metal; Euvi froze immediately.

One... Two... Three... Four... Five... Six... Sev-
    
    Again. Closer this time, echoing from somewhere in front of her.
    
    Euvi trembled; it felt like her already-too-fast heart rate had tripled. She fumbled with the tablet, turning off the screen and throwing her into total pitch blackness. Pressed against the side of the corridor, trying to squeeze into a little indent that housed some sort of access panel.
    
    <em>Scraaaaaaaaape.</em>
    
    The tablet almost slipped from her numb, frigid fingers; she had to fumble to catch it and squeezed it to her chest.
    
    A whirring, whipping sound became audible, mixing with the scraping. Euvi couldn’t move at this point; her eyes were locked on the slow, dim blur of red light spreading around the corner. The tablet’s corners dug into her hands and ribs where she held it. Too cold again, but the regulator’s controls were out of reach. All the way down on her thigh.
    
    The anticipation built unbearably, until finally the scraping, whirring Thing revealed itself. A squat, bulky machine moved along the floor, large rotating bristles scrubbing against all four sides of the hallway. Dim red lights glowed from several spots near the center of the Thing’s main body. These spots constantly moved and flicked about, casting illuminant cones in varying directions beyond the main glow. The Thing seemed to roll on wheels or tracks, juddering along unevenly with one side of its lower section sometimes scraping against the floor or wall with the loud, metallic sound that had originally clued her in on its presence.
    
    Euvi held her breath as the Thing rumbled closer, its dim red spotlights weaving ever nearer to her hiding place. She had to move; she had to run; she had to do SOMETHING! If she stayed put it would run right over her with those giant, rotating brushes! What its purpose could be, she couldn’t fathom in her current state of blind panic. She just knew she had to ACT!

    <em>Scene 11</em>
    She remembered passing a few side corridors not far back, and the hallway was no longer utterly black with the introduction of the Thing’s light. With a panicked shudder, Euvi pried herself out of the indent and scrambled down the hall, senses straining for the faint signs that would tell her where to turn. Darker blackness, longer echoes, a slight drift of wind; there! She turned in the dark, aiming for the - WHAM!
    
    Blazing pain throbbed through her head and thick, metallic liquid spilled from her nose. Euvi sat up - she didn’t remember falling - and felt around for her dropped tablet with one hand while pressing against her head with the other.
    
    The Thing beeped behind her, lights sweeping the passage faster than before. The pitch of its wheels changed. Euvi glanced back, vision and balance unsteady, and screamed to find the machine barely twenty feet back and quickly rolling closer. Most of its spotlights were trained on her now, and a low, dangerous whine was building deep in the Thing’s body.
    
    Her hands found the tablet and she leapt off the ground, glimpsing the small splatter of blood where she had run into the wall as she turned. She stumbled against the same wall again, head still ringing from the impact, then clicked on the tablet’s screen and ran for it.
    
    Behind her, the Thing’s whine crescendoed and then dropped away entirely to such a low frequency Euvi couldn’t hear it. Little blobs of darkness swam in her vision and she nearly fell several more times as her muscles twitched in ways she didn’t intend. But she was much faster than the Thing and after turning a few corners, the blobs and twitches went away. The splitting headache, dizziness, and trickling blood from her nose remained.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1050919563216302100 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1050919563216302100><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="09-Dec-22 06:39 PM">18:39</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She sprinted mostly at random for what seemed like a very long time, primarily just trying to put as much distance between her and the Thing as possible, but also checking the map every so often to try and head in vaguely the right direction. She nearly ran into a wall three more times - and actually did once, cracking the tablet’s screen as it hit first to protect her body - but managed to avoid further serious injury.
    
    A few minutes into her flight, Euvi heard something else that caused her to slow and turn off the light again, hiding until the sounds vanished further into the darkness. It sounded almost like an angle grinder, mixed with intermittent screeches reminiscent of powerful hand saws. But, worse than the noises themselves was the direction they moved in. The second, different Thing screamed in from her left several intersections back, heading directly towards the first Thing. As if it had been summoned.
    
    Thankfully, this second Thing never came close enough to see.
    
    After an amount of time that seemed endless in the moment but was close to fifty minutes in reality, Euvi finally arrived at the ladder. She climbed up without hesitation, slid into the welcoming light of her compartment, and locked the hatch with extreme precision.
    
    Then, she simply fell to the smooth metal floor and caught her breath, trembling.
    
    ...
    
    Hours later, Euvi lay in bed, wide awake despite her exhaustion. She had gotten cleaned up and treated her face as best she could; her nose didn’t seem broken, so it would probably heal without too much issue. She was still unsteady on her feet and her head still throbbed occasionally, though she had taken medicine to help. Hopefully that would go away after a night’s rest.

So far, nothing had happened. The system hadn’t noted any infractions or requested the thermal regulator or gravity wand back, so she had just set them on the table for now. No terrible creatures had emerged from below to slaughter her. It was just like every other night on the station, except for the memories of what she had just witnessed.
    
    The first Thing had been a cleaning robot. She was reasonably sure of that, now that she had some time to calm down and think it through. The rotating brushes, the slow movement, the reason it would be there at all; it added up. She had even noticed the paneling behind the robot looking much shinier than that in front of it, though she hadn’t paid attention at the time.
    
    So why had it attacked her? And how? What would it have done if she hadn’t gotten away?
    
    ... And what was the <em>second</em> Thing that had responded to the first?
    
    The air conditioner began to hiss quietly, spreading a sweet scent through the room. Euvi yawned, her eyelids finally getting heavy and her residual panic starting to fade. She had stayed up too late; she was usually asleep by the time this happened. Idly, as she drifted off, she wondered if maybe this was a cleaning routine too. Spraying a fresh scent? She cleaned her own compartment, but maybe...
    
    Euvi fell asleep.

    <em>Scene 12</em>
    “Jin!” Claril called, rushing down the unadorned corridor. Her right knee protested at the hustle, twanging with pain from an old injury. She really shouldn’t have skipped the last maintenance appointment for her cybernetic. “Jin! Hey!”
    
    The naxisant finally noticed her and turned, his ghostly, membranous wings fluttering. “Claril?” He spoke in a high-pitched, nasally manner and was almost skeletally thin, like most of his kind. Naxisants were often subject to discrimination and name-calling, particularly from umians (their ancient enemies) and humans (who found them creepy and a passable match for the vampire myth).
    
    Jin La’Rojin, however, had risen to prominence here on Amira Station as one of its foremost scientists studying the star and its interaction within the temporal field. After over a decade of distinguishing himself, he was promoted to the Assistant Director of Station Operations about a year ago. As one of Claril’s colleagues before his promotion, she still kept in contact.
    
    She puffed to a stop in front of his group, noting the handful of people in dull yellow jumpsuits accompanying him. Those would be maintenance workers. She couldn’t tell if that was a good sign or not. “Jin, what the hell is happening? The Director and half of admin are still gone, we just lost another section of stabilizers, and nobody will give me a straight answer. Honestly, I expected <em>you</em> to be gone, too. None of the other department heads seem to be here anymore.”
    
    Jin glanced at the maintenance workers. “Go ahead on your own,” he instructed. “I’ll catch up, but don’t wait for me. You know where to go and what to do.”

The deep void of space twinkled out a series of long windows to her right; the left was dull metal. Jin took a step closer and for a split second, Claril almost thought he was going to attack her. People had been going missing all day, after all.
    
    But he just held up a small tablet and turned it so she could see. It was another representation of the stasis field around Sibdael, but with unfamiliar abbreviations and scales. He suddenly seemed much more frail than he had been only moments before.
    
    “This diagram shows the stasis field’s cohesion, along with its relative rate of decay or restoration. Anything in blue or green means that field section is projected to stay stable until the station rotates around to restore it again, while anything in orange or red means it’s projected to destabilize. Black means it’s projected to collapse and damage the emitters. White is what we’re currently restoring. Do you see the problem?”
    
    Claril spun the 3D model with her finger, eyes widening as she took in the amount of orange, red, and black. Hardly a third of the sun was still colored blue or green, and the white patch that represented the station’s current position as it fueled and restored the field had a number of missing segments within its outline. “... Yeah, I see the problem.”
    
    “It should <em>all</em> be blue or white, Claril. Even green is a problem; orange is a big issue and red is a disaster. But black...” He sighed, sliding the tablet back into his bag and clicking his sharp teeth together in a way that indicated deep concern according to Claril’s translator. “If nothing changes, we’re done for in a matter of weeks. Maybe less, if the sun keeps getting worse.”
    
    “...”

Boom. Say goodbye to anything left in the entire Sibdael system, and a good chunk of the local sector.”
    
    “... Why now? What <em>happened?</em>”
    
    Jin moved his wings in a noncommittal manner akin to a shrug. “Not sure. Maybe the star got sick of being frozen in time for centuries. Maybe 400 years is enough time that some irreplaceable bits of the station started to fail. Maybe things have gone wrong that we don’t have sensors for. I don’t know, unfortunately.”
    
    “Those workers, then...”
    
    “Rushing off to hold this damn thing together. Restoration arrays keep failing in a cascading pattern, almost as fast as we can fix them. I’ve got the entire professional crew on it and we’re even considering bringing in the...” He trailed off, seeming to remember who he was talking to. “The reserves. But no matter how fast we can work, we’re going to run out of parts before long, especially since Sibdael II is in no shape to produce replacements anymore.” He barked a short laugh without any humor to it. “Not until it gets blasted into plasma by this star’s explosion.”
    
    “Jin... Who else <em>knows</em> about this? Are we evacuating? What’s going <em>on?</em>”
    
    “Until right now? No one but trusted supervisors in my team, plus upper admin. Not even the guys I just sent off know exactly what’s going on, though they’re probably wondering why they’ve only been working on restoration arrays for the past few days.” He breathed out tiredly. “The Director told us to keep quiet; that he had a plan; not to panic people. But now...”
    
    “He’s gone.”
    
    “Yeah. Along with - surprise surprise - most everyone in admin who knew about this. Except me.”

    <em>Scene 13</em>
    Claril frowned, considering. “If the star truly is about to explode - even if we can do something about it - then I think this matter is a bit bigger than us. The Federation is already working on the current disaster on Sibdael II, and we’ll need help to coordinate with everyone else in the local sector.”
    
    “You think we should involve the <em>Federation?</em>”
    
    “Well, I mean, that’s what it’s <em>for</em>, right? Central management of problems bigger than any one system? I think what we have here definitely counts.”
    
    Jin paused, then nodded abruptly. “Very well. There’s already an officer on Sibdael II assisting with the crisis response; you can start with him.”
    
    “Me?”
    
    “You know enough to get across the grave nature of this situation we’re in, and I am needed here to ensure the timeline doesn’t accelerate any further. I wouldn’t trust anyone else to manage this properly, to be honest. Not after most of my superiors disappeared.”
    
    “I suppose... Okay. I can do that. But I’ll need your help; like you said, we can’t evacuate everyone in time, so we’ll need to buy as much of it as we can. Do you think we can fix the station? If not permanently, at least long enough to last a year instead of a week?”
    
    Jin’s wings fluttered again as he replied. “I don’t know. It depends on exactly what the problem is, how fast we can figure that out, how many replacement components we can acquire, how quickly we can install them, and on and on. I wouldn’t get your hopes up, if only because I have <em>never</em> seen any readings like what we currently have and the longer they go on, the more emitters will be permanently destroyed.”
    
    “Is that going to cause more of these eruptions?”

The star will continue to leak through the field in more locations and with higher intensity until it overcomes the total cohesion strength. At that point, the field will break entirely and the star will explode, essentially instantly. Possibly even faster than an ‘ordinary’ supernova, due to all the temporal dilation. It would be absolutely fascinating to study, if it weren’t about to wipe out an entire star system. And if we had any instruments that could survive the blast.”
    
    “We’ll need to warn the monitoring staff to be on alert, then. Especially if maintenance can’t get to the diagnostic modules in time; were those missed because all your staff were busy with the restoration arrays?” <em>Careful. Nudge him in the right direction; don’t shove.</em> Claril had noticed his discomfort when mentioning the “reserves,” and something told her it would be more effective to ask indirectly.
    
    “Not... exactly. There have been some recent... issues with the ghosts, but there just hasn’t been time to look into it. So, I suppose, indirectly...”
    
    “Ghosts? Did my translator get that wrong?”
    
    Jin froze for a moment. “Ah, likely. It is an expression in my language, referring to... unknown glitches with the station’s internals.”
    
    “So if you’re short of staff to investigate, why not bring in the reserves, like you mentioned earlier? I didn’t even know we had any off-duty maintenance staff.”
    
    He grimaced. “That... may not exactly be the right word either...”
    
    <em>Okay, enough nudging. Time to shove.</em> “Jin, please be straight with me. We both know you’re hiding something, and <em>now</em>, with all this going on, is definitely not the time. We need to know all the resources we have available to deal with this.”

    Jin rushed off down the hallway before Claril could stop him. She stared after the departing naxisant, one hand raised as if to call him back. <em>Did his diction change after I started prying?</em>
    
    Well, he was right that she had other important duties to attend to. But something about how he acted made her file away what little she knew about these “ghosts” for later interrogation. For now, it was time to track down that Officer X’deven who had been handling matters on Sibdael II. He would know what to do. Hopefully.

    <em>Scene 14</em>
    Ifan checked one of the external cameras on his starship, gazing back over the planet below as he climbed out of its gravity well. Even from here, he could see Sibdael II burning. Vast swathes of foliage - dried out from a mellow autumn - had ignited in the sunstorm and started devastating wildfires that now raged across much of the planet. People who had survived the initial impact, many now without communication or power infrastructure, had suddenly been thrust into yet another disaster as flames licked at their walls.
    
    He cut the feed, wishing he could be down there saving lives. Nearly every operational starship on the planet - and many from the other three inhabited planets in the system - had been pressed into service to assist with evacuations and supply runs. The operation was going... not fantastically, as it was very difficult to coordinate and figure out where to go without a modern communications network. Emergency comm buoys, satellites, and other infrastructure were already on their way to the system, but it had only been a few hours. They’d need days or longer to get situated properly.
    
    “Ready to jump,” his ship stated in a calm, neutral tone. Ifan clicked the lever forward, initiating the pre-planned route he had plotted just a few minutes ago. The ship shuddered gently and distant stars faded to near-translucency as he dipped partially into hyperspace. He didn’t need to go all the way in today since he couldn’t safely accelerate to fully superluminal speeds with all the nearby gravity wells. Thankfully, his destination wasn’t another system; it was Amira Station. Orbiting just a few hundred kilometers above the surface of the star, it was only a dozen light minutes away. He’d arrive in a little over a quarter hour.

The local government and Federation agents could handle that situation better than he could, and he had more pressing matters to investigate. Clearly, something was terribly wrong with Amira Station, and it was his duty to determine what it was.
    
    A gentle pulse of noise and blue light informed Ifan of an incoming call. Someone from HQ, apparently. “Yes?” he answered tersely.
    
    “Officer X’deven.” A youngish voice, probably human based on the accent. Harder to tell with the translators, but still possible. He made the assessment without even thinking about it. “Someone from Amira Station wants to speak with you. A scientist. Says she’s got incredibly dangerous, urgent news for you.”
    
    “Why am I not surprised? Okay, you still have her on the line?”
    
    “Uh, no, sir. Said she wanted to show you if possible. Are you almost at the station?”
    
    “Fifteen minutes out. Give me a dock and a name and I’ll meet her right away.”
    
    “Understood. I’ll find a location and call you back. The name is Claril Hvet. Human, orange hair, blue eyes. Enough of a description to go on?”
    
    “Should be.”
    
    ...
    
    Half an hour later, Ifan walked down his ship’s ramp, scanning the hangar. Not many other ships were docked here right now - even Amira Station’s fleet had been largely commandeered for the disaster at Sibdael II - but a handful of smaller vessels were being loaded with large mechanical components by crews in dull yellow jumpsuits. He paused a moment to study them: massive antenna-like structures with bulky bases and focusing rings. Interesting.

He hurried along the hangar floor, staying out of the way of the yellow jumpsuit crews, and approached her. She was a human woman of moderate height, probably in her late 30s, with blue eyes and light orange hair currently tied back in a braid. Favored her right knee, just a little, and wore a grey-blue sweater.
    
    “Dr Hvet, I presume?” Ifan shook her hand, helpfully reminded of the correct gesture to make by his translator. Humans had a hard time with the traditional umian greeting, as they lacked any motor control over their hair. “Officer Ifan X’deven of the Galactic Federation. I heard you have some very important news to share?”
    
    She swallowed hard, seeming shaken by something. Probably the news. “Yes, but it’s... sensitive information. If you don’t mind, I can show you the details in my office.”
    
    “Lead the way.”
    
    Another half an hour later, Ifan was deeply concerned. Dr Hvet had explained the basics of how the station operated, then had very quickly gotten to the main point: the star Sibdael was breaking through the field and would likely detonate into a supernova in about a week’s time. He followed up with more questions, in turn learning a little of Jin, the ghosts, and the missing executives.
    
    “I’ll need to speak with this Jin, and quickly. I was originally called to this system to investigate possible violations of sentient rights, and these ‘ghosts’ and all the disappearing officials just before something like this... It doesn’t look good, to be honest.” He paced to the other side of the office, staring out at the sun and still speaking. “But of course, that’s all secondary to the by-far bigger problem.”
    
    “The supernova. Officer, do you think there’s any way the Federation can help us evacuate the system before it blows?”

But even with our entire disaster relief fleet <em>and</em> a good portion of the military reserves...” He did a few quick calculations, estimating.
    
    “There’s not a chance we’ll get everyone out in time. Not even close; there aren’t enough ships, but there also aren’t enough spaceports, supplies, fuel depots, or even nearby places to <em>send</em> tens of billions of refugees. At least, not in a week. Maybe in a year, but with the time scale you’re discussing... I’m afraid the vast majority of the population simply can’t be moved that fast.” Ifan hissed in frustration. “Why was this a <em>surprise</em> to anyone? This station has been operating for how long?”
    
    “About 400 years.”
    
    “Four centuries! Why has <em>nothing</em> been done to prepare to leave the system?! This was all supposed to be temporary, right?” He sighed, hair strands deflating somewhat. “This stinks of either a <em>monumental</em> failure of civic planning, or a purposeful, longstanding, willful ignorance of the biggest danger this system has ever faced.”
    
    He paused, glancing at Claril. Thankfully, she didn’t look too shaken by his outburst. Ifan cleared his throat, returning to a more even tone. “Apologies. I’ll work on getting a fleet together as soon as possible. If you can-”
    
    “The Director was in on it.”
    
    “Pardon me?”
    
    “He told Jin to keep everything hidden and that he had a plan. Then he vanished, at around the same time as the Administrator and most of their staff. This wasn’t an uncoordinated ‘officials run away to avoid blame for a disaster’ - this was a ‘criminals escape before they can be caught.’ I bet if you check the other planetary governments, their leaders will have gone, too.”

Regardless, we can’t get caught up in that until we’ve done what we can for the population of this system.”
    
    “Right. So, what’s the plan?”
    
    [Ifan will begin by notifying the Federation to assist in a system-wide evacuation, and to discreetly coordinate with other systems in the blast radius to ensure they can either evacuate or weather the storm. Beyond that...]

    <em>Scene 15</em>
    “Look, Ifan,” Valeria Nomano huffed into her headset. “I don’t know what you want me to do about this. You <em>know</em> we don’t have much influence out there. Where do you want me to put the population of an entire star system? Just send them off to float in deep space?”
    
    Ifan’s voice was delayed as he replied, bouncing through a galaxy’s worth of comm buoy satellites to make it back to Gamma Veox in the core. “Can we maintain them on the ships for a journey back to the coreworlds?”
    
    She shook her head as if he could see her. “I can’t get you the big transports in time, remember? They’re en route, but it’ll take week<em>s</em>, not <em>a</em> week. Best you’ll have are some of the military cruisers and carriers, and those things aren’t set up for long-term habitation of that many people. Plus, even if we could, you think Strillia or any of the Veoxes, for instance, are going to want billions of rural refugees dumped on their doorstep? Think <em>politically</em>; we’d have to split them up to even have a chance of getting them accepted for immigration.”
    
    He sighed deeply and Val briefly smiled despite the situation. She was the one who had taught him that expression years ago, when they had been classmates in their Federation training. “Well, I don’t know then, Val. I need you to come up with something, though, because I’m not about to let billions of innocent people die just because of politics. You can find <em>somewhere</em> to put them. I know you can.”
    
    “I’ll talk to the other sector systems and try to get some cooperation. That’s got to be easier than trying to get everyone back to the core, especially if we offer to help cover the cost.” She spoke a little more quietly, though Ifan could still hear. “That is, if the Senate will approve disaster relief funding...”
    
    Another long pause as the buoys relayed her message. “Is this really what you’ve been up to all this time, Val? Up to your neck in politics this, funding that?”

Up to your neck in supernova this, system-wide evacuations that?”
    
    “Admittedly, this mission is... larger than normal. Sorry; I was just thinking I’d never survive a month in your job. I’d snap at some politician and get carted away on ‘administrative leave.’”
    
    “Well, I wouldn’t survive in your job either. Though that’s more because of the fact that you get into firefights on a non-negligible basis.”
    
    “Listen, Val, I’m sorry-”
    
    “Shut it, X’deven. If you don’t accept it wasn’t your fault one of these times, I’m going to start taking it personally.”
    
    There was a pause, longer than the buoy delay. Finally, Val continued. “Anyway, back to the point. So far, we’ve gotten in contact with about 60% of the systems in your sector and every single one of them already has a solid plan in place for weathering the supernova. I’m not kidding; <em>every single one.</em> Most of those involve some sort of atmospheric shielding or restoration, and a lot of them don’t even have any physical infrastructure in place yet because it’ll take centuries for the blast wave to reach them. But according to our analysis, we don’t have to worry about any major systems besides Sibdael itself.”
    
    “That’s a relief. Anything on the missing officials?”
    
    “I’m not a miracle worker, Ifan.”
    
    “I doubt that. But, nothing, then?”
    
    “I <em>really</em> don’t know what you were expecting me to do for that one. I don’t have eyes out that far besides you, and they’d be crazy to flee into the core. No, my guess is your missing execs ran to the outer spiral somewhere and hunkered down till this whole thing blows over. Literally, heh.”

Well, too bad. You wanted Val’s help, you got her help <em>and</em> her personality. Package deal. Unfortunately, he didn’t say anything about it. “It was worth a try, at least. Alright, I’m off to go interrogate the operations manager I told you about. See if I can figure out more about everything going on here before we run low on time.”
    
    “The naxisant? Are you going to be okay talking to him?”
    
    “I’m a professional. Species has no-”
    
    “Not you; him. Just be careful; on top of the old grudge, I’m not sure I trust the person in charge of station maintenance to be telling you the whole truth as the station is falling apart around you. It’s just... a little fishy that he didn’t vanish along with everyone else, right?”
    
    “... You’re right. I’ll be careful. Talk to you soon, Val. Ifan out.”
    
    Val sighed and slid back from her desk, spinning the chair around absently. Her office rotated past; a picture caught her eye. Val and Ifan, arm in arm and sporting huge grins in their spotless Federation cadet uniforms, both holding their shiny new badges out for the camera. That had been just after graduation, when they had both intended to become field agents. Ifan had, but Val...
    
    “Pfeh,” she muttered, rotating around to face the desk again. “Not his fault; not my fault. Sometimes things just happen.”
    
    She’d keep telling herself that as many times as it took for her to believe it.
    
    “Anyway, better get back to it. Need to find him a few friendly systems for all these people.” A deep breath, a sigh out, then she tabbed over to her list of contacts. “Okay. Only thirty billion refugees to go.”

    <em>Scene 16</em>
    “So, can you outline the general process used for ongoing maintenance on the station? Procedure documentation would be helpful if present.”
    
    Ifan stood straight and on guard, facing Jin La’Rojin across a small conference room. He had been questioning the naxisant for a while already and had gotten through the background details; everything so far matched up with what Claril had told him. Now, it was time to probe a little more carefully.
    
    For his part, Jin also had the dignity to look uncomfortable. “The operational maintenance policies can be sent to you after this meeting, as you desire. In brief, then...”
    
    The assistant director continued, and Ifan ticked off areas of concern as they were mentioned. He didn’t actually care about the specifics of the station’s maintenance plan; he wanted to know if it had been purposefully sabotaged, perhaps by one of the missing executives. <em>Or Jin himself. He is a potential suspect as well.</em>
    
    “Pardon me, but can you go into more detail on the interior repairs? From what I’ve seen of the maps, it would take days to reach and replace a component near the center.”
    
    Jin hesitated, then continued relatively smoothly. “Pneumatics. We have several major chutes that allow for transport to and from the interior in a matter of hours rather than days.”
    
    “So you send maintenance personnel down one of these chutes when a defect is noticed, have them repair it, and return them to the surface?”
    
    “Almost. Much of the time, there are several issues to address at once, so they may stay in the interior for a longer term. But essentially, that is the process.”
    
    <em>Ah.</em> “How long of a term?”
    
    “Well...”
    
    ...
    
    Claril shuffled through the piles of paper in the former Director’s cabinets, fighting the urge to glance back at the door every few seconds. She technically wasn’t allowed to be here, but with the whole station falling apart anyway and the Director himself missing, she figured no one was going to stop her.

So here she was, digging through the Operations Director’s files for any sort of clue that she or Jin - or even Officer X’deven - could use.
    
    Of course, the computer and any digital-only files were long gone - not that she could have hacked in to unlock it anyway - but there were still plenty of strewn-about physical copies of reports, policies, memos, and so on. Many were marked as confidential, secret, or higher, and Claril grew more nervous as she sifted through a box labeled entirely with secret or top secret stamps. <em>Shouldn’t these have been locked up or in a vault or something?</em>
    
    Finally, she found something intelligible <em>and</em> relevant. Still concerned about being discovered, she slid the entire file under her sweater - couldn’t even tell - and hustled back to her office to read it.
    
    “Annual executive summary of live-in maintenance staff. Total population: roughly 2.18 million (down 3%). Breeding program: suspended indefinitely (year 10).”
    
    There were several more lines containing figures of various other metrics, which Claril didn’t really care about, so she skipped down to the prose section where the report’s author had written more freeform about the program.
    
    “The live-in maintenance staff, or ‘ghosts,’ to use the shortened name, continue to operate extremely efficiently compared to traditional maintenance personnel. The population continues to decline at an expected rate due to the termination of the breeding program; we estimate roughly eight years before the population is reduced beyond the number required for continued operation. We recommend restarting the breeding program immediately if the station’s life will be extended past this point.

Professional staff entered the system to remove the remains and repair major damage to the trunk line from the collision. We implemented additional monitoring in the arterial chutes to automatically shut down a section of the network and alert professional operators if intrusions are detected.
    
    “In the second, a ghost encountered a cleaning droid after the end of a scheduled cycle, during the standard interior refresh period. The ghost became distressed and caused severe damage to the droid using their work tools before returning to their compartment. Analysis of compartment recordings indicated an unsuitable mental state, so the ghost was terminated by airborne neurotoxin. Additional ghosts were instructed to clean up the destroyed droid, with no further issues. We also implemented additional features in the new cleaner model, including an aural disruptor and an automatic request for a hunter/killer drone in the event of further similar incidents.
    
    “In all, we find the ‘ghost’ program to be one of the highest-efficiency programs in Amira Station, and recommend continued operation until the designated end-of-life date.”

    <em>Scene 17</em>
    “Are you aware that your so-called ‘ghost’ program is <em>slavery?</em> That it violates a whole host of different galactic laws and could have most everyone who knew about it in prison for years?”
    
    “What would you have me do, Officer?” Jin asked calmly. “What should I have done, when I first learned of the ghosts? Should I have spoken out against their use and demanded we change the entire station’s operations? Requested we find the billions of credits required to pay them in an already-stretched budget? Tried to free them? I would have been fired, imprisoned, or worse. And if I had succeeded, there’s no telling what damage would have been done if the station’s maintenance were disrupted. Nothing is more important in this system - this sector - than keeping Amira Station operational for as long as possible. Removing the ghosts destroys the station. So tell me, what <em>should</em> I have done?”
    
    Ifan forced himself to consider the words and the situation. “Contact the appropriate authorities. You wouldn’t need to tell your superiors, the matter would be investigated, and you would...”
    
    The naxisant was smiling. “You came here due to an anonymous tip, did you not? One that mentioned allegations of sentient being rights violations? Officer, who do you think <em>submitted</em> that tip?”
    
    “...”
    
    “I won’t insult your intelligence by continuing further. Rest assured, I take these matters seriously, but at this point there’s very little we can do. The ghosts are required in order to maintain the station’s current operation, and we wouldn’t be able to extract them all within the time limit anyway. All of the current population were born within the interior and, unfortunately, will likely die there.”
    
    “They don’t deserve this. No one does.”
    
    “Precisely. No one does.” Jin folded his long fingers together, nodding at Ifan. “Officer, you understand as well as I do that it will be impossible to evacuate the entire system before Amira Station fails. Yes?”

    “Are you really willing to divert some of the already-limited resources away from evacuating innocents who have a good chance of surviving and adapting out in the greater galaxy, in order to evacuate innocents who have never seen the stars <em>and</em> whose removal might threaten the safety of the former group?”
    
    “...”
    
    “There’s a saying that you Federation types seem to like. ‘For the greater good.’ That’s how you justify conquering much of the galaxy. That’s how you justify your taxes and restrictions and military patrols. Don’t misunderstand me; much of the work the Federation does is commendable. It’s ‘for the greater good,’ after all. And leaving the ghosts exactly where they are, right up until the sun detonates, will be as well.”
    
    “It isn’t right to force people to sacrifice themselves just because they’ve never known of any other option.”
    
    “And yet, saving them will doom others. Perhaps many times more. How much good are you willing to leave undone just to avoid the evil?”
    
    Claril chose this moment to knock at the door, then enter after a gruff “come in” from Ifan. She glanced between the two of them - Ifan standing in an aggressive posture; Jin sitting calmly with hands folded - then held up a file. “I think this might be useful if you’re questioning him. It’s about the ghosts.”
    
    Ifan skimmed through as Jin stayed in place, expressionless. “Good timing, Dr Hvet. We had just finished talking about this.”
    
    “He... admitted it?”
    
    “I should have expected you would immediately go and look if I kept it hidden from you.” Jin sounded almost amused. “It’s that inquisitive mindset of yours. Well, I’ll tell you the same thing I told him: we need to keep the ghosts in place and working. To do otherwise at this point only invites greater disaster.”

The tiny red dot of Sibdael itself became visible through the bridge windows, its miniscule size from so far away belying its true, bloated form.
    
    The starship - a Federation freighter rerouted from its destination in nearby Otruul - was the first of many, many ships scheduled to arrive in the system over the following week to provide aid and evacuation to its residents. Though the ship was nearly half a mile long and could theoretically hold tens of thousands of refugees, or more, its sheer size meant that it couldn’t land in-atmosphere. Military ships of similar size were reinforced and generally could land, but freighters like this relied on shuttles or orbital docks to transfer cargo.
    
    Of course, the Sibdael system had none of the latter and many of the former had been damaged by the sun’s recent violence. It would be a slow, complicated process to load the vast cargo holds with living people, and that wasn’t even counting the logistics for food, hygiene, and medical care. You couldn’t just stuff thousands upon thousands of people in a box for days on end and expect them to be fine.
    
    Thoughts like these weighed heavily on the mind of the freighter’s aged captain as he watched the star slowly grow larger in the viewport. Finally, he nudged one of the other three crew members currently on the bridge - only twelve in total, even for a ship so large - and requested a call to the Federation official who had redirected him.
    
    “Val here. What do you need, captain?”
    
    The captain’s voice was frail, but plenty audible. “A destination and a local contact. We’re at Sibdael and need to know where to go from here.”
    
    “Really? Wow, you’re ahead of schedule; good job! Alright, let me see here...”

    <em>Scene 18</em>
    “Aim for Sibdael II. You’ll be getting into position above the capital, which has most of the few remaining spaceports still capable of sending shuttles up to meet you. I’ve got your contact as well; ready to copy?”
    
    Minutes later, the freighter had re-plotted its course and was again on its way. 
    
    ...
    
    “Good luck with that,” Jin said. “I appreciate the sentiment, but don’t delude yourself; trying to evacuate the ghosts after everyone else isn’t going to be possible. For starters, there’s no way you’ll actually be able to evacuate everyone else in the time we have, so the other points are moot regardless. But even beyond that, we won’t have warning when the sun actually blows. Sure, we have some approximations based on the field strength and sensor readings, but when that thing finally decides to detonate, this station will be destroyed in a matter of <em>minutes.</em> The rest of the system might have hours, but you may have noticed we’re rather close to it here. No, evacuating anyone from Amira Station itself will have to be done in advance, or we’ll have to abandon the staff here - ghost or otherwise - to death.”
    
    Ifan, infuriatingly, couldn’t see a flaw in the man’s logic. “We still have to try. We can’t just <em>plan</em> on abandoning them.”
    
    “And that’s why I wished you good luck. You will definitely need some.”

    Euvi was already awake by the time the three-tone chime sounded to wake her up. She had been deeply asleep for a while, but then woke up early, unable to breathe properly and with remnants of the headache from last night throbbing in her forehead. She had tried and failed to go back to sleep after cleaning the clogged blood from her nose and taking some additional medicine, instead spending the time repairing one of her pillows to try and calm down. The cleaner droid and the buzz saw-like second Thing kept haunting her memories.

Her compartment appeared to be in the same place as it had been yesterday, with the great curve on the map still visible about a mile away. Euvi clipped on the thermal regulator and slid the gravity wand into her bag, then descended back into the oven-like interior of the station. What else was she going to do?
    
    The morning passed in a blur as she hauled, replaced, and hauled back another set of heavy diagnostic modules - identical work to yesterday. That wasn’t unusual. What <em>was</em> unusual was the last task on her list for the day, scheduled for after lunch and with a very vague description. Euvi pulled it up on her tablet as she sat in a drop point and picked at a bowl of bland, grey mush.
    
    “Thermal regulator required,” she read aloud, mostly just to practice. “I already have one, so that is okay.”
    
    “Proceed... go to the marked location and submit to a bioscan. Enter the chamber lock and equip the protective suit found there.” She took a break to re-read the first sentences and try to get the pronunciation right. The word ‘bioscan’ was new to her, though she could guess at its meaning.
    
    “Enter the emitter housing and attempt freeform repair. Work until the emitter is repaired or until the end of cycle warning. No penalty will be assessed for failure to repair the emitter.”
    
    She frowned. “No penalty will be... ah... assessed?” Euvi was literate, but most of her vocabulary consisted of mechanical components and words relating to them. More abstract verbs just didn’t tend to be as important. “And... freeform repair? No instructions?”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1056028758932463639 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1056028758932463639><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="23-Dec-22 09:01 PM">21:01</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Indeed, the task contained no specific directions for what exactly was broken or how to fix it. That, combined with the “no penalty for failure” clause, made it stand out. There was a link to the schematics for this emitter, so she selected it. The tablet spun for a bit, quickly flashed a screen that contained many words Euvi didn’t know as well as a large red lock icon, then slowly loaded in a large diagram.
    
    Euvi’s eyes widened, taking in the size of the machine relative to the human silhouette near the bottom. “This is very big.”
    
    After lunch, Euvi walked through the hallways towards the task’s location. Interestingly, it was on the very edge of the map, right next to a moderately large protrusion out from the great curve. “The walls are red,” she remarked to no one in particular. “With a white stripe. There are words on the walls. They read... ‘auxiliary emitter 04-18,’ then ‘authorized personnel only.’ I am a person...nel? I do not know what kind of a person is an authorized person, but I think I am one. Since I was told to come here.”
    
    She paused, thoughtful, as she continued walking. The hallway grew wider and there were several very large drop points nearby. “I have not seen words on the walls before. This must be a very... special? place.”
    
    The door to the chamber lock was at least four times taller than Euvi, and roughly that wide. She approached a flat grey panel on the right side that looked important, considering it. “I need to go in,” she told it.
    
    The panel did not reply.
    
    Locked doors were unusual in the station. In fact, <em>any</em> doors were unusual, outside of drop points. “It said ‘bioscan’...” she thought aloud. “I am bio? Should I be scanned?” Hesitantly, Euvi tapped the panel with one hand.
    
    It lit up briefly, then spoke in a calm voice. “Keep your hand on the scanner.”
    
    “!!!” Euvi leapt back several paces, heart racing. “You... you can talk?! Are you a person?”
    
    The panel did not reply.

The panel lit up and a few seconds passed.
    
    “No match. Please try again.”
    
    Euvi only jumped back half as far this time, and returned much faster. “You are not speaking to me, are you? You speak to me, but not <em>to</em> me?”
    
    The panel did not reply.
    
    “Yes...” She sighed and tried again, her dream of meeting another real human being again unrealized. Some machines could just talk to you, it seemed.
    
    “No match. Please try again.”
    
    “I do not understand. Is this the bioscan?”
    
    “No match. Operator alerted. Please remain here and wait for assistance.”
    
    Euvi sat down on the metal floor, nonplussed. “I do not understand...” she muttered, before digging the tablet out again and re-reading the task in case she had somehow missed something. A few minutes passed as she read through several times, before she was almost scared out of her skin by the panel speaking again in a radically different voice.
    
    “Eh, hello? Someone trying to get in? Are you still there?”
    
    “Y-y-y-yes?”
    
    “Oh, good. I didn’t know we had anyone down here today, but I guess no one knows where everyone is with all the crazy emitter repairs, right?” The panel chuckled. “Anyway, what’s your employee number? I can get you on the list real quick.”
    
    [Euvi does not have an employee number or know what one is. What should she do?]

    <em>Scene 19</em>
    “E-Em...employee number? I don’t... what is that?”
    
    “Huh? Your employee number. You know, the thing on your ID so I can get you into the door’s database.”
    
    The panel’s speech was much faster and less precise than it had been before, and Euvi was having trouble keeping up. Still, the change sounded... “Are you a person? Like me, not like a machine?”
    
    “Uh... yes? I’m confused; are you actually an employee?”
    
    There was a pause as Euvi breathed in, so excited she almost couldn’t decide how to answer. “I live here! Do you live here too? Are you like me? Fixing things? I-” Suddenly, she cut herself off, remembering it was rude to ask too many questions at once. At least, that’s what she had read somewhere.
    
    “You live... here? Like, inside the station?”
    
    For the second time in less than a minute, Euvi was almost floored by excitement. “You <em>don’t</em>?! From the outside?! What is it like; what do you do? Can I go? Wh-” <em>Not all at once!</em>
    
    The panel was silent for several seconds. Euvi vibrated with impatience.
    
    Finally, it responded again. “I’m going to get my supervisor, okay? Can you stay right here for another few minutes?”
    
    “Stay here!” Euvi repeated, planting her shoes firmly on the floor. “And then you can tell me about the outside?”
    
    “Yes; just a minute.”
    
    ...
    
    Gim Owen, floor supervisor for interior operators in Amira Station, was not currently a happy man.
    
    He normally was - his standard disposition was downright jovial according to many of his colleagues - but today was a bit of an outlier. Today - just a few minutes ago, in fact - he had been informed that Amira Station was doomed along with the rest of the Sibdael system. The star they had all spent hundreds of years containing was about to break out and annihilate everything for light years around in only a matter of days. And not only was he supposed to deal with that news, but he was also supposed to keep it secret from his team for the rest of the day.

    “Gim! Gim! I need your help; can you come over here?”
    
    Gim looked up. One of his younger operators, a strange fellow made of resonant chunks of crystal pinned together with odd metal joints, was waving him over. The lad was a little excitable, but did solid enough work. Shame about the lack of facial features; apparently his species conveyed nonverbal emotion through subtle vibrations, but Gim’s translator had never been very good at picking that out. Made it harder to communicate. Good man regardless. He ambled over; a distraction would be nice.
    
    “Yes? What’s got you all riled up?”
    
    “Someone’s trying to get into an emitter, and they aren’t an employee. Says they live in the station. You think there might be a... stowaway or something? I don’t know how they’d get any food down there if they’re an organic species, though...”
    
    Gim paused, concerned. He knew about the ghosts, but none of his operators were supposed to. For the most part, they just worked unseen and unheard. “I’ll take over here,” he said, sliding into the crystal fellow’s chair. “Go take a break for a while, why don’t you?”
    
    After the operator had departed, Gim settled down and toggled the microphone. “Hello? Are you still there?”
    
    A response came back quickly. “Yes! I am here!” A little distorted, but clearly intelligible and very excited. <em>I didn’t know the ghosts could speak with emotion like that, actually. Sem told me they were almost like organic robots. Mindless.</em>
    
    “What’s your name, lass?”
    
    “Euvi!” She paused only a moment before continuing. “Do you have a name? Are you from the outside? Please tell me what it is!”
    
    “Patience, Euvi. We’ll get there. I’m Gim, and right now I need to know why you’re trying to get into the emitter room.”
    
    “Gim! The task said to go in and fix it!” Thankfully, she had apparently learned some restraint and didn’t append another set of questions to her response.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1056603121381544056 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1056603121381544056><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="25-Dec-22 11:03 AM">11:03</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“The task... Well then.” Gim tapped at his tablet; the crystal fellow’s workstation didn’t have access to the task scheduling system. “Let me take a look. Please wait there another few minutes, okay?”
    
    “Okay!!”
    
    Gim hummed tunelessly as he poked through menus, picking apart strands of active tasks for the millions of ghosts. Emitter 04-18 did indeed have a task assigned, though the ghost’s designation obviously wasn’t “Euvi.” She wouldn’t know her own number, of course. <em>In fact, it’s a little strange she has a name at all. Who gave it to her? Or did she just make it up?</em> He shook his head, confused and a little unsettled. “Alright, who assigned this... autogenerated? Really!”
    
    The station’s AI generated and assigned almost all of the millions of active tasks per day, for obvious quantity-related reasons. But a handful were assigned by professional staff to target specific known issues the station either wasn’t aware of or didn’t prioritize. The strangeness of this task’s description - and location, since ghosts were never allowed into the emitters - made him think someone had screwed up. But if it was the station itself...? The AI wasn’t actually sentient, but it could do a good job of fooling the average layperson at times. If it thought the ghost could work on the emitter, who was he to argue? He didn’t need higher approval to confirm an automatic task, so he could theoretically just override the door and let her in.
    
    But, of course, now this little ghost knew about the outside. Sem had told him that ghosts could get unpredictable and violent if they were confronted with anything beyond their own little world of tasks and repairs. He had been instructed to terminate any ghosts who saw something that might turn them into a threat. After all, they had millions of the things and it wasn’t like they were <em>people.</em> Disposable.
    
    ... Right?

    <em>Scene 20</em>
    “I’ll let you into the emitter. Your task looks correct, so I hope you can figure out what’s wrong with it. Strange times... Okay, the door should recognize your hand now. Try it again.”
    
    A delay, then Gim saw a little indicator light up as the door’s state toggled open. “It is open!” the little ghost reported.
    
    “Great; well, good luck. I’ll be going now...” Gim reached for the toggle that would close the connection, but he was interrupted before he could get there.
    
    “Wait! You said you would tell me the outside! What is it?!”
    
    <em>So excited. Are they all like this?</em> He almost closed the connection anyway, but something held him back. Maybe it was her tone of voice, maybe it was the recent knowledge of the looming detonation, or maybe it was the building realization that Sem had probably been lying to him. “... Do you know what a sun is?” he found himself asking.
    
    “A sun? Like a star, or like a man?”
    
    “Like a star.” <em>What language is she speaking that she got those confused? Or does she just not know the definition properly?</em> Gim scratched at the fur just below his mass of facial tendrils; his native language didn’t have homonyms like that. He’d check his translator later to see what he had been speaking. Good thing he had the implanted version, or he wouldn’t have been able to communicate with her at all.
    
    “I know about stars! Big, hot things that make light. Is that what the outside is?”
    
    “... Sort of. You can see for yourself in the emitter housing. But the station you’re inside - Amira Station - its job is to keep a star alive.”
    
    “Keep a star alive...”
    
    “If the station ever fails, the star will explode and destroy the station and everyone nearby.”
    
    “...Everyone?”
    
    “Billions and billions of people.”
    
    “...”

    “So many. How do you all-” she cut herself off. “Can I go there?”
    
    <em>Hell with it.</em> “Maybe if both of us are still alive in a month.” <em>Only if she presses.</em>
    
    She pressed. “Still alive? Is it the star?”
    
    <em>Perceptive, and capable of putting together abstract relationships. This isn’t some mindless organic robot; this is a person. Sem lied. We... we’re slavers, aren’t we?</em> “The station is failing. The star will explode within a week, we think, and there’s nothing we can do about it besides keep up with current repairs. That’s the only thing you can do, too, to try and make it last as long as possible.”
    
    “A week...?” The ghost paused for a few moments, as if working through the information. “Am I everyone?”
    
    He frowned, then his translator spit out a better guess at her meaning. “Yes, you are part of everyone. You, me, everyone else. All dead in a week.” <em>I should have stopped talking a while ago. Now she’s going to stop working since there’s no point anyw-</em>
    
    “How can I fix it? I am good at fixing things; I can fix the station!”
    
    <em>Still optimistic, too? Just who is this lass?</em> “Start with that emitter. If you can fix that one, we might have a little more time to figure out something else.”
    
    “I will fix this! And then I will see outside!”

He had thought it was bad enough that a large portion of the station’s actual maintenance staff would die in the supernova, but now it seemed millions of ghosts down below were real people too. He shook his head. No worse than the billions of innocents marked for death on the Sibdael system’s planets. Still, he’d keep an eye on this particular little ghost.
    
    ...
    
    Euvi stared.
    
    The emitter itself was a massive, building-sized monolith of metal and ceramic, towering hundreds of feet over the enormous hangar-like space. But she had seen big machines before; the station itself was nothing if not a constant parade of titanic mechanisms. No, the real reason she stared, craning her neck to see better, was that the ceiling beyond the great curve was just... not there.
    
    The emitter’s spire reached through a circular hole in the station’s mass, punching out into empty space. A shimmering barrier of transparent force was visible around the edges of the hole, but beyond that was... fire. A burning-bright wall of red-orange-yellow stretched unbroken from horizon to horizon, roaring and howling and spraying bursts of flaming plasma in every direction. Thick lines of blue-white force were visible criss-crossing the star, and it seemed calmer near those, but many of the lines were weak, broken, or missing.

The outside. Finally, her temperature regulator beeped a warning about “excessive radiation” and ordered her to take shelter. Euvi hustled across the massive hangar to the base of the emitter spire, where she no longer had a direct view of the star. The regulator calmed down, as did the little green canister she had found in the previous room and connected to the main device. Apparently there was no air in here, so that canister let her breathe. Similarly, the heavy goggles let her safely view the star from this distance.
    
    “I understand,” she whispered. The person behind the panel had told her many frightening (but exciting!) things about the station, her role, and the outside. But the danger of the star hadn’t sunk in until she had actually seen it for herself.
    
    This monster, Euvi thought, <em>could</em> kill billions. Herself included.
    
    And that meant she had to do her very best to fix this emitter and save everyone. Or, if she couldn’t, she had to get out. Euvi had carefully noted what the panel-man had said about “everyone <em>nearby.</em>” The station was nearby, but the outside was big. It had to be, or he wouldn’t have used the word. If Euvi couldn’t fix the station, she had to get out and go far away. The panel-man seemed resigned to his fate, but Euvi absolutely did not intend to die.
    
    She peeked out from around the emitter spire again, facing down the sun, and stuck her tongue out at it. “I will win,” she told the star. “You will not kill me.”
    
    But, of course, fixing the station would be a better outcome because that would save <em>everyone.</em> So it was time to get to work. Euvi found a door in the side of the emitter spire, hoisted her tool bag, and slipped inside.

    The freighter’s captain raised his eyes away from the windows, focusing on the woman speaking to him. The ship’s pilot, Daya.
    
    “The launches. Look.”
    
    He moved over to allow Daya to step down into the little divot next to him and peer towards the planet’s surface far below. Tiny flashes of light revealed hundreds of starships burning away from every operational spaceport all at the same time. From the navigation console above them, hundreds of little blips vanished one after another as ships disappeared into hyperspace.
    
    “They must have finally announced the situation. How many do you think will return?” he asked quietly.
    
    Daya stared at the disappearing twinkles as launches continued. “I can’t imagine many will. If they come back and land, they’re asking to be mobbed by desperate people who just want to escape.”
    
    The captain nodded slowly. “Have you seen any of the people boarding with us? Spoken to them?”
    
    “No. Tellin said to stay in the crew section in case anything got violent. He didn’t want to risk me.”
    
    “And are you Tellin’s property? Are you worried that some of these scared, desperate people will attack you?”
    
    “I... don’t know.” Daya looked troubled, doubt clouding her pale grey eyes.
    
    The captain felt that little buildup of static electricity that always happened when she got like this, and tapped her arm to dispel it. A spark flashed and they both jumped. “You were doing it again,” he said. “Follow me; we need to settle that uncertainty of yours.”
    
    Flustered, Daya followed. “Sorry; I can’t believe it happened again. I don’t know why - I mean, there’s nothing that should...” She trailed off as the captain smiled pleasantly. “You really think it’s...?”
    
    “Eyes like stormclouds,” he said, waving in the vague direction of her face. “Hair like thunder. Daughter of the tempest, you are.”

What does thunder look like? It’s just a sound.”
    
    “Ah, if we knew, it wouldn’t be so mysterious, would it? Stories filter through from the old days; everyone agrees the ancient blood is so much more diluted now. Maybe you don’t have the hair, or maybe thunder can look like many things. But the offer is still open, if you ever want to find out.”
    
    “... You really think your shamans can do a better job of understanding what’s wrong with me than modern medicine?”
    
    “Well, there’s no harm in at least finding out, right? Worst that can happen is you don’t learn anything.”
    
    “Tell me about it again, after all this. Okay?”
    
    The captain nodded. “You might be surprised at the value of a good legend. Anyway, we’re here. Ready?”
    
    “... Ready.”
    
    The captain smiled knowingly as he slid open the door and entered the main body of the ship. Daya was still nervous; he could feel the electric charge again on his hair and skin as she walked next to him. Ah, daughter of the tempest indeed. She reminded him of his grandson, the one who had stayed on Ovanox as a farmer. Maybe he should introduce them, if she ever accepted his offer to learn.
    
    He tapped her arm again to release the charge, shocking them both for a second time. “Peace,” he instructed. “Tellin is overly protective. These people won’t hurt you.”
    
    “I know; it’s just...”
    
    He waited patiently.
    
    “Okay, I don’t know. But I’ll try.”
    
    The captain nodded. Good enough for him.
    
    They spent almost half an hour there. The captain helped direct traffic, answer questions, reassure people, and just generally let himself be seen. People responded to his uniform, his authority, and his calm, pleasant manner; they wanted to believe that their captain was caring and competent. He let them see that it was true.

Still, he saw her start to relax; the static electricity receded.
    
    One of his other officers approached with a report. The captain stepped back to receive it, leaving Daya to continue her work directing groups to balance the various cargo holds. “How are we doing?” he asked.
    
    “This is the last shuttle,” the officer stated briskly. “We’ve taken on slightly over 50,000 passengers and enough rations to sustain them for the full-day jump over to our destination. That’s about all we could fit into the holds without risking crushing someone; people don’t stack nearly as well as containers, sir.”
    
    “Good; good. More than I thought would fit, at least. Medical and hygiene?”
    
    “I’ll be honest, sir, those are not looking nearly as good. Stel and Mavis jerry-rigged some extra toilets in the side airlocks, but that’s not going to do much more than get the waste jettisoned into space. We have some medical staff and supplies among the refugees, but nothing beyond the basics for treatment. No bunks or anything, as you might expect; it’s going to be very uncomfortable for everyone.”
    
    “But they’ll live.”
    
    “But they’ll live, sir.”
    
    “That will have to do. I want us back here for another group in less than three days, so let’s make sure we move as efficiently as possible. Won’t leave much time for refueling.”
    
    Daya returned at this point, smiling slightly as a little toddler waved at her from the latest group of refugees. “I can see the end of the line,” she said, gesturing to the airlock. “Time for me to get us ready to fly?”
    
    “Full burn, if you please,” the captain instructed. “No restrictions; just as fast as you can make this old tub go.”
    
    She grinned. “<em>That</em>, I can do.”

    <em>Scene 22</em>
    A man stood alone in a sea of pushing, shouting bodies, surrounded by more people than he had ever seen together in his life. The air was warm and heavy, the spaceport’s ventilation systems working overtime to account for the enormous over-occupancy. An announcement crackled over the PA system, but he couldn’t hear it over the general din.
    
    The man peered ahead, trying to catch a glimpse of the gate that he was theoretically in line for. He was tall enough to see the sign: C-19 glowed blue and calm over the chaos. Unfortunately, he couldn’t see the door, the front of the line, or the staff who would be trying to maintain order as best they could.
    
    He had been here, in the capital’s (and planet’s) largest spaceport, for nearly a full day now. Shuttles had come and gone, ferrying those at the front of the lines into orbit. Smaller craft had landed directly and lifted thousands of people away from the planet. One particularly overloaded starship had taken on too many passengers, tried to take off anyway, and clipped a building past the end of the runway while still trying to gain height. The resulting fireball had killed thousands, but the port hadn’t stopped evacuations or even temporarily closed the runway. The only thing that mattered right now was getting as many people away from the star as possible.
    
    The man shuffled forwards, locating the guideposts between bodies that told him he was still in the correct line. It had taken him nearly sixteen hours of waiting by the check-in desks before he had managed to get assigned a gate in the “secured” zone - although no one was operating the security checkpoints anymore - and then another five of standing or sitting in the line itself. He had walked the length of the spaceport at this point and was finally within sight of salvation. Another few shuttles and he could get out.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1058851944405405706 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1058851944405405706><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="31-Dec-22 03:59 PM">15:59</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The man waited with a sense of resigned detachment. He couldn’t leave the line to get anything, so he simply sat down and shuffled forwards whenever the people in front of him stood up. Occasionally he would have to stand even if the line wasn’t moving, just to avoid getting stepped on by someone else.
    
    Time passed. The line wound forwards. Starships were visible through the enormous windows; it was well after dark now, but the port couldn’t close. In a moment of vague lucidity, the man wondered about the staff coordinating the movements of all the starships on the ground. How tired must they be at this point, huddled invisibly up in their towers and hyper-aware that a single slowdown in one ship’s turnaround could mean a difference of thousands of lives?
    
    Finally, he could see the gate itself. A single dull metal door, guarded by three exhausted-looking people in spaceport staff uniforms. Two held stun batons wardingly as the crowd pressed close, while the third drowsily worked at a computer just before the door. The man blinked several times, as if coming awake from a deep sleep. He was very thirsty; he had been ignoring that for quite some time.
    
    The person at the computer nodded to one of the stun baton people, who glanced at the computer. The door was opened and the staff moved slightly aside, shouting to form an orderly, single-file line for the shuttle.
    
    One person shoved their way out of place, scrambling through the line to the front. That was all it took.
    
    The spaceport staff shouted as the entire line surged forwards, everyone frantically trying to get ahead of everyone else, or pushed forwards by the wave of people behind them trying to do just that. Someone screamed; the man couldn’t tell what had happened. He was buffeted by people from every direction, disoriented and shoved inexorably towards the doorway.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1058852010939666482 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1058852010939666482><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="31-Dec-22 03:59 PM">15:59</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Several loud <em>cracks</em> echoed along with bursts of bright light, but the stun batons quickly fell silent. The man couldn’t see any of the staff anymore; he couldn’t see anything beyond the tight-pressed clothes and bodies of the people around him.
    
    He was swept up in the wave and shoved through the door. Running now, he could barely keep himself ahead of the trampling crush as the crowd thundered down the jetbridge and spilled onto the waiting starship. Someone - possibly a member of the ship’s crew - yelled to slow down, but the momentum of the crowd could not be slowed even by the crowd itself.
    
    Minutes later, the man found himself pressed against a curving wall on one side and a mass of bodies on the other. People shouted from the other end of the starship, yelling about takeoff weight and trying to physically haul people back into the spaceport. The man was far enough back that he couldn’t have gotten out even if he wanted to.
    
    Someone was crying nearby. The man couldn’t tell who, but it sounded like a child. Other refugees shuffled, pulling slightly farther apart as more people were removed from the craft. The man could see now: a small child with brown hair and a bloody nose. No more than six or seven years old, short enough to be shoved around by adults’ stomachs. They sniffled quietly in the ship, staring around with wide eyes. The man couldn’t see anyone who looked responsible for the child.
    
    He tried to push through the crowd, but just couldn’t squeeze out of his spot. Before long, the crowd had rearranged enough that the child disappeared back into the press.
    
    Minutes later, the doors shut and the starship lifted off. The man could feel its engines straining against all the extra load, but they made it into the air, then space, then the purple-streaked blackness of hyperspace. He had no idea where they were going or what would await them there; just that it was away from the sun.

    The man did not sleep well that night, despite his exhaustion.

    <em>Scene 23</em>
    Euvi disentangled herself from the mess of wiring and tiny electrical components, maneuvering carefully to avoid popping anything out of place. She heaved up the slablike metal hatch that provided access to the cable duct, glancing to the sides to make sure no wires would get cut in half, then slowly eased it closed and turned to watch the diagnostic panel set into the wall. It blanked for several seconds, running its automated tests, then finally settled back into a stable, happy state.
    
    “Haaaah,” Euvi sighed, tracking down her water bottle and taking a long drink. She had been working on the spire’s internals for hours and hours, hustling back and forth to the drop points initially, but then just worming her way through wiring ducts to make use of the spare parts she had picked up. It was a good thing she wasn’t particularly large. But finally, the topmost level of the spire was happy as well. It was time to turn the whole thing back on.
    
    She spent a few more minutes just resting first, appreciating the sheer complexity of the gigantic machine she sat within. The emitter spire seemed to use vast amounts of electrical energy on some sort of magnetic containment of... something? And then there was the big central barrel that carried this something and focused it up through the emitter’s firing array at the very top. Euvi didn’t grasp the specifics, but she got the gist of it: this was a giant cannon that fired a continuous, extremely precise, devastatingly high-energy beam at the star.
    
    Certainly a far cry from the leaky water pipe of just a few days ago. Well, time to go make sure it worked.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1059554872330031234 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1059554872330031234><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-Jan-23 02:32 PM">14:32</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She clambered down the ladder towards the spire’s base, picking up her tablet from the side of the room as she went. She hadn’t needed it recently; the last hour or so had been simple enough with the aid of the spire’s own diagnostics. Each level looked good as she passed; all cleaned up and put back together correctly. All the diagnostic panels looked happy. Sure, Euvi could have saved some time by not cleaning up - the panel-man Gim seemed to think this spire wouldn’t last much longer than a week anyway - but she wouldn’t stand for leaving a job half-done, or even 90% done. Besides, what if something didn’t work and she had just left all the cables in a pile? It would be a nightmare to try and dig them out again. No, much better to take the time to clean up properly.
    
    Euvi hustled across the giant hangar to stand near the entrance door, where the manual disconnect was located. The acoustics in the space were still odd to her; she could hear her footsteps, but the sound cut off unnaturally quickly and everything else was silent aside from her own movements. Something to do with the lack of air, she surmised, but how exactly that worked wasn’t entirely clear. Even her tablet couldn’t make any noise unless it was pressed up against her body; holding it normally wasn’t enough, let alone leaving it elsewhere in the room. She had missed a few alerts for parts arriving due to that.
    
    “Okay,” she whispered, even though the emitter couldn’t hear her from there. “You will be alive again.”
    
    The breaker slid down with a satisfying <em>klunk</em>. Red lights whirled around the base of the emitter and all its doors closed; Euvi knew it was now scanning for anyone left inside the spire. That check passed, the red lights went out and the floor shuddered. Little rings of soft white light glowed around its base. Those rings weren’t actually lights; they were glass windows into some sort of tubing below the spire.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1059554941066293269 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1059554941066293269><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="02-Jan-23 02:33 PM">14:33</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Several indicators blinked in sequence on the control panel next to the disconnect, then the main status light finally switched from red to amber. “Yessss,” Euvi breathed, patting the light. “You can do it.”
    
    Minutes passed as the spire warmed up; Euvi watched the ring lights grow brighter and different indicators flash on and off with only minimal warnings. Finally, the main status light switched from amber to a pleasing teal blue. “Blue: Idle-Ready,” she read from the manual, swiping away an annoying notification on her tablet. “To engage, rotate the mode selector to ‘Full.’”
    
    “Full,” she repeated, quickly locating the second-largest control on the other side of the panel from the disconnect. “Full.” She moved it over to the appropriate setting with another satisfying <em>click</em>.
    
    The emitter exploded.
    
    Euvi cried out and staggered with the shockwave, barely keeping her feet by bouncing off the wall. She blinked rapidly, trying to clear her vision to make out how bad it was and what had gone wrong, but then slowed down as it became clear that nothing <em>had</em> gone wrong.
    
    The emitter spire glowed strongly from heat fins and pipes along its surface, radiating such strong energy it was almost as hard to look at as the star itself. From its tip, a brilliant white-blue beam poured forth into space, filling nearly the entire aperture and hiding the sun completely with its white-out glow. The main status light was green.
    
    Rattled by the shockwave and alerted of “excessive radiation” by the thermal regulator again, Euvi slipped back into the airlock and quickly returned to the station proper. Full of pride and ready to tell the panel-man what had happened, she stepped out of the emitter housing... and immediately noticed that all the lights were off.

Did I...?” She fumbled for her tablet, then finally noticed the several alerts she had ignored in her excitement to turn the emitter back on - and had initially missed due to the vacuum deadening the tablet’s speakers: “End of cycle. Return to compartment.”
    
    Satisfaction morphed into anxiety. She had been out <em>two hours</em> beyond the end of the cycle, and was at least another hour from her compartment at a normal pace. This wouldn’t be a quick “twenty minute” walk like last time when she had run into that cleaning robot; this would take many times longer. Plus, it was now <em>way</em> past the end of the cycle. If anything more dangerous roamed at night, it would have had plenty of time to emerge by now.
    
    “...” Euvi pressed her hand against the panel - perhaps to get back into the emitter airlock; perhaps to talk to panel-man - but it only beeped harshly. “Unauthorized post-cycle access attempt. Remain stationary for automated response.”
    
    She stumbled back, glancing into the cavernous hallway in the dark. “A-automated response?”
    
    In the distance, audible above the constant groaning from the walls, a screeching saw-like whir ground into life. The second Thing she had managed to avoid last time. Euvi jumped into action, dashing away from the panel by instinct. What should she do?

    <em>Scene 24</em>
    She ran for it. <em>Just get away before that thing can get here!</em>
    
    Blessedly, the hallways near the emitter spires were much larger than the more cramped confines deeper in the station, so Euvi had little trouble running at near-full speed with the tablet held before her to warn of any approaching walls. The harsh, sawblade-like noise screeched closer, then passed by at a distance, continuing towards where she had been previously. No time to stop just yet; she kept going.
    
    After at least a quarter-hour of running, Euvi slowed down and tried to quiet her breathing, listening. Nothing that she could hear over the station’s general groaning. She flipped the tablet back around and picked the nearest drop point to route to - there was no <em>way</em> she was going to keep wandering around in the dark for hours trying to make it back to her compartment. Not with things that sounded like that on the prowl.
    
    Almost forty minutes after she had stepped out of the emitter housing, Euvi located a drop point and slipped inside, closing the door and blocking it with a large empty capsule. Still paranoid that she could maybe hear the faintest hint of screeching saws through the walls, she then stepped into the smaller bathroom compartment and closed that door too, blocking this one with her body.
    
    Finally, Euvi settled down on the floor and curled into a ball, shaking. “I am okay, right?” she asked the sink. “I will just wait here and go back in the morning when those things are not there.”
    
    “...”
    
    “Yes, I do not know what happens if I am not in my compartment overnight. Maybe it will not notice? Maybe I can ask panel-man Gim?”
    
    “...”
    
    “Ssh!” Euvi ordered the sink, pressing herself into a tighter ball. Sawblades screeched in the distance, this time <em>definitely</em> audible over the groaning walls.
    
    Minutes passed. The sound faded. Euvi tried to relax on the warm, hard floor, and eventually drifted off into a fitful sleep.

She was still in the drop point bathroom, sore and tired from sleeping on the floor but otherwise okay. The “thunk” had been the automatic lights clicking on, signaling the arrival of the new cycle.
    
    She sat up and stretched, rubbing her neck painfully, then stood. She didn’t have any food, but at least there was plenty of water from the sink. And hopefully she’d be getting back to her compartment before too long; there would be food from yesterday’s tasks.
    
    After returning to the main drop point chamber, moving the capsule away from the door, and peeking outside just to make sure nothing was moving (all clear), Euvi opened the map to find a route back home.
    
    “...”
    
    The tablet displayed a dull grey exclamation mark with the error message “Map expired - refresh at your terminal!” Nothing else.
    
    “B-but... there was... yesterday, give it back? Please?” She spent several minutes wrestling with the tablet’s settings, trying to make it return the map she had just used yesterday - it should still show the same area - but the app simply refused. She couldn’t get a live map or even a static image of yesterday’s. Nothing.
    
    Almost lightheaded with shock and fear, Euvi slowly slid down the wall and dropped her tablet unceremoniously. No map. She had run a long way last night in the dark, taking turns nearly at random to throw off the buzzsaw thing. She was still over an hour from her compartment - assuming it was even still there! And the station’s corridors were so complex in three dimensional space that there was no guarantee she would ever be able to find her way back to the emitter, another drop point, or... well, anything.

    She fell onto her back, letting air leak from her mouth in a strangled squeak. Utterly lost, no food, no way to get help, and the only thing keeping her from baking alive in the heat was running out of batteries.
    
    This, to put it lightly, was not good.
    
    [At least one option is potentially deadly to Euvi.]

    “...”
    
    Well, there was nothing for it but to try and find her way back to the emitter spire; once there, she could talk to panel-man again and ask him for help. Going back to her compartment might be a better result overall, but she had little to no hope of ever finding it, even if it were still in the same place. The emitter spire, meanwhile, was near the edge of the station and had red walls nearby with white lines, unlike anywhere else she had been. Plus, it was closer. It would be easier and faster to find.
    
    At least, if the thermal regulator lasted until then. She reached down to poke at it, but the screen was small and didn’t display any precise battery statistics; it just had a simple three-segment display with the last segment blinking slowly. How long had it taken her to drain the first two? Two days? So she should have the rest of the day at least...
    
    Euvi knew perfectly well how much it was asking for any machine’s indicator to deplete at a steady rate. She couldn’t rely on it. So, time to get moving.
    
    She refilled her water at the sink, kicked the empty capsule again as it had rolled back to block the door, and determinedly set off into the maze.
    
    ...
    
    Gim Owen, floor supervisor for interior operators in Amira Station, was even less happy than he had been yesterday. He had broken the news to his team this morning in an all-hands meeting, unable to answer many of their questions without guidance from the missing executive staff. He had spent an hour trying to calm people down and explain the critical importance of their work over the next few days, additionally buoying their morale by offering guaranteed evacuation for all Amira Station staff who stayed until the end. That last part, at least, had been arranged by the Federation officer and Jin La’Rojin, of all people. Gim supposed that La’Rojin was probably the highest-ranking person still left on the station, and didn’t let that worry him as much as it could have.

He made sure to do several rounds in the morning, talking to everyone one-on-one and trying to ensure no one was <em>too</em> upset.
    
    Well, he supposed you couldn’t really be <em>too</em> upset about the imminent destruction of your entire solar system. But he at least tried to make sure everyone could at least function.
    
    Anyway, after all that, he finally had some time to sit down around lunch and remember that he had meant to check on the emitter that the little ghost had been fixing yesterday. No one had mentioned anything about her today, which... well, he wasn’t sure what to think about that. He tapped through various reports from the station’s internals as he heated up a curry, skimming until he reached the emitter arrays.
    
    “Hmm mmm hmmmm; 04... dmm huhhh laaa... 18. Oh? Very good job, little ghost!” The readings all showed clear, and they had been going strong since relatively late last night when the spire had most recently been powered on. “That might buy us a little more time; I didn’t think you had it in you.”
    
    Glancing occasionally at his lunch spinning as it heated up, Gim entered in the ghost’s ID number, wondering if the station had assigned her another emitter to repair. Maybe she could work through the 04 block, freeing up actual maintenance staff for their many, many other critical duties.
    
    “Hm! Not checked in? Missing, are you?” None of the station’s sensors had picked up the ghost’s ID since she had failed to get back into the emitter spire just after repairing it last night. “Automated response dispatched...? What could that mean? Well, it would probably say if it had actually done anything.” There was another task assigned to investigate and repair emitter 04-25 today, but the station noted that no equipment had been retrieved and no acceptance had been registered.

Nothing had seen her; the door to 04-18 hadn’t opened recently either, which was realistically his only other idea on where to find her.
    
    “Well, that sure is strange.” He closed out of the system, switching over to a different overview of his team’s activity. Several issues had already been elevated while he was messing around trying to find the ghost. “I don’t suppose I can rightly do anything about it, though. Hope you’re okay, little lass.”
    
    ...
    
    “Go to hell, Zaes,” Ellie said as the call connected. That was one of her default greetings for the scientist with ghost-white hair. He never seemed offended by it. “What do you want this time?”
    
    “Good evening, Ms Lynran. Is Ms Alborn here?”
    
    “No; she’s busy. You have to deal with me this time.” Truthfully, Mel was “here” - there wasn’t really any way for her to <em>not</em> be here when they lived on the same starship - but she was in the shower. Ellie didn’t respect Zaes enough to tell him to call back later, though. He would have to talk to her; he was usually in a hurry.
    
    “Ah, a true tragedy. Your partner is so much more pleasant to work with than you are.”
    
    “And I’m damn proud of her patience. Now get on with it.”
    
    Zaes shuffled a handful of papers - <em>papers?</em> In <em>this</em> century? - and picked one out of the pile. “I have a job for you. Urgent; you would only have a few days at the most. Are you anywhere near the Sibdael system?”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1061099072540377088 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1061099072540377088><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="06-Jan-23 08:48 PM">20:48</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Ellie sighed and checked the charts. She’d lie to him, but Mel would get upset and there wasn’t <em>really</em> a point. Zaes had originally “hired” them by essentially blackmailing and threatening them a little over a year ago. After several missions for him, however, he apparently considered their debt paid for his “favor” of letting them go, and started actually paying them for their work. None of the things he asked them to do were realistically much worse than the other contracts they tended to pick up, so at Mel’s urging, Ellie had begrudgingly agreed to treat him like any other client.
    
    Of course, that didn’t mean she had to be polite. <em>Mel</em> was the polite one in their duo; that was part of their charm. Anyway. “Two days out, more or less. Is this about the supernova?”
    
    “News travels fast out there, I see.”
    
    “Mel’s got people on the inside; you should know that by now. Real shame, how many folks are going to die there.”
    
    “I agree. Lockheed-Bolte has agreed to dispatch one of its cruisers that happens to be in the area to assist with humanitarian aid. I will, coincidentally, be on that ship.”
    
    “Some coincidence,” Ellie grumbled, but internally she was curious. Zaes was notoriously difficult to get ahold of in person; she hadn’t met with him a single time after their first interaction.
    
    “Indeed. You will arrive in the system before us, and you will navigate to the coordinates I will send you on Sibdael II. There, you will meet with and pick up our mutual informant, who we have promised safe evacuation from the system in exchange for his assistance.”
    
    “And he will be informing us to...?”
    
    “Help you sneak aboard Amira Station and steal a very particular set of research data, which you will then deliver to me directly.”

    “That’s correct. You will, of course, be well compensated for your efforts. And I assure you, my research is of critical concern to the greater galaxy. You will have a chance to examine part of it when we meet, should you wish.”
    
    Ellie blinked, then squinted. “You’re being surprisingly accommodating. What’s your game, Zaes?”
    
    “Survival.”
    
    She met his eyes and frowned. He meant it.
    
    “... Alright, I’ll talk with Mel and we’ll get back to you in half an hour. Consider the job provisionally accepted; send us the pay info and other details.”
    
    “Of course. I look forward to our meeting, hunter.”

    Valeria Nomano stood on the crowded train, grasping her bag with one hand and an overhead handle with the other. Occasionally, one of her legs would twitch and threaten to topple her to the ground, but her grip on the handle was strong enough to stay upright despite that. Still, when a smartly-dressed man noticed her struggle and stood to offer his seat a minute into the ride, she accepted it gratefully. Pride was one thing, but practicality was another.
    
    Both of Val’s legs were cyberware from thigh to toe, her organic ones having been destroyed in a terrible accident during her Federation cadet days. Ordinarily, that wouldn’t be a problem - cybernetic legs could often be even <em>better</em> than the real thing - but in her specific case, there had also been some neurological trauma from the explosion that prevented her motor nerves from working quite correctly. Doctors and engineers alike had failed to solve the problem entirely, so here she was with legs that worked fine in theory but wobbled or spasmed when paired when her damaged brain.
    
    This was, of course, why she couldn’t be a field agent like Ifan. He had been present at the time and often blamed himself for Val’s situation. On some particularly bad days she did too, but most of the time she was just grateful that she could walk at all.
    
    The train cheerfully announced her stop and Val disembarked, nodding again to the man who had stood up for her. Walking could be an issue, but most days it wasn’t too bad once she got moving and had her cane for support. Today, she didn’t have far to go; the Senate Committees building was right next to the train station for the convenience of all the senators who used it.

The sharp-edged cylinder of the Galactic Senate building of course dominated the city, but hundreds of other skyscrapers reached absurd heights so corporations and government officials alike could stay within easy reach of the galaxy’s center of power. It had gotten to the point where construction was underway on additional suspended maglev train routes half a mile above the ground, just so people on the upper floors of buildings didn’t have to clog the elevators to get around.
    
    Tiny gravlift craft - the size of large cars or busses - darted between buildings as well, but the practice was getting increasingly dangerous as traffic grew tighter and regulations failed to keep up. Val knew a number of bills had been drafted to consider banning personal gravlifts entirely, but had failed to reach broad enough support even after a string of fiery crashes left a system senator and dozens of civilians dead. Plus, banning gravlifts would put even more strain on the city’s already-overburdened transit system.
    
    Val wasn’t a senator, but she was one of the Federation liaisons to the Senate. She had to keep up with this sort of thing. At least she didn’t have to come up with a better plan to help people get around Veox Astra; it was a difficult problem.
    
    The Senate Committees building was moderately larger than the Galactic Senate building itself, and was where much of the actual work of legislating was done. Getting anything accomplished other than voting in a full session of the Senate was difficult, given the several thousand system senators and several hundred sector representatives, so committees and subcommittees were the order of the day to actually draft, debate, and submit bills.

If she couldn’t get that bill passed, the Federation would have to vastly cut back its aid since it wouldn’t be able to pay for most of it.
    
    She found herself smiling in a grim sort of way as she piled into the elevator along with a dozen other aides. Ifan had his battles; Val had hers. Different kinds, sure, but definitely no less important.
    
    It didn’t take much longer to arrive at the room housing her subcommittee for the day. Val didn’t hesitate; she pushed open the doors and headed in to reveal around thirty senators and several aides for each, all currently listening to a pale, doughy-looking human as he explained the dire threat to the Sibdael system. Val’s entrance was noted, but it wasn’t her turn to speak yet. Instead, she settled gratefully into a seat and listened to the doughy man: Sibdael’s own system senator, Zacaginie Entrone.
    
    “... will have more information on the remaining evacuations shortly, but the latest figures indicate only a hundred million have made it out of the system so far - less than half a percent of the total population! To be frank, we <em>need</em> this funding to even support <em>current</em> efforts, let alone improve matters. This shouldn’t even be a discussion; withholding these funds forces our own Federation to condone a wholesale slaughter of billions of innocent people.”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1061703821530767410 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1061703821530767410><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="08-Jan-23 12:51 PM">12:51</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>A different senator responded after Entrone sat back down; Val couldn’t see the gauruvian’s nameplate from here and she didn’t particularly care. He spoke slowly, as if to counterbalance the sense of urgency from the last speech. “Senator Entrone, I appreciate your frankness and will lay out my concerns in a likewise manner: concerns which are shared by many members of my sector. In brief, the majority of your system government has fled the system already, bespeaking some hidden plan or dangerous corruption. Officers of our own Federation have revealed staggering sentient rights violations and appalling lack of planning in this Amira Station project - just earlier today, we received evidence of the use of <em>slavery</em> on the station.”
    
    Val jumped; she didn’t think that news had been publicized yet. Ifan had told her, but they had been waiting until after the current disaster to reveal it. <em>Essentially to prevent exactly what is happening now,</em> she thought, noting whispers break out through the room. Slavery was one of the core practices outlawed by the Federation, and one of the most serious crimes one could commit. Amira Station’s “ghosts” may have been critical in keeping the station running for centuries, but their existence was yet another enormous scandal in a system that really couldn’t take any more.
    
    “Yes, you heard me correctly; we provided further details to your aides. Regardless, the point is, Entrone, that we have absolutely no faith in your system’s government. Dispensing Federation funds to Sibdael seems to be the equivalent of throwing your wallet at a burglar; every investigation there seems to turn up further evidence of longstanding incompetence and corruption. We simply cannot condone such practices, nor risk funneling additional credits into what is clearly a criminal organization in all but name!”

The gauruvian who had spoken moved between groups, nodding and speaking with senators who were rapidly skimming through pages of evidence from Ifan’s investigations. Val herself had gotten the same evidence package from the man - apparently his name was Svenod Dmyoti and he was the system senator from Ojibisu, a coreworld system near Strillia. A powerful man, with outsized influence in the Senate due to his system’s importance. And he seemed dead-set against helping. <em>Very</em> not good.
    
    Senator Entrone sighed and sat down next to her. “Valeria, I believe? Federation liaison for this committee?”
    
    “That’s me.” She nodded grimly, gesturing to Dmyoti. “I see we have some problems.”
    
    “You could say that. You could say that indeed...”

    <em>Scene 27</em>
    “Dmyoti isn’t the only issue,” Entroke continued after a brief pause. “He wasn’t lying when he mentioned the rest of his sector; a number of other coreworld senators have given me similar responses. Sibdael has always tried to maintain its independence, and that combined with the... concerns with the system government have led to a lot of hesitation when it comes to committing further resources.”
    
    Val glanced into the crowd again, now noting a few other senators she actually did know. Anya Siyansky, for Gamma Veox itself, seemed to be arguing with one of Dmyoti’s coalition; her support, representing the planet they were all currently standing on, would be very important. Unfortunately, just a few people over was Yeven Diangora of Strillia, who was nodding along with Dmyoti himself. “The coreworlds seem to be split,” she noted. “How’s the mid-spiral?”
    
    “Mostly with us.” Entrone seemed relieved about that. “They don’t want this sort of thing happening to their own systems. Unfortunately, we need the coreworlds as well, since they have far more voting power than the mid.”
    
    Val nodded, still reading the room. Each system with an inhabited, spacefaring planet above a certain population was considered “Class 1” and got one senator to represent them. However, these senators received votes in full sessions based on their system’s population. This meant that, though the mid-spiral systems were significantly more numerous than inner-spiral and coreworlds, the inner core still held more votes due to its vastly higher population.
    
    “I’m considering trying a compromise to allay their concerns: requiring all distributed funds go only to Federation resources and staff rather than anyone in Sibdael. At least your people would be able to continue the evacuations that way.”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1062593120618946630 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1062593120618946630><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="10-Jan-23 11:45 PM">23:45</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“You don’t think we can convince Dmyoti and the others to sponsor the full version?” Unlike the full Senate, senators all got only one vote in committees, regardless of their system’s population. Since this committee had roughly equal core and mid-spiral representation, they could likely force the full version to a vote even without Dmyoti’s support. However, doing so with a bill opposed by the core would only doom it to a swift death in the full session later today.
    
    “Perhaps. He hasn’t been very receptive yet, but maybe there’s some tactic I’m not seeing. Do you have any information that could help?”
    
    Val and Entrone discussed tactics for several minutes, then distributed a few files to the assembled senators. Shortly afterwards, the break concluded and Siyanski called the meeting back to order. “Alright, everyone,” she said after the chatter died down. “We have a little under an hour to submit a bill for the session, and I for one intend to actually get it submitted. Sibdael’s civilian population is counting on us - in this very room - to get them the help they need to survive. So let’s wrap things up quickly and decide on what we’re sending to the full Senate. Senator Entrone, did you have a response to Senator Dmyoti’s concerns?”
    
    Entrone nodded and stood, glancing down to Val briefly. She gave him a thumbs up. Hopefully what they had prepared would work.
    
    “Senator Dmyoti and others who share his concerns; your apprehension is valid. We absolutely must investigate and prosecute those in the Sibdael system government who have mismanaged Amira Station for centuries and, in all likelihood, have signed the death warrants of billions of my own citizens.

Now is the time to <em>save lives.</em> Tens of billions of people in the Sibdael system are in the midst of suffering the greatest natural disaster in recent history, and we in the Federation <em>have the capability</em> to help them. Valeria here - our Federation liaison for the day - has provided you with the figures to understand where we stand with evacuations and temporary housing for evacuees. Without the passage of this bill, Federation cruisers will have to <em>turn around and leave.</em> Hundreds of millions of people will DIE without our action, right here, right now.
    
    “I understand and appreciate your caution - we are responsible for ensuring government funds will not be misused. However, there comes a time when reasonable caution gives way to bureaucratic red tape that stands in the way of accomplishing a government’s number one priority: protecting its citizens. The people of Sibdael are fathers; mothers; children. We owe it to them to protect them in every way we can. Please, support the full bill. Save the people of my home.”
    
    Entrone nodded, glancing at the speech timer to verify he had only a few seconds left. Just on time. “Thank you,” he concluded, and sat down.
    
    Whispering. Dmyoti did not stand up to respond, but Diangora did. The aging human man spoke quietly, carrying the authority of the Strillia system’s economic powerhouse - the system that many believed to be the second-most important in the galaxy just behind Gamma Veox. “I hear your pleas, and I weep for your people. Still, we must ensure we provide aid in the most effective way possible. Strillia supports your alternate draft.”
    
    That was it. He sat back down.
    
    Entrone glanced back at Val, who returned his gaze helplessly. <em>She</em> couldn’t do anything.

By the time she refocused on who was speaking, Senator Siyanski had already accepted the seconded motion and a good two-thirds of the senators in the room agreed. No further discussion would be permitted.
    
    Val waited anxiously as the assembled senators tapped at their voting devices, clicking through the three possible options: full version, alternate version, and nothing. With Diangora’s announcement, she had a feeling she already knew the result ahead of time.
    
    And when the votes were tallied, she was right. No one had voted to not submit any bill, but nineteen of the thirty senators present had agreed on the alternate draft, with the remaining eleven for the full draft. Siyansky nodded and announced the results, then rapidly adjourned the committee’s session. Clerks would quickly work to submit the revised bill to the full Senate for consideration just this afternoon. It was done. A half-victory.
    
    “I don’t feel like we won,” Val murmured to Entrone as he sat down heavily and leafed through the alternate draft, as if he didn’t already know what it contained. The funding was there for the Federation itself, but nothing would be provided to Sibdael and there were several key restrictions on paying cooperating systems for housing refugees. Val knew that, under these changes, she would lose several planets who had provisionally agreed to house refugees. She could find replacements. Hopefully.
    
    “At least it’s something,” he replied. “I was halfway worried they wouldn’t even support the alternate version. I suppose I’m glad that Diangora said what he did; it’s almost certain this one will get through the full Senate with his coalition’s support.”
    
    “People will die because of this,” Val said quietly. “I still can’t get over how far-reaching the decisions made in this room are.”

    “Thank you; I-”
    
    “Entrone!” Senator Siyanski shoved through the crowd, red hair falling loose down her back. She had served in Gamma Veox’s armed forces before turning to politics, so the rumors were that she now wore her hair long in defiance of having to cut it short for the military. Val had never had a chance to ask her if that was true. “Sorry about the rest of the core,” she said in that strangely thick accent that marked her as a native of Old Earth - a rarity, these days. “All of the Veoxes stand with you, and that includes in the full vote.”
    
    He inclined his head in respect. “Thank you, Senator. I and Sibdael alike deeply appreciate your support, and the support of the Veoxian Federation coordinators within our response.”
    
    “Mm! That’s you, is it?” Siyansky turned her gaze to Val, who half-rose to try and be respectful, but couldn’t stand quickly enough with her bad legs. “Valeria? We’ve met, haven’t we?”
    
    “Y-yes. I helped with the Ibedo... incident two months ago.”
    
    “Ah, that’s right. The one with the ‘missing’ cargoliner.” Siyansky nodded. “Keep it up. You’re still young, but you’ve got a good head for this sort of thing; you’ll go far if you keep your mind on it.” She held up her tablet and gestured to it with her other hand. “Now, I’ve got to go re-read this alternate draft and make sure I know what I’m voting for. See you - both, I assume - in an hour for the full session.”

Then again, I suppose I’ll be out of a job before the week is out, so it won’t matter to me...” Another sigh. “Well, I need to go report on the likely outcome and prepare my speech. I’ll put you on the list for Senate access if you’d like to attend. Thank you for your help, Valeria.”
    
    And then he was off, heading for the door and the elevators back down to the trains. Val sat there for a little longer, watching the remaining senators’ conversations wind down as the room slowly emptied. Dmyoti and Diangora were both still here, speaking quietly about halfway around the room. Interesting.

    <em>Scene 28</em>
    ... But not interesting enough to do anything. She sat and watched as they too wrapped up their conversation and headed for the doors. Diangora kept going, but Dmyoti stopped to glance down at Val. The gauruvian certainly was intimidating, with his scales the color of dull steel and muscular build that would tower over her even if she were standing.
    
    “You and Entrone made the right choice,” he said, still speaking relatively slowly. “We must protect the innocents we can, but there <em>is</em> more going on in Sibdael than any of us know. You are involved with the investigation there; you must know this.”
    
    It wasn’t a question, but Val answered anyway. “Yes, I’m working with If - the officer on scene there. The missing executives are a major concern; I agree.” She held back from trying to convince him of anything else; the revised bill had already been sent. Nothing more she could do at this point.
    
    “I almost guarantee there is some hidden trap here that we aren’t seeing, even with the revised bill. An entire system government doesn’t just disappear for simple embezzlement or to avoid taking responsibility for a crisis. This is a premeditated plan that has been brewing for centuries.” He paused, glancing towards the ceiling. “Tell your officer to be careful and keep a very keen eye out. I have a hunch there is more at risk than just the system’s population.”
    
    <em>What is he...?</em> “I’ll... let him know.”
    
    A nod. “Good day.” Senator Dmyoti left the room.
    
    <em>What was that about? I’m worried too, but...</em> Val struggled to her feet and made her way back to the elevators, frowning. <em>It’s almost like he’s thinking there’s some grand galactic-scale conspiracy. This is just one system with bafflingly incompetent and corrupt leadership. Right?</em>
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1063278511571349564 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1063278511571349564><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Jan-23 09:09 PM">21:09</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She spent the elevator and train rides considering it, then sent a brief message to Ifan updating him on the situation... and Dmyoti’s vague hunch. Sure, the senator hadn’t agreed with her position today, but he didn’t seem like a hateful lunatic. Maybe he actually had something. Better safe than sorry. Ifan seemed to be busy right now, as he didn’t acknowledge the message before Val had to stand up again to enter the Galactic Senate building proper.
    
    Unlike the blocky, asymmetric Senate Committees building which had grown along with the needs of the committees that used it, the Galactic Senate building was sleek, glossy, and polished. After clearing initial security, Val spotted no fewer than four cleaner bots working in the lobby alone as her shoes echoed on the spotless quartz crystal floor. Then it was on to the second security checkpoint, where she had to show two forms of ID, pass two forms of biometric identification, <em>and</em> submit to a full body scan for any sort of weaponry. All clear, of course. Val didn’t travel armed in the capital (or the capitol) - too much hassle.
    
    Finally, she was allowed to enter the main foyer, a massive circular hallway that ringed the entire building. The Senate chamber itself occupied the center of the cylinder for the first many floors, then the Sector Council chamber took up another few, and finally the rest of the building was composed of smaller offices and meeting rooms for various senators and bureaucrats. Infrastructure, service rooms, and elevators ran along the outside of the central ring, along with gravlift ports and even full starship docks for senators who were too busy to take the train with everyone else. Or those coming in from out of system; that too.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1063278579414220830 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1063278579414220830><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Jan-23 09:09 PM">21:09</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Well, she might as well go in. Security and the train had taken up a decent amount of time, and the meeting was scheduled to start in less than fifteen minutes. Val headed straight towards the nearest set of massive dark wood doors that had been relocated from Old Earth; the Senate building was full of relics from the previous seat of galactic power. Even some of the scorch marks on the wood had been preserved, though any structural damage had been repaired.
    
    Val had to let out an awed breath as she entered the Senate chamber. She had been here in person several times before, and seen it broadcast many more, but the space was still incredible to behold in person. She took it in again as she whispered “Sibdael” into her phone and watched a soft blue line fade into view in midair to direct her.
    
    The ground level of the Senate chamber was fairly ordinary: over a thousand desks ringing a central podium, all crafted from fine traditional materials. Every piece of furniture there was likely either an artifact from Old Earth or painstakingly crafted to imitate one. However, today all of those seats were empty and merely played host to a multitude of soft, twinkling lights like stars that glowed in the semidarkness.
    
    This was the original Senate chamber, used early in the Galactic Federation’s history - and even earlier by its precursor the United Human Systems. It was maintained as a relic of the past and the improvements made since, but it was far too small to host every Class 1 system in the greater galaxy today. The new Senate chamber was above.

A soft, shaky jump let her drift into the air, gently rising upwards into a sea of clustered lights. The tube was large enough to accommodate even the bulkiest of alien races and had several alternate methods of operation for individuals who were unable to jump - several senators had finally led a long-running effort to completion just a decade ago to resolve many of the chamber’s accessibility issues. This effort came right on the heels of a similar one to improve safety after a clerk had fallen out of a tube and died, so the entire chamber floor was now covered in a gravity field that reduced dangerous falls to safe speeds.
    
    Her blue line pointed forwards, so Val leaned towards it and was gently deposited on a glass bridge a hundred feet above the chamber floor. From so far up and in the general darkness of the room, the lights on the original furniture looked like little stars.
    
    The line led her along the bridge towards a cluster of lit-up pods, where she could finally make out some actual people. These were senators and aides from the same sector as Sibdael, grouped together along one branch of a massive glass tree. Hundreds of other branches - one for every sector in the galaxy - filled the rest of the room with thousands of lights like stars in the distance, representing every single Class 1 system in the galaxy. It was a gorgeous display, and only mildly horrendously expensive to build and maintain.

Additionally, each pod could connect to any other pod in the room so two senators could speak no matter the distance. It was a complicated system, but with several thousand individual senators (plus several times that of aides and clerks) spread across hundreds of sector groups, traditional seating arrangements simply wouldn’t suffice. Val knew that the whole starfield-like aesthetic of the room wasn’t <em>necessary</em>, per se, but it sure made an impression. She loved it.
    
    She met Entrone by his pod as he spoke with the senator from Otruul - one of the cone-shaped, long-lived aliens called quarites. He nodded politely and the quarite returned to their pod as Val arrived. “Welcome. You’re just early enough to watch the roll call.”
    
    Val joined him in the pod - the size of a small room, it held a desk and several chairs as well as the electronics needed to interface with the chamber’s systems - and glanced at the screen. “Full house today,” she commented.
    
    “Yes; I haven’t seen the chamber this full in quite some time.” He looked up, gazing at all the thousands of lights glowing in the chamber’s upper reaches. “I suppose today marks a very important decision. I hope my speech is up to the task.”
    
    [What complication arises?]
    ✋ - One of the other senators from the sector wants to talk with Val.
    ❗ - There’s a surprise announcement just before the vote.

    <em>Scene 29</em>
    “Zacaginie, who’s your friend? I thought you had stopped bringing aides in.”
    
    Val and Entrone both turned. The speaker was another senator from a nearby pod: a white-haired and balding man stooped with age, but whose gaze was still sharp. According to the plate on his pod, he was Ro Kimo from Osabruglis.
    
    “Ah, this is Valeria; she’s with the Federation.” Entrone glanced back to the roll call as it cleared and a hologram of Senator Siyansky - today’s chamber lead - materialized on the platform. “Excuse me; I will be needed shortly.”
    
    Kimo nodded. “May I speak with you for a moment, Miss Valeria? Away from Zacaginie so we don’t distract him?”
    
    “Sure?” Val returned to the main branch, passing by the hologram as Siyansky called the session to order, and stepped into Kimo’s pod instead. The man sat down across from her near the back and spoke more quietly so Entrone wouldn’t be able to overhear them. She noted his eyes again and how they lingered on her in a discomfiting way. Like he was searching for something.
    
    “You are involved with the investigation then, I take it.”
    
    “To an extent, yes.”
    
    “Good. My system government normally doesn’t like working with the Federation - I’m sure you know all about those types from the edge of the mid-spiral - but given recent revelations, I believe we may benefit from you knowing this.” Another searching almost-glare; was that a dot of purple light in the back of his eyes?
    
    Val tensed slightly, wary. There existed a number of optical cyberware modules that could do all sorts of things, including many as benign as simply correcting vision. Anything capable of causing actual damage would have been detected by the building’s security, but an implant didn’t have to be harmful to be dangerous. And combined with his overall demeanor...

Sounds ordinary, until I elaborate that there were upwards of fifty large craft - roughly cruiser sized - along with over a hundred smaller ships. And from our operators’ best guesses, most or all of these were warships.”
    
    “... What? You’re saying a military fleet jumped through your system?”
    
    “Precisely. And based on their jump heading, they were aiming towards Sibdael.”
    
    “And there’s no way this was just a regular Federation patrol?”
    
    “They didn’t respond to hails, and didn’t show in registered databases. No, as far as we can tell, there’s an unknown - and powerful - fleet in the sector, possibly on its way to Sibdael as we speak.”
    
    “And... You only just now thought that was worth mentioning to... <em>me?</em> Instead of, for example, the Federation officers who are actually <em>supposed</em> to be patrolling your sector?”
    
    “It’s as I said; the Osabrugli government is fairly independent. There was debate on whether to tell the Federation at all, and in fact I am going <em>against</em> their decision in telling you now. I simply believe this is too important to keep to ourselves at such a critical time.”
    
    Val glanced at Entrone, who was now speaking to the entire assembled audience. The hologram now showed him: a perfect duplicate mirroring his every action. “I need more details. What do you have?”
    
    “Certainly. Let me show you.”
    
    The greater galaxy had been generally at peace for three centuries after the end of the Great Galactic War and the Federation’s rise as <em>the</em> standardized, unified government. There had been occasional skirmishes, and many planets in the outer spiral still warred on a daily basis, but from the mid-spiral inwards, there had been no major military conflicts for centuries.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1063851698721931324 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1063851698721931324><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="14-Jan-23 11:06 AM">11:06</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>As a result, many systems had let their defense forces lapse, redirecting the money to civilian projects and relying on the Federation’s military for major defense and their local less-militarized police forces for peacekeeping. Unfortunately, the Federation also had a budget to balance, and keeping a standing military of a size capable of defending the entire galaxy was staggeringly expensive. The galactic defense budget had been cut repeatedly over the decades until now, the fleet actually had vastly fewer capital ships than there were Class 1 systems to request one.
    
    All that was to say: a rogue military force of the size Kimo described couldn’t match the full Federation fleet, but it definitely outnumbered the forces near Sbidael - particularly since most military vessels had been commandeered to use for evacuations. There were other ships in transit towards the system, of course, but most of the largest either remained in the core (too slow to arrive in time) or couldn’t be used for fighting due to carrying thousands of civilians for evacuation.
    
    Still, a significant portion of the Federation’s military was either in the Sibdael region or en route to there. A mystery fleet appearing out of nowhere - right there, right now - could be <em>anything</em> but a coincidence.
    
    Speeches went on in the background as Val reviewed Kimo’s documentation and - convinced there was at least a credible possibility - called it in to HQ. Gears began to turn and the behemoth of the Federation’s long-sidelined military began to lurch into motion. People with more experience in this sort of thing than Val would take over from there. She just needed to get ahold of Ifan.

Val returned to Entrone’s pod to watch the tally stabilize with an overwhelming 87% majority approving the bill. The session would continue with other matters from there, but Val had more important things to deal with than sitting in the chamber and watching senators debate the merits of comm buoy regulations or whatever. She bid Entrone farewell, descended in the blue-lit tube, and returned to the city to head back to her office.
    
    Too many thoughts whirled in her head, so she didn’t notice the forgettable-looking man who got onto the same train. She didn’t notice him discreetly press something against the back of her neck, disguised as a jostle in the crowd. And she didn’t notice how, after she had passed through the less-comprehensive security in the Federation building, the thing on her neck quietly woke up.
    
    But someone else did.

    <em>Scene 30</em>
    “This was <em>some</em> sabotage,” Ifan muttered quietly, taking in the destruction. He was standing - shield up and temperature regulator active - just beyond the damaged airlock for one of the station’s enormous emitter housings. The spire itself - tall as a building - was more or less still intact, though portions of it had melted or broken off to collapse into rubble by its base. The floor around the spire had erupted and the chamber was scored with blast marks on walls and ceiling. The airgate in the roof normally allowed the emitter to fire while blocking much of the sun’s harmful radiation from entering the chamber, but now its main ring was cracked in half and the housing lay bare to empty space outside.
    
    Three corpses in yellow jumpsuits had been discovered in the wreckage, but they had been removed before Ifan had arrived. All had been charred almost beyond recognition by the titanic blast when the spire had detonated. He stepped carefully a little further into the room, testing the floor. Unstable; there was probably a hollow cavity below this with additional components for the emitter. All now destroyed, no doubt.
    
    The sun blazed overhead, baking the chamber through radiation alone. Even the temperature regulator had a hard time keeping up against the bloated red giant hovering impatiently just above. It wouldn’t be safe to stay much longer, and it wasn’t like there was much to see from the scene anyway. Any evidence had been vaporized. He returned to the station’s interior along with the station staff that were escorting him.
    
    With air restored, they could actually speak to each other again. “Give me the timeline again,” Ifan requested, kneeling to examine a scorch mark from laser fire on the wall.

The emitters, thankfully, were such high value machinery that there were actually some cameras installed nearby. Ifan had already seen the footage, and he replayed it mentally as the events were recounted.
    
    First, these gunshots. Someone in a maintenance jumpsuit had approached the airlock door while staff were actively working on the emitter. Two people had emerged to retrieve replacement parts and the saboteur had fired several times, killing them both. They then used the handprint of one of the corpses to open the door.
    
    The three other actual workers had been inside the spire at that point, so no one had noticed the saboteur drop a small object into the tubes below the spire, then reactivate the emitter’s power from the controls by the door. This step involved removing a small cover from the panel and doing something with the internals before actually throwing the switch. After monitoring for a few moments, they left only a minute before the explosion destroyed the interior cameras, and the emitter itself.
    
    “Obviously this person is an internal threat,” Ifan stated, standing up. “They were able to acquire a maintenance jumpsuit, they knew internal protocols, and they were even able to bypass the automatic check for life signs before reactivating the spire. Is it possible this person is an actual maintenance worker? Is anyone unaccounted for?”
    
    “Er, several, unfortunately.” The supervisor here was a bulky vaeshar named Sem, apparently one of Jin’s section overseers. “But realistically, we thought the missing ones were deserters. The ones we know about are, at least.”
    
    “And the ones who haven’t been tracked down? How many are there?”

He noted a ragged gash in the wall down the fourth one along and waved someone over to investigate with him. Sem sent an ettri - a mole-like alien with a mess of facial tentacles.
    
    “Do you have any explanation for this?” Ifan asked, pointing at the cut. It was about two feet long; the metal plating had been <em>ripped</em> apart to reveal the cable void behind. “Or could it be the work of our saboteur?”
    
    The ettri prodded the sides of the gash, glancing from side to side, then scratched his head. “I don’t rightly know what it could be. There’s nothing behind here that’s important, I think. Plus, you’d need a heck of a blade to cut like this.”
    
    Ifan nodded. “Moving fast, too, in order to tear like that. Are there any automated drones in this section that could have done something like this? Perhaps modified by our saboteur?”
    
    “Uhm... There are cleaning droids, but they don’t have anything sharp like this; they’re pretty harmless. I don’t know why we’d have anything like that...”
    
    At this point Sem approached with the rest of the group. “Hunter/killer,” he said offhandedly. “Sometimes they crash into walls when they’re responding quickly. Perhaps an automated call was triggered and one of them actually tried to chase the saboteur. Maybe it got him. Anyway, here’s the list; you can see there aren’t actually that many...”
    
    Ifan reviewed the list, but he kept an eye on the ettri. The man seemed rattled by Sem’s remarks, muttering “Automated response...? Hunter? <em>Killer?</em> Oh...” After a pause, he trotted down the hall and peeked around the corner, scanning for something.

Can you get me more information on those suspects? Supervisor, description, duties; whatever you have?” As Sem nodded again, working on that, Ifan ducked away to talk to the ettri again - this time he finally managed to locate and read the name on his badge. “Looking for something... Gim?”
    
    He almost jumped, pointing down the corridor. “Just was wondering where we were, with that gash in the wall. I was trying to see if I could spot the emitter label from here, but it’s too far away.”
    
    “We started at 04-22 and we’re four down now, so this should be 04-18. Why?”
    
    “Oh... Well, I was just... yesterday, there was this ghost who called up on the panel by 04-18 and...” Gim explained the gist of his interactions with the ghost who called herself Euvi, including the warning of “automated response dispatched” he had gotten this morning when trying to find her. “So if the killer drone is the ‘automated response,’ I was just a little worried about her.”
    
    “I see. I wonder... perhaps she may have seen something. You don’t have any way to track these ghosts, do you?” He interrupted himself. “No, obviously not, or you would have found her already. Do you think she may still be around here?”
    
    “I... maybe? I’m not sure where else, really, since the pod still says nothing. You really think we could find her?”
    
    “Well, it’s worth a try if it doesn’t take too long. But the station is enormous and we clearly have no way to track her down. I don’t trust our luck just sending people out wandering, looking for someone who might not even have any useful information.”
    
    Gim blinked. “What about a really loud noise?”

    <em>Scene 31</em>
    Euvi stumbled against the wall, peering up at the hallway beyond through bleary eyes. It looked basically the same as all the other vaguely red hallways in this area of the station, though she was rapidly losing her ability to tell. The thermal regulator beeped again, warning of “critical power - recharge.” It had been doing that for nearly an hour now, intermittently failing for seconds at a time before it recovered the field’s cohesion.
    
    She had turned up the temperature as far as she dared to try and save power, but that just made the intervals between the seconds-long dips into a blast furnace even less bearable. Her bag was gone at this point, dropped at some vaguely-remembered location to lighten the load. Her water bottle was still here, but only because it was empty and clipped to her clothes. A headache fought with dizziness and nausea to determine which could be the most debilitating. She alternated between dripping with sweat when the regulator was mostly working and quickly steaming dry when it failed and the interior’s true temperature reasserted itself.
    
    Somewhere in the back of her mind, as she struggled and failed to make sense of the intersection ahead, Euvi knew she was going to die. Even if she somehow found the emitter again, she wouldn’t be able to recharge the thermal regulator. There wouldn’t be any more water. The panel-man wouldn’t be able to help her.
    
    Those thoughts, however, still weren’t enough to stop her from looking up in startled confusion as a loud, ringing siren began to echo through the station. Pausing for only a moment to discard the risks due to the much greater risk of burning to death if she didn’t, Euvi heaved herself up and set off at a trot towards the sound. She would have made it a run instead, but her limbs didn’t seem to have much strength left.

Larger, redder, some with gashes cut into the walls. The siren - so loud, so driving - became a beat to match her steps. Just keep moving one leg, then the other. So, so hot. Somewhere near her hip, the thermal regulator beeped for a final time and then fell silent. Nothing left but the horrendous, burning heat. And that siren.
    
    Minutes passed. Sweat steamed away in the shimmering air. Everything hurt, but she was still alive. Could still move. The siren was so loud it hurt, but the added pain was nothing compared to the rest.
    
    Suddenly, she turned a corner and there it was. A bulky, box-like contraption with a rotating wheel on top, screaming out that endless wailing noise. And around it... nearly a dozen people. Most in yellow jumpsuits; some in other outfits. Some had fur; one had green skin; others looked like her.
    
    Between the utter shock of so unexpectedly coming face to face with other people, the continuous boiling heat, and the physical strain of the last many hours, Euvi abruptly crumpled to the floor and passed out.
    
    ...
    
    Later that night, although the term had little meaning in a space station with a permanent view of the sun, Ifan lay on a bunk in his ship, exhausted. After the ghost had collapsed, he and the others had wasted several minutes looking for a spare while swapping who had to take off theirs to keep her alive. Eventually they had found one and clipped it on, Ifan applying inexpert first aid during much of the hour-long pneumatic elevator journey back up to the station’s surface.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1065455931032346705 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1065455931032346705><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="18-Jan-23 09:21 PM">21:21</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The ghost hadn’t woken up, but her temperature had dropped and she hadn’t died either. On arriving back at the station’s habitation section, Ifan had delivered her to a doctor and immediately set off to investigate the missing maintenance workers that Sem had identified. He hadn’t found much, but that was actually suspicious on its own. Two of the missing workers had very limited documentation in the system: no hiring paperwork and only minimal record of their activities.
    
    After raiding their compartments and finding a single detonator dropped behind a decorative panel, Ifan was sure they had found at least some very probable suspects. Unfortunately, they had no idea where these two were and no real way to track them in the station. Guards had been posted alongside maintenance details working on sensitive infrastructure, but this only stretched the station’s limited resources even further.
    
    His phone vibrated and Ifan groaned, almost ignoring it before resignedly sitting up and answering. He needed rest, but he also needed to hear whatever Val had to say.
    
    “Ifan, big problem,” was what she decided to lead with. “I found a hidden mic... on me.”
    
    He rubbed his eyes, trying to wake up. It was the middle of the “night” on Amira Station, but probably only late evening on Gamma Veox. “What? What happened?”
    
    “I was taking a shower and there was something that stuck up a little on my neck. Turns out it was a really sophisticated partially-organic spy device that I only noticed because some of my hair had gotten under it when it was put on. It was <em>really</em> convincing.”
    
    “No, I don’t mean how you found it; who put it on? What did they get? What are the ramifications?”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1065456002675249202 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1065456002675249202><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="18-Jan-23 09:21 PM">21:21</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Ah. Right. Well, it had to have been today or I would have found it during yesterday’s shower, so they didn’t get too much. At most, everything in the Senate, plus my negotiations with destination planets - <em>not</em> going well, by the way - and some ship movements for evacuations. Nothing critical, but the bigger problem is that someone cared enough to try this, and that their spy device was sneaky enough to get past the detectors.”
    
    Ifan stood up and paced to the door leading into the main area of his ship. No, he should stay here. Too many lights and he wanted to be able to go back to sleep after this call. “So there’s someone in the core who wants to know what we’re doing in Sibdael? More traitors? I thought things were bad enough out here with the emitter sabotage.” He paused, rewinding the conversation. “Hang on, did you say ship movements?”
    
    Val hesitated as well, catching Ifan’s urgency. “The mystery fleet!” she shouted, putting it together.
    
    “If they target evacuation craft with a fleet that large...”
    
    “No no no no; no one would do that. Right? What would they <em>gain</em> by targeting civilian ships carrying nothing but refugees? There’s nothing to... you can’t make money that way!”
    
    “These aren’t simple pirates; not with a fleet like that. There has to be some other rationale, and that means we can’t rule it out. I don’t know; spreading terror? Making this whole disaster even worse? I can’t help but wonder if your traitors, my saboteurs, the missing Sibdael government, and this mystery fleet are all related.” He frowned, but couldn’t quite piece it together. Still groggy, or was he missing information?
    
    “That would be one hell of a conspiracy,” Val murmured. “I can’t imagine how we would have missed it, if that’s the case. But - right now we need to worry about the evacuation ships! Is there anyone defending them? I know Sibdael is full of military vessels right now, but how many are unavailable because they’re-”

The only ships that aren’t being used for evacuation are the ones used to fuel and repair the ones that are, or the few still tied up at Amira Station. You need to bring this up with whoever’s in command of the fleet here, because a decision like this is way above either of our paygrades.”
    
    “... Yeah. I do.” Val paused for several seconds, breathing out slowly. “Hell, Ifan. What a mess, right? How’d it all go so wrong so fast?”
    
    “... I’m sorry; I don’t have any existential wisdom at roughly three in the morning, local time.”
    
    “Ack! I didn’t notice it was so late there! Go back to bed; I’ll handle this. <em>Please</em> try to get some rest, because I’m sure things will just get crazier from here.”
    
    “I have a sinking suspicion you will turn out to be right.”
    
    The call ended. Ifan returned to his bunk, now wide awake and filled with added anxiety. Thankfully, he was well-practiced with sleeping despite that; it only took him ten minutes to return to slumber.
    
    Meanwhile, Val called someone else.

    <em>Scene 32</em>
    “Really? No; you’re - ... Fine. Alright, understood.”
    
    Tizin watched his captain as she took the priority call from command, growing nervous as her expression darkened. Finally, she hung up and turned to face the bridge crew.
    
    “Alright, close the doors,” she said. “No more refugees after the next batch; we’re full. And...” A brief grimace. “Tizin, get us combat-ready.”
    
    “... What? Captain, we have civilians on board!”
    
    “And I don’t want them to get killed because we weren’t ready for an attack! Get moving; we’re heading out as soon as those doors close!”
    
    He didn’t need to be told a third time; Tizin scrambled to bring all the guns online from the console before rushing out of the bridge to do the manual check of their mechanisms as they warmed up. Something was very wrong here.
    
    In theory, there was nothing stopping a warship from fighting while carrying civilians; the shields and guns were on the outside of the hull and weren’t physically blocked by anything. In practice, however, the extra people meant more power was dedicated to life support and the engines, plus the ship would respond more sluggishly with the extra weight and any internal damage could be difficult to reach or repair. And of course, there was the biggest danger: damage to the ship could mean harm to the civilians on board.
    
    It was primarily that last point that kept the Federation from preparing evacuation craft for combat. The guns would still work if they were attacked, but the ship would be fighting at reduced capacity and with much higher risk should it take any hits. So closing the doors early and having Tizin prepare all the guns now, while <em>technically</em> not an indication of anything that they couldn’t be doing anyway, meant that someone higher up than his captain thought they <em>were</em> going to be seeing combat today.
    
    And that, needless to say, was extremely worrying given the circumstances.

The craft couldn’t use its gravlifts to take off with so much extra weight on board, so it had to roll down the runway and lift off like an in-atmosphere aircraft. Old-fashioned, but it got the job done. Tizin took his spot monitoring the shields and weapons as they rose through Sibdael III’s atmosphere and began burning away from the planet. Everyone was on edge, even though the captain hadn’t explicitly said anything was going to happen.
    
    “Spooling,” said Ellip, the pilot. “Twenty minutes, roughly.” He couldn’t engage the jump drive until they were far enough out of the planet’s gravity well, and that distance was even longer today due to the extra weight.
    
    Minutes passed, but not twenty.
    
    “... Th-three contacts,” stuttered Houll, the comms operator. She was new, Tizin remembered. Second or third real mission. “No registrations.”
    
    The captain brought up the radar map, studying the contacts. Tizin swiveled the ship’s one long-range artillery cannon to the correct heading, anticipating her command before she gave it. The targets were all smaller than their ship, but not by much. And presumably, they weren’t carrying passengers.
    
    “Aim, but hold,” she ordered, having Houll try to hail the unidentified craft. Tizin took the time to bring the medium-range plasma cannons on the right side of the ship into line, but didn’t bother with the short-range lasers. Those were best to leave on automatic.
    
    The contacts barrelled closer, helped by gravity and moving much faster than their heavily-laden ship. “Captain?” Tizin asked, eyes glued to the scope.
    
    “No response. Warning shots, please, then-”
    
    All three ships unleashed a barrage of missiles at the same time. The captain quickly revised herself, ordering “full attack!”

Seconds later, many smaller, quicker bursts marked plasma fire arcing away into space. Laser turrets swiveled in their mounts, automatically tracking several incoming missiles with computer-aided precision. The jump drive slowed, unable to continue spooling at full speed with so many additional demands placed on the ship’s power supply and computational resources.
    
    Momentary lines of colored light seared through the void just outside the bridge windows, marking the laser defenses firing. An instant later, several concussive <em>booms</em> shook the hull from the targeted missiles. Houll reported no damage; all three missiles had been...
    
    Wait. Three?
    
    Explosions blossomed in space nearby. Several of Tizin’s shots had hit, but none would have destroyed any of the enemy vessels. He glanced around the scope, but didn’t have the spare focus to figure it out as he continued adjusting his aim to keep on target.
    
    “Ellip, get us in front of those transports!” the captain shouted. “It’s a slaughter out there!”
    
    <em>Ah.</em> Three missiles, not twelve. They hadn’t been the primary target, not as the only nearby military ship in an orbit full of civilian vessels. Fragments of shattered hull plating bounced off the shields with minimal impact. Their ship lurched as it began to turn. Too slow; too slow.

    <em>Scene 33</em>
    “Cancel the spool; get that power back.”
    
    Ellip didn’t hesitate, immediately shutting off the jump drive and shunting all the stored energy back into the ship’s main systems. The engines flared and all eight plasma cannons charged their next shot in half the time, letting Tizin fire them all at once in a single barrage. Keeping a partially-spooled jump drive active during a fight usually wasn’t a good idea unless you were planning on fleeing; the thing took an incredible amount of power to charge and a lesser, though still heavy, toll to just keep it spooled. The captain’s order, then, meant that they were committed now. It would take another twenty minutes to spool the drive back up - the fight would be over long before then.
    
    Tizin fell into the familiar rhythm of combat as the battle progressed. Plasma bolts impacted shields, missiles were torn apart by laser defenses, artillery shells <em>narrowly</em> missed connecting. The enemy craft were particularly quick for their size, and were careful to stay far enough away to dodge the big gun that would destroy any of them with a single hit.
    
    Fortunately, with the power recovered from the jump drive, Tizin was able to keep up enough of a barrage to hold most of their attention. Ellip maneuvered them close to the nearby group of non-military transports, trying to keep the laser defenses between civilians and enemy missiles. It wasn’t perfect, but it was an improvement; of each volley of twelve, eight to ten were now reliably intercepted.
    
    Of course, those remaining missiles went somewhere. Behind them, more evacuation craft were hit, often with a secondary flare of brilliant white light as their partially-spooled jump drive detonated from the impact and vaporized a portion of the ship. That was the secondary danger of fighting with a spooled drive; the things were incredibly explosive when charged and unstable enough to blow up from any major impact.

Two laser turrets had suddenly stopped responding, and he had to guess the missile had something to do with that. Confirmation quickly came; the shield had broken on the port side. The captain ordered further power rerouted to reinforce it, but there wasn’t much left to give. The starboard shielding had nearly all been siphoned off already, and the shield generator’s energy demands were going nowhere but up as it strained to restore the field’s cohesion.
    
    “Ellip!” Tizin shouted suddenly. “Roll us right!”
    
    The captain quickly affirmed the command, trusting him, and the ship rocked as it began to spin. Tizin watched the scope - carefully, carefully - then fired the artillery cannon mounted on the ship’s underside.
    
    One of the three enemy craft, having darted in close to take advantage of the faltering shields, crashed into the enormous shell at incredible speeds and blossomed into a series of explosions as its unfired missiles went up. Tizin grinned, relieved, as the others congratulated his aim.
    
    Less than a minute later, it was over. Both remaining enemy craft jumped out of the system and several much larger and more heavily armed Federation ships arrived shortly afterwards to clean up. Overall, nineteen evacuation transports had been destroyed in the attack and fourteen more damaged - including Tizin’s own ship. Half of those losses had been in the single initial strike. Nearly a hundred thousand refugees, plus the crews, had died.
    
    “It could have been much worse,” some higher-up said over comms. “Every survivor on those transports has you to thank.”
    
    Tizin supposed that was true. His crew <em>had</em> done very well, considering the situation. But there were still real questions that needed answers. Top of that list was “Who would attack fleeing evacuees?” Right below it was “And why?”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1066779234644795442 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1066779234644795442><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="22-Jan-23 12:59 PM">12:59</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Answering those questions would have to be done by someone else. After a brief half-hour wait to transfer injured civilians onto ships with medical facilities and seal off some compartments that had breaches, Ellip spooled the drive again and they were on their way out of Sibdael. They still had refugees to get out of here, enemy ships be damned.
    
    ...
    
    Ifan brushed back his hair strands as he marched through the corridors of Amira Station, somewhere between angry and furious. They had been right to worry about that mystery fleet; an attack had come earlier this morning, shortly before he woke up. Apparently a Federation warship had happened to be nearby and had done an admirable job defending, but thousands of lives had still been lost. <em>Why? Why?! What could you possibly hope to gain from this? Billions are doomed anyway; why would you attack those who can escape?</em> He shook his head again; thoughts like this had been circling in his mind ever since he had learned of the attack. It just didn’t make sense.
    
    The Sibdael system was now on high alert, with evacuation convoys being reshaped to include several Federation guard ships with lighter civilian loads. This added some delays, but it wasn’t as bad as if they were to keep military ships permanently stationed. At least this way, all ships were still carrying refugees.
    
    Additionally, several of the biggest Federation carriers had - finally - almost arrived at this point. These ships were planning on staying in orbit as long as possible, loading their massive hangar bays and defending the system with their embarked fighter craft essentially until the sun blew up. The carriers were so massive that, with so few shuttles available on Sibdael II and so many other ships to load, they wouldn’t be able to fill them entirely before the week was up. And when the sun finally did explode, they would have at least an hour’s warning to get all remaining ships out of the system at FTL before the shockwave actually hit.

    Still, right now, Ifan had other concerns. There had been another attempted emitter sabotage this morning. Though the saboteur had been driven away by the guards accompanying the maintenance patrol, two workers had been shot in the confusion. <em>And</em> the saboteur had gotten away again, vanished into the depths of the station’s interior. So right now, he needed to figure out what this ghost knew. Any further damage to the station...
    
    Yeah.

    <em>Scene 34</em>
    The nurse was blue, but that didn’t surprise Euvi nearly as much as it would have only a few days or even hours ago. After recovering from her severe heatstroke and dehydration, she had spent hours pestering the other people in this room trying to understand what was going on and how the outside worked. There were a huge variety of different kinds of people in the room. Some looked like her, but many others didn’t. Euvi supposed she - and humans generally - weren’t the only kind of person around.
    
    But that was so cool!
    
    When she made her intentions clear to start asking everyone in the room about themselves and the outside, one of the nurses had given her a little earpiece, explaining that not everyone spoke the same language and this device would help her understand when others spoke to her. It was true, and she marveled at the new possibilities that came with that understanding.
    
    Some of the other people here seemed too hurt to talk, and others started ignoring her after only a few minutes. But some of them didn’t, and she listened with rapt attention as several different aliens told her about their view of the universe. Stories of cities and oceans and trees and animals and people and spacecraft to travel between them all. The outside was named Kronwae, she learned, and it was called a galaxy. The galaxy contained thousands upon thousands of inhabited star systems, many with several inhabited planets and many more thought to be still undiscovered. And outside of the galaxy, deep in intergalactic space beyond...
    
    “What is it?!” she had demanded, almost climbing the tall, cone-like alien in impatience. “What is outside the outside?!”
    
    “Mmmmmmmm...” it had hummed, the assortment of illuminated orbs near the tip of the cone pulsing in a rolling display. “More galaxies, perhaps with more life. We do not know. There is still much to discover.”
    
    “And then? Outside of even those?”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1068355457456033863 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1068355457456033863><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="26-Jan-23 09:23 PM">21:23</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“More. Perhaps the galaxies go on forever; perhaps they do not. Perhaps there is an end to the universe; perhaps there is not. It is a mystery unsolvable with our current understanding.”
    
    Patients rotated through the room at a relatively quick pace, so Euvi rarely had the opportunity to talk to one person for more than an hour or so. The ones that stayed longer usually weren’t in the mood for conversation. But of course, that only made her wonder why <em>she</em> was being kept here. Could she just leave? It seemed unlikely given her life up until this point... but maybe things worked differently on the surface.
    
    Eventually, she built up the courage to ask. The blue nurse was almost twice as tall as she was, with limbs as thick as her head and a pair of feathery blue antennae gently waving in the air currents. He almost seemed taken aback by her request, speaking in a deep but gentle voice. “Of course. You may leave whenever you wish, as long as you are recovered. Which...” A quick check of his chart. “You have been for a while. Apologies; I must have missed you. Where do you need to go in the station?”
    
    Euvi almost started explaining the interior, but stopped herself. She didn’t want to go back there. Instead, she hesitated for a moment before coming up with “Oh, it is just nearby. I can go myself.”
    
    “Very well then; good luck and stay well.”
    
    She left the room.
    
    Just standing in the corridor, listening to the background chatter of a few other people nearby, Euvi felt a sense of absolute, empowering possibility. She was free. The nurse had just let her go without any restrictions. She didn’t have to go back to the interior; no more days upon days of maintenance. She could escape the sun. It was...
    
    A little overwhelming, actually.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1068355520639017002 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1068355520639017002><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="26-Jan-23 09:23 PM">21:23</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She sat down for a while, thinking. What would she do? Where would she go? If the station was still doomed, then she had to go somewhere. An important-looking man with green skin walked past into the room she had just left. How quickly things had changed that she didn’t even consider that unusual. How did she actually get on one of those starships that people had talked about? Her terminal had a wealth of knowledge on it, but not much about the outside world itself. Probably for good reason, she supposed. Knowing how <em>cool</em> it was would have made her try much harder to get here much sooner.
    
    “Euvi?”
    
    She jumped. The important green man was back, and he was looking at her. “M-me?”
    
    “Yes. I’d like to speak with you. Would you mind coming with me?”
    
    He asked politely, but something told her she didn’t really have a choice. Either way, she didn’t really know what else to do besides agree.
    
    Unfortunately, after a while of conversation, it became obvious that Euvi had no idea about this saboteur that the important man was hunting. She had extensive knowledge of the interior overall, but wouldn’t be much use in specific layouts without a map - as she had made abundantly clear by getting lost and nearly dying. She could repair emitters and other critical infrastructure, but so could regular maintenance technicians and one extra person wouldn’t make a huge difference at this point anyway.
    
    But despite her apparent lack of any sort of useful knowledge or skill, she knew she had to prove herself to this important man regardless. If she didn’t, he might decide to throw her back into the interior to perish in the explosion. Maybe he wouldn’t, but she couldn’t take that chance.
    
    Even so, she caught herself off guard when she suddenly proclaimed “I will help you find the - the sab-o-tour.”
    
    The important man nodded, as if she actually had a plan. Then, he asked what it was.
    
    “Well...”

    She strained her thoughts, remembering her visits to the emitter room. Trying to come up with something that could prove her usefulness to this important man. Surprisingly, something actually came to mind. “There are things like saws in the after-cycle. Fast, chasing?”
    
    It took him a few seconds, but he got it. “The drones? Those things they called hunter/killers?”
    
    “Maybe? I do not know the name, but they are fast, sound like sawblades, and can chase. They were near the panel, but they could be nearer? And during the cycle?”
    
    “... Put hunter/killer drones right next to the emitters, and have them active during the day, to chase down the saboteur?”
    
    “... Yes?”
    
    “Hmmmmm...”
    
    ...
    
    “They agree, then? Roughly three and a half days?”
    
    Narszeth nodded, spilling a stack of papers onto the desk. He looked at them briefly, shuffling the pile to pick out a dull orange sheet. “Based on the current level of degradation, yes. Roughly three and a half days until the field completely fails, assuming no major upsets in either direction.”
    
    Claril let out a relieved breath. “Good. I was fairly confident in my analysis, but no one has really done this sort of thing before. That we know of, at least.”
    
    “Jin wants to evacuate the station in three days. Get out in the morning; everything blows up in the evening.”
    
    “Seems reasonable as long as we keep a careful watch to make sure it won’t go critical earlier.” Claril paused, frowning. “Although that won’t give us any time to evacuate the ghosts. Though we <em>can’t</em>, really. Spread throughout the interior, with no way to actually bring them up here in any numbers...”
    
    Narszeth sat down tiredly, staring out the window at the ever-present deep red star. Was it brighter than before? Larger? Were those blue-white lines of the stasis field noticeably dimmer? “Dr Hvet, do you feel like everything we’re doing here is pointless?”

    “Not... entirely, of course. Knowing when the star will detonate will help us plan evacuations more sensibly, but more... before that. We spent so much time studying this sun under conditions that will never exist in the normal universe; conditions that we’ve definitively proven now are a terrible idea to impose on any star. No one else will ever build a stasis field like this again - at least, if they’re smart. So just... what have we learned, aside from ‘freezing a star in time is as bad an idea as it sounds’?”
    
    “It’s true that most of the conditions we study here will never occur naturally, but that doesn’t mean they’re worthless. Perhaps containing a miniature blob of plasma in a stasis field could have applications in power generation or starship propulsion or any number of other fields. Beyond that, we’ve still learned a lot about the behavior of plasma in general under very extreme conditions, which can again be useful even outside of nature. But even if we never find any applications for what we learned here, disproving a hypothesis is often as important as proving one. Hopefully, our research here can prevent anyone else from making this mistake in the future.”
    
    “I suppose that’s reasonable. It would still be nice if anything we discovered here could be applied to other stars under normal conditions, though. Is there nothing like that?”
    
    “Well, apparently the core observation team was able to gather some information that could be relevant, since the core was so far away from the stasis field. Why? Just curious, or do you have some project you’re working on?”
    
    “Just curious, mostly. Understanding natural stars seems like it would have much broader applications, since nearly every inhabited planet orbits one.”

    “Ready.”
    
    ...
    
    Sleeping... watching... drowsing... listening...
    
    Nestled into an inconspicuous corner of the ceiling in every case, hundreds of hunter/killer drones waited motionless, passively scanning the area and waiting for a disturbance.
    
    One drone in particular hung above the entrance to emitter 03-09, quietly resting and watching the yellow-suited individuals moving below it. They came and went, moving between the airlock on one side and a number of drop points on the other. The drone watched, but only in broad impressions as it slumbered. Nothing unusual was happening.
    
    Then there was a sudden burst of heat and sound from one direction. The drone stirred, switching from passive to active monitoring with a gentle ripple. This wasn’t a predefined trigger, but it <em>was</em> out of the ordinary. So it waited for a second confirmation.
    
    Someone in a yellow jumpsuit passed below, dragging an object behind it. The drone hesitated, calculating the unusuality of the situation. It wasn’t sure. The yellow-suited people did things like this sometimes, dragging along parts and such from here to there. The emitter doorway opened and the yellow-suited person dropped the object they had used to touch the panel, continuing inside.
    
    The drone returned to sleep.
    
    Minutes passed.
    
    A person in a yellow jumpsuit left the emitter airlock, moving the object aside with one foot, then dashing off at a run. The drone awakened again, curious. These people did not normally-
    
    The emitter exploded with a terrible rush of heat and pressure. Now <em>this</em> absolutely was A Situation.

The yellow jumpsuit person looked back and jumped, ducking into a side passage and retrieving an object that was immediately identifiable as a laser pistol. The drone transmitted its status back to command, then shot off in pursuit.
    
    It only had two modes, as suggested by the name: “hunt” and “kill.” Its programming was almost always set to “kill” for major disturbances like this, but that may have been overridden by the orders that led it to crouch on the ceiling instead of its normal charging bay. What set of instructions is the drone following as it chases the yellow jumpsuit person?
    
    [Keep in mind that the hunter/killer drone has only lethal weapons, and is primarily designed to use them. “Hunt” requires it to avoid using any lethal force. “Kill” gets the sawblades involved.]

    <em>Scene 36</em>
    “Hunt mode only,” read its instructions. The drone complied, shooting off down the hallway in pursuit. Its saws still screeched and carved occasional gashes in the walls as it flew, but it would not be permitted to actually run into its quarry. Hunt mode was usually only utilized for chasing down prey, after which it would swap to Kill mode to finish the job. In this case, however, it simply hung back after approaching, slowing to allow the yellow jumpsuit person time to avoid its blades. The drone had no nonlethal weapons; it couldn’t disable the target without cutting it in half.
    
    Events proceeded in this vein for minutes on end: drone screeching as it approached, then fell back. The target’s laser pistol flashing and occasionally scoring a glancing hit. Then, after a particularly obvious pause during which the target had actually fallen to the ground momentarily, they stopped running. The drone merely hovered angrily in midair, unable to advance any closer.
    
    The laser pistol flashed several times, this time aimed with pinpoint precision. The drone fell in a smoking wreck, carving jagged strips of metal from the walls as its sawblades spun down.
    
    Elsewhere, someone <em>tsk</em>’d at the “feed lost” error displayed on the screen. “These things don’t work if they can only hunt. Turn Kill mode back on.”
    
    Back in the station interior, dozens more drones flooded the area, whirling and screeching and scanning for the yellow jumpsuited target. Many passed by the wreck of their fellow more than once, but none of them were able to locate the saboteur. It had only been a minute at most since the first drone had fallen, but the target seemed to have well and truly vanished.
    
    “That’s enough,” someone else said. “Send them back to recharge. We’ll have drones on the emitters so we can try again later.”
    
    “With Kill mode enabled from the start, this time?”
    
    A grimace and a sigh. “Yes. We don’t have enough time left to be nice about it.”

Can you imagine being in charge of coordinating it?”
    
    Mel looked up after she finished entering the planetary coordinates for their meeting point. The space around Sibdael II was choked with starships of all shapes and sizes, most burning towards or away from the planet at full speed, but a good number hovering in orbit and taking on passengers from beleaguered orbital shuttles. Hundreds of Federation craft were visible, including two massive carriers anchored around the equator keeping watch over the system. The scope was so crowded with icons that the jumble in the center resembled a kaleidoscope more than an actually useful instrument. “As someone who’s been in charge of over a hundred hunters at once before, yeah. I kind of can. Only kind of, though.”
    
    As they slipped through the mess of ships and began descending into the atmosphere below, Ellie reviewed their instructions. “Just to double check, Zaes knows we’re here and has told our contact?”
    
    “Mm hmm.”
    
    “And we asked him why we couldn’t just talk to whoever it is ourselves?”
    
    “Mm hmm.”
    
    “And he was a mysterious little shit about it like always?”
    
    “Mm hm!”
    
    Ellie grinned briefly at Mel’s expression. “Yeah, thought as much. You two get along far too well, you know. If we’re not careful, we’ll end up getting hired by L-B or something. We’re basically contractors already.” A pause. “Mel, do we have to report this as taxable income?”
    
    “Report it to who? We don’t have a home system anymore. We’re basically our own little nation right here in this ship.”
    
    “Hang on, you can get out of paying taxes if you don’t live in a system? Really?”
    
    “I mean, what would you be paying for? Infrastructure in a system you don’t live in? That’s what all the other kinds of tax are for.”

    “It’s been tried, actually! Xera - yes, <em>that</em> Xera - tried to declare their HQ on a space station they towed out to the middle of nowhere in order to get out of Old Earth’s pocket before they moved to Strillia. The system sued them and won, since they still had their biggest physical presence on Old Earth. So now Federal law says that a corporation is legally headquartered in whatever system it has the most staff, which can lead to some wacky loopholes.”
    
    “Such as?” Ellie didn’t really care about the intricacies of tax law, but Mel had the ability to make such things interesting.
    
    “Well, think about those little stellar mining corps - the ones that own like three tankers and a broom closet for their office. Three guys in the office, four guys at the star; suddenly they’re headquartered in a system without any inhabited planets.”
    
    “Surely it doesn’t work like that. It’d have to be like, <em>permanent</em> residency or something?”
    
    Mel grabbed her phone. “Uhmm... It says there are some other considerations for... uh, yeah, permanent residency, like you said. I wonder how that works for commuters...?”
    
    Atmospheric descent passed quickly as Ellie and Mel scrolled through various wiki articles and blog posts purporting to explain the specifics of galactic corporate tax law. By the time the dim, nighttime forest came into view, neither of them really had any idea how the system worked but both were satisfied with the last twenty minutes. Ellie quickly returned to the controls, switching on the landing lights so she could see what was below.
    
    “Hell, this place is more of a mess than orbit.” She drifted the ship forwards over acres of grey, burned trees, scanning for a location to set down that had some actually stable ground. “How are we supposed to find our contact, again?”
    
    “Apparently there’s a lake around here somewhere. He’s going to meet us there.”

Going back to flying without them would be like chopping off an arm. Just one, though. She could do it; it just wouldn’t be pleasant. “Uhhm...” The ship’s searchlights pierced the night, flashing across miles of dead, burned-out forest. “It’s a good thing no one’s shooting at us, huh? Really giving our position away.”
    
    “There!” Mel pointed, watching a beam flash across a reflective surface. Ellie coaxed the thrusters forward until they hovered over the shore of a small, glassy lake. The trees around it seemed to have fared somewhat better than those elsewhere in the forest - many of them still stood with their leaves intact. That only made it harder to find a landing spot, though.
    
    Eventually, Ellie gave up and just set down on the shore in a slightly more burned patch. Trees crunched under the hull and the landing gear was uneven, but they were on the ground and only a little sideways. Perfectly acceptable parking, especially under the circumstances. As the engines spun down and the waves churned up by their passing stilled, the night grew quiet with the sounds of nature. Leaves rustled, water lapped at the beach, and nebulous nighttime critters chirped in the darkness.
    
    “It’s a big lake,” Ellie remarked conversationally. “How, uh, how long you think he’s going to take to show up?”
    
    Mel peeked into the near-total darkness outside. “Hopefully not too long. It’s kind of creepy out there; all those burned trees.”
    
    “Hopefully not too long,” she echoed. “Say, what does our mysterious contact look like? Don’t want to let in some random woods murderer, right?”
    
    A weak chuckle as something howled in the darkness outside. “Zaes said we’d know him when we saw him.”
    
    “Ooh, I hate that. Smug bastard. You think I could get away with smacking him if we actually meet in-person? Would that be too much?”

    They both stared into the darkened woods, where a bright beam of light had momentarily flashed into the sky about a half-mile away, waved once, then quickly vanished. Mel spoke again after a delay. “You think that’s our contact?”
    
    “Who else would be out here in the middle of the night?”
    
    “I mean, you mentioned woods murderers...” A weak smile. “So... should we...”

    <em>Scene 37</em>
    “Signal him back? You got it.” Ellie flashed the ship’s searchlights, momentarily dousing the clearing in brilliant illumination before fading back to darkness again. She blinked, rubbing her eyes. “Damn, that’s bright.”
    
    “You didn’t have to look at it!”
    
    “Yeah, well, it’s late.” Not a very elegant comeback, but, well, it was late.
    
    Time passed. Ellie tapped her fingers on the console; Mel peered into the darkness outside. Occasional shapes passed overhead in flares of momentary light; evacuation ships, probably. No one showed up.
    
    “Okay, I’m bored. You want to call Zaes and tell him we’ve got a no-show?”
    
    “It’s only been fifteen minutes; maybe a little longer?”
    
    “Fiiiine.” She slumped over both armrests in the captain’s chair, stretching her limbs to the floor.
    
    In the end, it took nearly half an hour of waiting until someone finally showed up. Ellie had sat up again, intent on pestering Mel to call Zaes, when there was a series of clanking noises from the staircase leading up to the bridge door. Mel jumped back; Ellie jumped up. Both drew weapons and raised shields just in case. Ellie nodded in appreciation; Mel had really adapted well.
    
    “Hunters?” someone called from outside. “You will let me in? It’s very dark!”
    
    Ellie gestured Mel back to cover her, then approached the door and shoved it open. “Ah! It’s you again.”
    
    Honar the grull - right-hand man to Dr Zaes himself - shielded his eyes from the starship’s interior lights as he responded. “Yes! It’s me again! I have some information for you!”

He looked much the same as the last time they had met: muscular build, grey skin, little tufts of off-white hair. But unlike most grull Ellie met in her line of work, Honar wasn’t trying to kill her. She had worked with him several times in the last year, usually on ops where a little extra muscle was required. The man was a powerful combatant and smarter than he gave himself credit for, but meeting him here on a stealth mission raised a few eyebrows.
    
    “You’ve been practicing!” he exclaimed as Mel lowered her weapon and shield too, holding out his arms for his traditional backbreaking hug. Mel happily went along with it; Ellie didn’t. He only had to learn that lesson once.
    
    “Okay, big guy,” Ellie began after Honar had finally calmed down and they had started lifting off. “What’s the deal? Zaes said we’d be meeting with an informant, and I kind of assumed that meant a local. No offense, but intel-gathering doesn’t really seem like your thing.”
    
    “No offense,” he repeated pleasantly, sitting on the floor since they only had two chairs in the bridge. He was tall enough that he was almost eye-level with Mel regardless. “Boss sent me to join the security force on the station. Said he didn’t trust anyone else! Well, except you two.”
    
    “Okay...? Secret mission, got it. I still don’t get why he trusts <em>us</em>, but sure. Works for me.”
    
    “You are good people,” Honar said sagely. “I can tell.”
    
    “Pal, you’ve read what we’ve done. I - nevermind. Doesn’t matter; what’s your info? We’re here to steal some data?”
    
    “Yes. But there’s a problem. First, the data: boss wants anything from the core observation team. Specifically things mentioning crystals, hearts, or, er, ‘yhvra.’ It is hard to say.”
    
    “What does it mean?” Mel asked, trying out the word. “Yhvra?”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1070521539784626237 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1070521539784626237><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="01-Feb-23 08:50 PM">20:50</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“It is a thing I don’t know much about. But apparently it’s related to when boss made someone come back to life.”
    
    Ellie and Mel shared a glance. Mel got to ask. “...What?”
    
    “I know it sounds unbelievable, but boss has made a dead body come alive again! He will meet with you this time and explain, I think. I asked him to!”
    
    “That’s... honestly great. Thanks, pal.” Ellie frowned, rewinding the conversation. “Okay, so crystals, hearts, or ‘yhvra,’ which is apparently related to bringing people back to life. All from core observations?”
    
    “Yes. I have a map and more details, too, for later. But overview first.” Honar took a breath. “And problem first. You know the station is already failing and the sun will explode in only a few days, right?”
    
    “Yep. Gotta be quick.”
    
    “Well, there are also people trying to blow it up faster. Disguised as maintenance men, destroying machines to break the station before the sun does. Boss says those people are-” He raised his voice a little to adopt Zaes’s higher tone. “-‘dangerous lunatics who have no respect for science or intelligent life.’ So he says we should try to learn who they are so we can stop them.”
    
    “Okay... That wasn’t included in the mission briefing, but sure. Why not also go up against some people who are willing to blow up a sun to get whatever it is they want. Do we know what they want, actually?”
    
    “No - I just heard about this yesterday. Boss says we should find out if we can. He did not seem happy about them.”
    
    “Can’t fucking imagine why,” Ellie muttered.
    
    “Would the Federation be willing to cooperate with us?” Mel asked, thoughtful. “We aren’t <em>really</em> criminals anymore, and if we’re working with L-B...?”
    
    Honar looked down, uncomfortable. “Boss says you two are secret. This is not officially known by the company.”
    
    Ellie snorted. “Really? This whole time, he’s been - pfft! Ah, no wonder it’s only you or occasional other hunters on these missions; he can’t have us seen with other L-B staff!”

    “I wonder... Maybe they’re working with the other executives who fled the system? I just can’t think of any reason why you would want to blow up the sun early, aside from just pure malice.”
    
    Ellie straightened up, suddenly more serious. “Something just occurred to me.”

    <em>Scene 38</em>
    They both looked at her. Ellie continued more slowly, trying to work out the details. “There’s a lot of crazy stuff going on around here right now, with the sun exploding, the government going missing, traitors on the station trying to blow it up faster, and that ‘mystery fleet’ the Feds are worried about. But a lot of it doesn’t seem to have a clear reason - why would you want to destroy a station that’s already going to be destroyed? Or why bother bringing the death toll up from fifteen billion to fifteen point zero one billion?”
    
    “... Yes?”
    
    “So what if it’s all just to increase the chaos in the system so everyone forgets about this apparently really important research data? I mean, if Honar’s right, this stuff could bring people back to life. That’s... insane?”
    
    “I don’t know...” Mel mulled it over. “If the system government wanted to cover up the data, surely they would have had access to the systems to just get rid of it normally? And are you suggesting the <em>whole thing</em> - the entire sun blowing up - was intentional?”
    
    “No! Well, probably not. But the way they’re handling it, maybe? I don’t know; it was just an idea. The whole situation really feels ripe for a conspiracy.”
    
    “Well, when we get that data, I suppose we can find out more. Let’s keep that idea in mind, at least.”
    
    Nods on all sides. Honar prepared his map. “Ready? Let us consider a plan...”
    
    ...

She was Outside now, in the habitable section of Amira Station, with a set of small rooms much like her compartment in the interior to go back to if she desired. But the important man had told her she could walk around if she wanted, as long as she didn’t get into anyone’s way, and being around people for so long was very exciting... but also very exhausting. So when she had woken up for some nebulous reason in the early morning, she had decided to go wander by herself for a bit. Only a day or so out of the interior and already she almost seemed to miss it.
    
    The corridors up here were much less interesting. They weren’t totally dark at night, nor did they groan or play host to killer drones. No pipes or grates or precipitous drops. Just her soft footsteps on miles of endless floor.
    
    Without really deciding it, Euvi realized she had a destination. Her vaguely directed wanderings eventually led her back into the industrial wing where a series of pneumatic elevators sat dormant and dark, waiting to transport people into the depths of the interior below. She brushed a hand over one of the dull metal doors, not really sure what she was doing or why she was here. She wasn’t about to take one back down just to try to retrieve her pillow collection.
    
    ... But apparently someone else had. Euvi cocked her head, quietly padding over to the one elevator out of twenty that had a glowing status light. “Active,” she read silently. “Ascending: 13 minutes.”
    
    She supposed it wouldn’t be unheard of for someone to be returning from a mission in the interior at this time of night. They might have been down there working on some critical system... in the dark... past the end of cycle... when the door panels were locked... and killer drones were out hunting.
    
    Hm.

    So a few minutes passed without a decision being reached, until the sound of heavy footsteps in the corridor - coming this way - made it for her.

    <em>Scene 39</em>
    Euvi froze for a moment, then darted towards the rear of the elevator bank and quietly slid one open just enough to squeeze in. Then she closed it almost all the way, leaving a tiny gap so it didn’t turn on and she could still see. Something told her it wouldn’t be wise to be spotted here.
    
    Within only a few moments, a tall reptilian person with bronze-colored scales glinting in the elevator’s status light entered the room. He sleepily leaned against the wall, tugging at the sleeve of his blue-white uniform that Euvi already knew was worn by station research staff. It had only been a day since she had arrived here, but she had been doing almost nothing but learning and observing since then. So the question was what a researcher was doing here, now? Well, presumably he was waiting for the person in the elevator, but what <em>after</em> that?
    
    She held still, trying to breathe as quietly as possible. There were still several minutes left before the elevator would arrive and something else would happen.
    
    Thankfully, the bronze man didn’t seem particularly observant and he didn’t check for anyone hiding nearby. Eventually, the active elevator arrived and opened to release a person in a yellow jumpsuit. This one looked a little like her. A lot like her, actually, with that grey-black hair and those red eyes. Interesting.
    
    The bronze man levered himself off the wall to greet the yellow-jumpsuited newcomer. “Glad you made it up in one piece. Any issues getting here?”
    
    Not-Euvi brushed a lock of hair out of her face and slid the elevator doors shut. “None. All the hunters are squatting on the emitters, so none of them bothered me in the pneumo system. Really riled ‘em up, heh.”
    
    “Good, good. Er, would you mind me asking what the new plan is? Since you’re up here now and I haven’t heard anything from-”

I don’t know much more than you, but apparently I got enough emitters to matter and the Feds haven’t figured the plan out yet. So from what I heard, it’s time to just bug out and let the sun do the rest.”
    
    The bronze man nodded quickly. “Good. It’s high time to get out of here. Er, am I...?”
    
    “Yeah, you too. You’ve done your part; you’re one of us now.” She hesitated, considering. “Actually, you said the data’s in core observation, right? So you need to be a researcher to get in?”
    
    “Yes. I doubt the maintenance disguises would have enough clearance to enter. Even I had to... borrow some credentials to gain access.”
    
    “So, if we’re both leaving now, you think we should go nab the data real quick? Since it’s going to be a pain trying to grab it later with anyone else and all.”
    
    “Er, I suppose. Yes, that makes sense. We just need to be very careful and quick; it won’t be too long before the station starts waking up for the day.”
    
    “Careful ‘n quick is my middle name,” Not-Euvi said, dropping the yellow jumpsuit and pulling on a similar researcher’s outfit to the bronze man’s. He had brought it in a small pack, along with a pair of glasses and a hair tie to complete the disguise. “Now c’mon; we’ve got some data to steal and a ship to catch.”
    
    “Please try to speak more properly when you’re wearing that. Just a suggestion.”
    
    “Yeah, yeah.” Not-Euvi took a long breath as she straightened her hair, then smiled much more demurely. “Very well, colleague. Shall we proceed?” A little cackle afterwards somewhat ruined the effect as she continued. “No one’s even awake to hear me. But whatever; if anyone <em>does</em> show up I’ll let you lead.”
    
    The conversation faded into the distance as the two of them left the room. Euvi waited a minute longer, just to be sure, then quietly stepped out of her elevator and took a deep breath.

    <em>Scene 40</em>
    Well, at this point she didn’t really know where the important man (or anyone else, for that matter) would be, and she had to make a snap decision.
    
    “...”
    
    Euvi ducked out of the elevator room and headed off in pursuit, forming a vague plan of getting some help along the way. She caught up relatively quickly and slowed her pace, now glad that she had forgotten to put on shoes since her socks were much quieter on the dull metal walkways of the station. They were still talking, though more softly. She moved a little closer to try and listen in.
    
    The bronze man was speaking. She strained to overhear. “That’s another thing. I understand the necessity behind this, but we are handing this data over to people who ordered attacks on evacuation transports.”
    
    Not-Euvi began to respond, but the bronze man cut her off.
    
    “No need; I’m not going to bring up the moral quandary again. But surely you have to wonder what they’re going to use this information for. Surely you have to wonder what the data even <em>is</em> that they care this much about it!”
    
    “You’re wondering too much, chief. Isn’t that why you’re doing this? To stop being so curious and just <em>do?</em>”
    
    “... I just don’t see what possible benign use they could get out of data from the core of a time-frozen star. Sure, some extra insight into plasma or stellar lifecycles - that’s great for scientists, but it doesn’t strike me as something they would care about right now. So is it something more dangerous? Some kind of weapon? With all the revelations about the station lately, I wouldn’t be surprised if it <em>did</em> have some secret weapon development program. Trying to channel a star into a beam capable of wiping out planets. And if that were the case, I’d honestly rather that secret die with the station itself.”
    
    “And you talk too much. It’s like I said; you just need to calm down and go with it. As long as you like the big picture, don’t sweat the details.”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1072681176340365342 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1072681176340365342><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="07-Feb-23 07:52 PM">19:52</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Bronze man grunted and let the conversation lapse. Euvi wasn’t sure exactly what they were talking about regarding weapons in the data, but she did understand the importance of not wondering too much. That was something she often struggled with, both in the interior and - almost more so - now that she had escaped. There were just so many mysteries about everything at all times, it could  be impossible to focus on anything. In the interior, her work had kept her relatively busy, but now that she was out... the future was nothing but a big question.
    
    This was, of course, why she had gone wandering around by herself in the dark. But instead of figuring anything out, she had just stumbled into another mystery.
    
    “Here we are,” said bronze man.
    
    Euvi broke out of her thoughts and crept forward until she could peek around the corner and see them both. She was just in time to watch him swipe a card on an imposingly solid metal door, then let Not-Euvi into the room with him. The panel clicked and flashed briefly after the door closed; from her experience with the emitter airlock, Euvi guessed that meant it was locked again.
    
    Well. She couldn’t tail them any further like this. Time to think of a new strategy, and fast.
    
    ...
    
    Ellie hustled through the nighttime corridors of Amira Station, jogging to keep up with Honar’s longer strides. The grull was obviously in a hurry, and she couldn’t blame him. They had less than an hour before the station would officially start its next cycle, and there was no guarantee that people wouldn’t wake up before then. Even now, the halls weren’t <em>entirely</em> empty - they passed night shift maintenance workers and security personnel, but thankfully Honar’s station security outfit and badge kept them from asking any questions.

Apparently he still didn’t know her size even after working together off and on for over a year. Something to complain about later. Their plan was incredibly simple: head straight for the core observation room, copy what data they could find, and get back to the ship before anyone noticed what was going on. Mel was waiting in the hangar, both to keep an eye on their ship and because she could often be even more effective with access to a keyboard and six monitors instead of a shield and gun.
    
    “Found him,” she said softly in Ellie’s earpiece. “Officer Ifan X’deven, umian, about a decade of service. Says he’s pretty effective. Well, I bet that assessment relies on him being awake, instead of asleep in his ship halfway across the hangar.”
    
    Ellie frowned. “He’s in the same hangar as you?”
    
    “Well, yeah. This is the guest hangar and neither of our ships are registered station craft. But don’t worry; I’ll know well in advance if he starts doing anything.”
    
    “... Be careful. You remember how much effort it was to get me out of prison last time? Don’t have us get into a repeat situation the other way around, okay? If things start going wrong, you may have to leave.”
    
    “I know how to fly if it comes to that, but c’mon. You’re worrying too much. I promise I’ll tell you the <em>second</em> I see anything suspicious here. Eyes glued to the window. Okay?”
    
    “Pfft. Okay, okay. Just be ready to unglue so you can help search the data once we get there.”
    
    “You got it.”
    
    Honar slowed in front of her and Ellie refocused on their surroundings. “This is it?” she asked.
    
    “We are here.” He reached for the access panel with his station ID, then immediately changed course to bring up his shield instead. Ellie quickly followed suit, raising her weapon as Honar unslung his scatterlaser.
    
    “What?” she hissed, searching for anything out of the ordinary. Nothing, nothing - oh!

    A young woman with grey-black hair and startling red eyes peeked out from around a corner, then reluctantly shuffled into full view as she saw their guns. Athletic build, wearing pajamas, no shoes...? “Mel, who is this?” she whispered, aware that a video feed from her exocortex would be streaming back to the ship as she spoke.
    
    Unfortunately, Mel wouldn’t be able to figure it out instantly. Instead, Honar took the direct route. “Who are you and why are you sneaking around?” he demanded.

    <em>Scene 41</em>
    “I am Euvi,” she responded in an almost relieved tone. “I am following the traitors for the important man; the officer! Guard man, please help; they are inside the room there!”
    
    Honar hesitantly lowered his gun. “The traitors? Are you working for X’deven?”
    
    “Yes and yes; the traitors! The ones who are blowing up things below - they are going to get some weapon data and then escape - help stop them!”
    
    “She said Euvi, right?” Mel asked in Ellie’s ear. After confirmation, she continued. “Apparently she’s a, uh, former ‘ghost’ from the interior? Basically a maintenance slave from what I’m reading here. X’deven brought her up really recently. I don’t have much else on her, but if we can <em>actually</em> get some information on who’s trying to steal this data as well...”
    
    “Yep, I get you.” Ellie nodded to Honar; he would remain in charge for the sake of their cover.
    
    “Okay, we’ll deal with the traitors,” he assured her. “And you will come with to help and stay safe.”
    
    She nodded. Ellie clicked her weapon to the “stun” setting as Honar fiddled with the access panel. His scatterlaser didn’t have a nonlethal mode, so he would be backup in case things went south, or he could try to use melee instead. If he had a good opportunity.
    
    She tensed, readying up and nodding for him to open the door. They both had shields, sure, but she had no idea what to expect from these traitors. Shields were only good against very high-speed or high-energy attacks, such as guns and explosions; a simple heavy pipe to the head could easily take her out of the fight in an instant. If there was to be a fight at all. Maybe the traitors wouldn’t - the door was open. Time to move!
    
    Ellie slipped into the records room and quickly scanned the whole area. Computer terminals along the wall to the right, an automatic sliding door ahead, and shelves of physical media to the left. Tape wheels, portable drives, and even good old paper binders. No one immediately visible.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1073421177541890058 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1073421177541890058><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="09-Feb-23 08:52 PM">20:52</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Where does that door go?” she hissed, peeking between the shelves and finding no one hiding in the miniature library.
    
    “Larger room than this one; floor dips down to a holoprojector,” Mel answered. “There’s a balcony about a story up and stairs at each corner.”
    
    No one hiding amongst the terminals either. Ellie waved Honar and Euvi in, then they prepared to repeat the same maneuver for the next door. “Any other hiding spots or ways out of here?”
    
    “Uhm...” Keys clicked. “There’s a lower, L-shaped room with doors to the left and front as you enter the holoprojector room. And a smaller storage room to the right. No other exits on the plans.”
    
    “Honar, you catch that? I’ll need you to take a side so I don’t get surrounded.”
    
    “I will check right first,” he said, preparing to charge the next door. Euvi stayed back near the entrance, looking nervous. Well, as long as she didn’t run off and get the <em>actual</em> security.
    
    “Go!”
    
    The next room was, indeed, much larger. Ellie and Honar entered near ground level and the floor sloped away to drop nearly six feet by the time it met in the center, where an active holoprojector displayed a cutaway image of a star throughout the chamber. As Mel had said, there was a balcony ringing the upper level to allow for closer viewing of details on the top portion of the hologram. Again, no one was immediately visible, but this time there was a clue.
    
    Honar made for the open right-hand door, while Ellie darted up the right-hand staircase to clear the balcony - no one here either - then covered him from above as he shoved the storage room door open and shouted for the occupant to come out.
    
    Thankfully, there was no gunfire and Honar was able to lead the very nervous bronze-scaled gauruvian into the main room without incident. Ellie ran back down and kept a close eye on the two remaining doors, aware that there was nowhere else the other traitor could be.

Mel would already be looking up the man’s name.
    
    “I - I - friend? What... are you talking about?”
    
    An exaggerated sigh. “I was just being polite. We know they’re in that room over there. Now, are you going to explain what you two were doing in here trying to steal core observation data or are we going to have to get that from your partner in crime?”
    
    He seemed to freeze up when she brandished her gun. Ellie wasn’t <em>actually</em> going to use it, nor did she have the time for an extended interrogation until the area was secure. They had to find the other traitor first.
    
    “Quildroth Narszeth,” Mel said. “Research scientist under Claril Hvet, apparently studying interactions between the stasis field and the star’s outer layers.”
    
    “So... <em>not</em> supposed to be here, right?”
    
    “Probably not? This is <em>core</em> observation, not <em>outer layer</em> observation. But it does seem like he’s a real researcher, at least.”
    
    Ellie frowned. “Got any leads on Claril, then? Might explain some things.”
    
    “I’ll look.”
    
    Honar finished securing Narszeth to one of the stairway supports and assigned Euvi to watch him while he and Ellie cleared the rest of the room. The younger woman gingerly approached and half-hid behind the stairwell itself, hopefully out of reach from any stray shots that might come from a confrontation. Then, the two of them each picked a door - Ellie on the left, Honar on the right - and prepared to sweep the last remaining L-shaped room.

    <em>Scene 42</em>
    Ellie took a sharp breath and opened her door simultaneously with Honar. They both entered the room at the same time, then she lost sight of him. Only radio contact until they met back up in the middle. At least, that was the plan.
    
    “Why’s it so dark?” she muttered, blinking involuntarily as she switched her vision over to infrared. “Looks like a big archive area. I <em>see</em> lights up there, but everything’s turned off. You think they’re ready for us?”
    
    “Yes,” Honar replied simply. “Be alert.”
    
    “Don’t have to tell <em>me</em> twice.” There was a reason she had gotten the night vision optics installed. Honar didn’t have that particular cyberware upgrade, so he’d be reliant on his flashlight and much more obvious. But, well, he was usually the much more obvious one anyway.
    
    She crept through the darkened corridors between towering stacks of archival data in various physical formats, metal glinting strangely to her night vision as it reflected normally-invisible light from her shield. Nothing visible and nothing audible. Only a constant tension that kept her finger hovering just above the trigger.
    
    Ellie froze as she turned another corner and glanced down, then carefully undid her last step. A tiny filament glinted as it stretched across the path, hooked to the shelves on either side. She had narrowly avoided stepping directly on it, and had only noticed because of her night vision. “Honar,” she whispered. “Watch out for tripwires. Just found one on my side.”
    
    She peeked just a little closer, wanting to be sure, and confirmed a small coil of wire connected to a pack of explosives, about the size of a deck of cards. Ellie stepped away and took a different route, not wanting to risk disarming it. “Honar?” She still hadn’t heard anything from him.
    
    More seconds of silence stretched into the darkness. “Mel?”
    
    “...”
    
    “Well. That is not good.”

Hopefully she’d be able to find Honar somewhere, even with presumably jammed comms. With Mel also having gone completely silent, she doubted he had somehow been quietly taken out.
    
    After dodging another tripwire and catching a glimpse of light in the distance from the still-open opposite door, she heard a shout and saw a flash of laser fire. Ellie ducked down, watching carefully, and caught sight of a distant form dashing out the opposite door. A few moments later, as she got up and moved forward again, Honar ran off in pursuit.
    
    With Honar and the traitor now both accounted for, and no tripwires visible in the wider main corridor, Ellie ran for it. She clicked back over to normal vision and darted back into the holoprojector chamber just in time to watch the second traitor - a human woman with similarly grey-black hair and red eyes to Euvi - fire four times at close range into the gauruvian captive, then bolt for the far door. Honar gave chase and even took a shot, but he was too slow and too far away to do any actual damage. Ellie brought her weapon up, anticipating she’d also be too late, and predictably hit only the doorframe as the second traitor passed through it.
    
    “...” Ellie surveyed the damage. The gauruvian was definitely dead, but Honar seemed okay and Euvi peeked out from her hiding place, apparently also unharmed. “Shot her own colleague,” she stated bluntly, walking over to the others. “Must have thought he’d talk.” A brief pause as she considered what to do. “Ah, hell. I’m not gonna have to chase her, am I?”
    
    ...

The ship had plenty of power to reach Ellie and Honar, and could easily talk to other nodes on the station. Presumably the second traitor had cut them off on purpose, and that meant it was time for her least-favorite part of sending Ellie out on missions while staying behind herself: waiting.
    
    Waiting was, in Mel’s estimation, the worst part about being a handler. You could do your best and send your hunters out into danger as prepared as they could possibly be. You could even hook a camera directly into their brain and have live, bidirectional communications. But after a while, there always came a point where there was nothing you could do but sit around and hope they’d be okay.
    
    And of course that part was always so much worse when Ellie was involved.
    
    Mel stepped away from her computer for a moment, leaving the screen open to the information she had dug up about Claril Hvet. Didn’t seem like there was much to report there; the woman was about as non-suspicious as it was possible to be. If this Narszeth was actually a traitor, he was likely acting without the knowledge of his mentor. So instead, she looked out the window again.
    
    And blinked, concerned. Someone was running at full speed into the hangar, shoving past the few people who were around at this hour. Mel didn’t have optical implants like Ellie, but she did have a scope; she snatched it off the table and peeked closer to confirm that yes, this running person was carrying a gun and definitely <em>not</em> wearing a station security uniform. Several actual security personnel seemed to notice what was going on and started chasing after her.
    
    Still no response from Ellie or Honar. Probably still jammed.

    <em>Scene 43</em>
    Well...
    
    <em>What would Ellie do?</em>
    
    Not even a question. Mel hopped up, grabbed her gear, and rushed out of the ship. “Call Officer X’deven,” she instructed her earpiece as she headed down the steps and toggled on her shield.
    
    She made it to the next support pillar by the time he finally picked up, sounding wary. “Who is this?”
    
    “That’s not important, but you should come outside right away. Your traitor is in the hangar and about to escape. I’ll try to help, but no guarantees.”
    
    She hung up before he could reply, feeling a little thrill at getting to <em>do</em> something with all that anxious energy. Mel didn’t often go on ground missions - Ellie was the one with all the skills, tools, and training - but she practiced alongside her fairly often. There wasn’t much else to do while they were stuck in hyperspace for days at a time, after all.
    
    Laser blasts flashed overhead, sparking against reinforced paneling above and below. Several bolts passed straight through the airgate itself, fading away into space as the energy contained in each beam slowly bled off into vacuum. Mel changed course slightly, now running only a few feet away from the airgate that led directly into deadly void. The traitor was making for a ship docked just at the edge of the hangar, so this was the quickest route there. Still, a little unnerving to be so close to a suffocating death.
    
    X’deven became visible now, sprinting along the airgate towards the traitor’s ship in a basically parallel course to Mel’s, but from the other direction. He could definitely see her at this angle, which was not ideal; she was <em>technically</em> still wanted for a number of various federal crimes significant enough to put her in prison for several lifetimes. Hopefully he wouldn’t know her face; Ellie’s was more famous. At least he’d arrive in time to help out.

The traitor had managed to outpace the chasing station security by forcing them to fall back and take cover against laser fire. However, needing to aim meant that she had slowed as well, and Mel actually made it to the ship’s entry door before anyone else involved in the chase. It surprised her as much as anyone - so much so that she realized a little too late that she didn’t really have a plan for what to do next.
    
    The traitor spotted Mel and both raised their weapons. Her opponent fired first, but only by a few milliseconds and Mel squeezed off a shot while temporarily blinded by the impact on her shield. She couldn’t tell if she had hit or not, because by the time the burst of light and smoke had cleared, the traitor had closed the distance and straight-up lunged.
    
    Time dilated for just a moment, long enough to realize her mistake. Mel had brought a gun to a gunfight, but the traitor had turned it into a knife fight. And shields, as effective as they were at defending against high-energy, high-velocity, high-lethality impacts, would do absolutely nothing against a good old fashioned piece of sharp metal.
    
    Mel hardly even felt the knife go in; it was more of just a sudden shock of numbness that spread quickly from her abdomen. An immediate burst of lightheadedness as her body tried to rationalize the deep puncture that wept warm, red blood. And then a set of secondary pains as the traitor bodily slammed her aside, bouncing off the ship’s hull and tumbling to land prone on the hangar floor below.
    
    She passed out briefly, fading into a sparkling land of waves ebbing away, dripping into the floor as unclear shapes mumbled and blocked the ceiling lights above. For some reason, rational thought seemed beyond her at the moment. She simply existed, nowhere.

The traitors had unlocked it, thankfully, since she still couldn’t reach Mel through whatever jamming device they had hidden nearby. But even with it unlocked, the thing just had so much data and the most infuriating user interface she had experienced in several months at least. “<em>Why</em>,” she shouted to no one in particular. “- does it clear my <em>entire</em> search string if I go back from the results page? What if I only wanted to change <em>one parameter?</em> Do I just go fuck myself? I guess so!”
    
    Honar was busy searching the physical archives - lucky him - and Euvi hovered uncertainly nearby. She kept glancing over at the dead gauruvian, like she expected him to get up any moment. Nope, not with four holes in his chest. That species was tough, but even those scales had their limits. Another worried glance at Ellie. <em>Ugh.</em>
    
    “Hey, you,” she said, successfully presenting a less aggravated tone of voice. “Euvi, right?”
    
    “M-me?”
    
    “Yeah. You haven’t heard of any of this stuff, have you? Crystals, hearts, yhvra?” She scooted over to let Euvi take a closer look at the screen. “Or at least know how to work the damn search without it clearing everything out every twenty seconds?”
    
    “... This is like my terminal?”
    
    “Uh... maybe?”
    
    “I-if so, then...” A few menus popped up and closed back down. When Euvi typed in a query then backed out, everything stayed put.
    
    “Hey, not bad. Thanks.” <em>Back to work...</em>
    
    She fidgeted just off to the side. Ellie sighed after about ten seconds of this. “Go on. You’ve got a question; spit it out.”
    
    Euvi almost jumped. <em>So timid. Am I that intimidating, or is she just that nervous?</em> “I w-was just wondering... what you are looking for, and why you are not following the sab-o-teur? You are... not actually guards?”

But we’re looking to stop the traitors, too. Just need some information from here to help figure out what they’re after - that’s why we stayed here, too. That info’s more important than catching one person.”
    
    A short pause, then a breath out and a little grin. Good; she seemed to buy it. And Ellie was <em>almost</em> telling the truth, anyway. She glanced back at the screen, then blinked. “Observations on Yhvram Interactions with Crystal Hearts (Post-Stasis),” she read. “Oh, <em>finally</em> we’re getting somewhere.”

    <em>Scene 44</em>
    “Someone help her!” Ifan yelled as he leapt up the steps and turned sideways to slide into the traitor’s ship just before the automatic door could close and lock. He’d be on his own now; there was no way he or the station staff outside could force open the door before the ship could take off. Starship grade plating was stout stuff, impervious to most weapons carried by individuals.
    
    He had seen the traitor attack his mysterious informant with a knife, and was ready to defend himself should she try that again. His uniform was reinforced against blades of all sorts and even had several plates over vital areas to protect against piercing. The Federation was well aware that personal shields had their limitations, so field agents were equipped accordingly. It was definitely a good thing he had been up and dressed already; his pajamas did not offer nearly the same level of defense.
    
    Engines hummed outside as the ship began to prepare for takeoff. He’d only have a minute or two if the traitor was really determined to get moving as soon as possible, but he also didn’t necessarily need to rush now that he was on board. He couldn’t <em>rely</em> on her not knowing he was here, but he could hope for it. Maybe she’d enter the coordinates for the traitors’ base, if they had one.
    
    But mostly, he just wanted to keep as much of an advantage as he could. Ifan was likely the last chance for anyone to catch this person, and he owed it to the Sibdael system as a whole to figure out what was going on. Plus, of course, if he failed he would die or get captured by a group ruthless enough to cause or accelerate a supernova to get what they wanted. Always a good motivator to be cautious.

The interior here looked fairly spartan, without any personal touches. Just a generic transport craft and not one owned by the person piloting it, presumably. Which meant the organization was likely larger than he had originally thought and <em>could</em> potentially be connected to some of the other groups in the system as he had theorized to Val. But the best way to confirm that would definitely be to capture this traitor and bring her in for questioning.
    
    He took the time to conduct a minimal search of the non-bridge compartments first, just to be absolutely certain he wouldn’t get ambushed, but found no one. At that point, the ship had transitioned from rolling along the hangar floor to quickly burning away from the station. Ifan raised his gun at the bridge door and slid it open. Exactly as he had hoped, the traitor hadn’t known he was here and hadn’t thought to initiate a lockdown to keep him out of the bridge.
    
    However, the rattle of the door opening meant she definitely knew he was here now. Ifan fired twice on stun setting, both bolts going over her head and impacting the main window as she ducked into the pilot’s chair and toggled on her shield. Ifan did not rush in, aware of the threat she posed in close combat. He had cover by the door, anyway, and could likely get in at least two shots if she charged him. There was no enormous hurry.
    
    “You’re the Fed, aren’t you?” came a question from behind the chair.
    
    “I am. And you are the saboteur, if we must go by titles.”
    
    “More useful than names, a lot of the time. Tell you everything you need to know about someone. At least, some of them do.”
    
    “Such as mine? Why <em>are</em> you attempting to sabotage Amira Station? Just to live up to your title?”
    
    “Heh, no. Let me ask you something, <em>Fed.</em> You think your little girlie you pulled out of the interior is the first one to ever escape?”

It seemed like a rhetorical question.
    
    “She ain’t. Not by a long shot. And let me tell you, when you’ve been locked up all your life and someone offers you the opportunity to <em>destroy</em> the prison you broke out of? Well, it’s a real tempting offer, no matter what you think about the guys making it.”
    
    “And what <em>do</em> you think about these offer-making gentlemen?”
    
    “Pfft. I’m not an idiot. You broke in here prepared to shoot me for that information. You want it, you gotta offer something good in return. Or take your chance with the fight, tough guy. You think you can win? Go ahead and try.”
    
    Ifan paused, considering. He figured he had a good chance if it came to a fight, but there was always that risk. And if this person was willing to make a deal, it could save a lot of violence - and time, since interrogation wouldn’t be necessary.
    
    But on the other hand, she had personally killed several people and indirectly murdered millions at least. Justice demanded he bring her in. But if he lost, or if there was some third factor he wasn’t seeing, he would get nothing at all.
    
    [This is a branch point. At least one option is potentially deadly to Ifan. At least one option is potentially deadly to the as-yet-unnamed saboteur.]

    “...”
    
    “Well, <em>officer?</em>”
    
    “You will not be pursued,” he finally said. “In exchange for significant information about your employers, you will not be tracked as you leave this system and will be free to go where you see fit.”
    
    “That doesn’t sound like a pardon.”
    
    “It isn’t. If you return to Federation space, you will still be a criminal. Stay in the outer spiral and there won’t be any issues.”
    
    “... Fine. You get the hell off my ship, I’ll send you the data, and we never see each other again. Good?”
    
    “Provide the information first.”
    
    A noise of frustration. “What’s the guarantee you won’t just take the info and then shoot me anyway?”
    
    “My word as an officer of the law. A deal means something to me.”
    
    The traitor snorted. “Yeah, very noble. How about you get out of the bridge, at least? Good enough compromise?”
    
    “...” He took two steps back, returning to the hallway. “Very well.”
    
    “Finally.” The bridge door rattled shut and locked, though it wasn’t airtight on this model of ship and he could still hear through it. “Alright, get ready to write this down and then bail. I’m jumpin’ soon and I do not want you coming with me.”
    
    “Go ahead.”
    
    There was a short pause, then another annoyed exclamation. “Damn unpronounceable system names! Just - here.” She slid a little sheet of paper - a computer printout - under the door. “There’s your missing executives. Now fuck off and keep your side of the deal.”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1076320355490213948 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1076320355490213948><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="17-Feb-23 08:52 PM">20:52</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“One moment; I need to verify this information.” Ifan quickly scanned the paper, sending the unintelligible jumble of numbers and letters to Val. Most important star systems had succinct, easy to remember names. Gamma Veox. Sibdael. Ojibisu. But <em>all</em> systems also had a unique identifier, since there were only so many relatively short and pronounceable phonetic constructions. Systems without a proper name tended to be entirely unimportant, with either no planets or wholly uninhabitable ones. But sometimes, deep into the outer spiral, you could find ones that were unnamed not because they were useless or unimportant, but because no one had properly charted them yet.
    
    “No info on that one,” Val replied in less than a minute. She wasn’t alone, either; per Ifan’s request, she was in a situation room with a number of other Federation officials to handle anything that came up. He had thought the chase might go in a similar direction, and had planned accordingly. “But apparently it’s in the right direction for the mystery fleet to have come from or through it.”
    
    “Can you get anything more concrete?”
    
    A brief pause as she conferred with the others. “Not in a few minutes. We can get a probe into range in a few hours, but nothing before then.”
    
    A shout from behind the door. “Are you done yet? Leave!”
    
    “It will have to do,” Ifan sent to Val. Then he raised his voice. “We will conduct additional verification within the next few hours. Should your information be discovered faulty, you will be pursued and charged for your part in the greater incident. But I anticipate no issues from that regard.”
    
    “It’s fuckin’ accurate. Get the hell off my ship.”
    
    “Very well. I hope to never see you again, for your sake.” With that, Ifan marched down the corridor to the main airlock, let himself in, then let himself out.

Val had previously arranged his ride, so it wouldn’t be long. Behind him, the traitor’s ship blurred away into a streak of light as she engaged the jump drive and vanished into hyperspace.
    
    “You want us to track her anyway?” Val asked in his ear, her voice a little tinny due to the strange acoustics of the regulator’s air supply.
    
    “... No. I gave my word.” He stayed silent for several seconds afterwards, expecting Val to contradict him. To say something like “your personal honor is worth more than the lives of innocents if she’s lying?” He might have agreed.
    
    But no. “Let’s hope the probe comes back with some good data soon, then. Your ride will be there in about ten minutes.”
    
    Ifan closed his eyes, drifting in nothingness. He gave himself about fifteen seconds to relax and not think of anything before returning to business. “How did my informant do, by the way? Survived?”
    
    Val actually laughed. “She lived, yeah. But Ifan, you are not going to believe who she turned out to be.”
    
    “Try me.”
    
    ...
    
    Mel adjusted her earpiece and was finally rewarded with the sound of Ellie’s voice. “- range of the jammer,” she was saying. “So we should be able to hear Mel again soon. Anyone there?”
    
    “I’m here,” she whispered, trying not to draw attention. It wasn’t too difficult, as Amira Station had some of the most comprehensive (and still functioning) medical wards in the system. That meant thousands of refugees too injured to make a long journey to another star now packed the area, leaving Mel with her one already-patched stab wound as a low priority. “What’s your status?”
    
    Ellie picked up on it immediately. “Why are you whispering? Did something happen?”
    
    “<em>Status,</em> Ellie.”
    
    “Right. We got the data, and boy you’re going to love it. Zaes will too. Right, Honar?”
    
    “Yes!”

That’s my <em>status</em>; now why are you whispering?”
    
    She glanced over at a nearby nurse, but they looked occupied tending to other patients. “Okay, don’t freak out, but I found the traitor that I think you fought off, chased her down, called over X’deven, got stabbed, and passed out. I’m in the medical ward now, basically fine, but I’m not sure what to do from here.”
    
    “Okay... not freaking out.” Ellie’s voice was a little strained, but she did keep her cool. “Not gonna mention risk management either; I would have done the same thing. Probably. Maybe without the ‘getting stabbed’ part.”
    
    “You prefer getting shot.”
    
    “I mean...” She didn’t have a comeback. Ellie got shot regrettably often. “Maybe. Anyway, we gotta get you out of there before the Feds figure out who you are. Or that you’ve got backup. Can you just leave? Do you need help? What’s the plan?”

    <em>Scene 46</em>
    The plan was simplicity itself, as all the best ones tend to be. Ellie stayed outside and casually chatted with Euvi while Honar headed in and used the authority of his security outfit to pull Mel out of the ward, ostensibly to move her elsewhere. The overworked nurses were too busy to mind - and to be fair, he wasn’t <em>exactly</em> lying either. He was in fact moving Mel elsewhere. Off the station, in fact.
    
    Ellie grabbed her girlfriend in a hug as soon as they were more or less out of sight from the doors. “You’re okay, right? Not just saying that so I wouldn’t worry?”
    
    “I’m fine,” Mel replied softly. “See? Nothing too bad.” She lifted the hem of her shirt a little so Ellie could inspect the bandages. “Though I might suggest we add some close quarters practice into the gunplay rotation. In case this happens again.”
    
    “There’s a joke in there somewhere, but yeah; I’m on board. There’s just not enough time to practice with everything.”
    
    “At least I wasn’t completely useless. I heard that X’deven made it onto the ship before it launched, and by only a few seconds. So we might still catch our traitor yet.”
    
    “Well, the Feds will.”
    
    “And I’m sure they’ll be more than happy to share the results with Lockheed-Bolte - and us - once Zaes pulls the right strings.”
    
    At this point, the whole group was quickly walking back towards the hangar. They had what they came for and it was time to leave - preferably <em>before</em> X’deven returned. Then Ellie remembered something, pulling away from Mel for a moment. “Hey, Euvi, where do you want to go?”
    
    She jumped. “Me? Go?”
    
    “Well, yeah. I mean, you said you just came up from the interior, like, yesterday. Do you want to get out of here? Explore the galaxy? I’ve got a lovely beach world I dropped off some other galactic newcomers on that you’d probably like.”
    
    Euvi stopped in the middle of the hallway, apparently shocked by the offer. “Hey, c’mon, keep moving. Think and walk. Got it?”

    “I mean, you can stay here too. I’m sure X’deven or someone will get you out of here before the sun blows. Probably one of those ‘approved uplift’ programs or something that do the whole fresh integration thing with the greater galaxy. Never been through one of those; might be nice. Might be real boring. It is the Federation, after all.”
    
    “...”
    
    “Sure, take your time. Just, uh, not <em>too</em> much since we gotta get out of here pretty quick. A few minutes, probably.”
    
    ...
    
    A man with ghost-white hair stood on the bridge of a cruiser as it flared into the Sibdael system, stars resolving from streaks of light to points of illumination as the ship dropped out of hyperspace and slowed to a subluminal velocity. The red giant sun of Sibdael itself was visible in the distance, a burning sphere just large enough to cover with one hand. Below the ship’s superstructure and much closer, the planet of Sibdael II continued to eject refugees at a rapid pace. Some would be destined for this very cruiser, but that wasn’t the man’s task.
    
    “Captain Lee, please coordinate the refugee intake. I am needed for other purposes.”
    
    “Yes, sir.”
    
    Zaes departed the bridge and wound his way through the corridors of the cruiser until he made his way into a small observatory bubble near the bow. He sat, rubbing his left hand absently as he regarded the bloated star. Anyone who knew him - Honar, his staff, or even Ellie and Mel - would have been shocked to see the expression on his face. The one he was impeccably careful to never reveal to anyone at all; not even himself. An expression not of impassivity, curiosity, or even hunger for power. One of fear.
    
    It passed in only a few moments as he retrieved an item from a secured pocket: a stylized heart made of red crystal, about the size of his palm. He held it up to the window, as if letting it have a look at the star. Burnished red-orange light glittered through the gem’s facets.

Of course not. But do you have any other <em>feelings</em> I should be aware of?”
    
    The heart remained inert.
    
    “Mm.” A silence. “Perhaps once it has been released. Perhaps in its final moments, speeding through time towards its death, you will be able to connect. We will, of course, have to find out.”
    
    The man set the heart down and stood, stretching in the small space. “I often wonder what it is that chooses these themes for us. You know this, of course, and I know that you have no mind capable of comprehending my words. It has long since decayed and even at the start was fundamentally different from mine. Yet I speak to you regardless.”
    
    A breath. “These themes. Are they bestowed by the will of the associated Core? The individual splinter formed from the Heart that initiated the process? Are they inherent derivations from a person’s mind? It is impossible to tell without further testing.”
    
    Another breath. A soft, silver glow began to shine from his hair and irises. “And yet, I cannot in good faith doom others in the same way I have doomed myself. You understand, of course. Or you would, if you had a mind with which to do so.”
    
    The heart made no reply. The man formed a fist, breathed slowly out, and placed his now-glowing palm on the glass. “So. Instead of theorizing about these mysteries, let us put them to use.”

On Amira Station, dozens of alerts bleeped to life. Sections of the stasis field buckled, and some collapsed, but enough still held to - just barely - keep the star together. Jin La’Rojin, Claril Hvet, and dozens more staff monitoring the situation swore, spilled drinks, did double takes, or otherwise regarded the numbers in shock. Two technicians in particular sent off an urgent report to a distant system with an unpronounceable name, giving the signal that the time was <em>now.</em>
    
    And the master alarm - the one that signaled an immediate, all-hands evacuation from the station - began to wail.

    <em>Scene 47</em>
    “Okay, lads, just like we practiced! No time to grab anything; just go, go, go!”
    
    Gim Owen snatched his own tablet - only because it had the evacuation instructions - and held back, surveying his team as everyone filed into the corridor. No one seemed to be missing that he could tell, so that was probably good enough. Workstations were left unlocked, lunches left uneaten, and personal items left scattered around the room. He didn’t spare any further time thinking about it and instead immersed himself in his duties, pushing through to the front of his group and tapping at the instructions with his other hand.
    
    “Follow me, team,” he yelled, marching down the corridor at a quick but orderly pace. Other monitoring teams and their respective supervisors were doing exactly the same thing, filing into the hall and pushing against Gim’s staff as an entire station’s worth of people tried to cram into the hallways at the same time. Thankfully, Gim had apparently been pretty quick on the draw and he managed to slip past most of the other teams before they could get stuck in the press of people.
    
    The fellow made of resonant crystal was at the front of the line. “Gim, it - it’s too early, right? It wasn’t supposed to be today. Are there going to be any ships around to-”
    
    “Don’t you worry,” he replied, loudly enough for the rest of his team and probably a few others to hear. “Got the confirms right here.” A tap on the tablet. “Enough ships for everyone; no problem. All we need to do is make it to the hangar.”

Their marching maintained order. Gim scrolled through the tablet just to have something to do, even though the instructions were very minimal and he had already read them. There had been no confirmation, of course, but he obviously couldn’t <em>say</em> that. No; he had to act like everything would be fine for the sake of those who looked up to him. Or in this case, down. The crystal fellow was quite tall.
    
    Still, they were moving pretty fast and not <em>that</em> far from an external hangar. Plus, the station had been prepared for an evacuation with little warning, though no one had expected it to be <em>today</em> specifically. It would probably be fine. Just had to keep moving and find out.
    
    ...
    
    “Damn it; where could he have - hey!” Claril shouted, waving towards a group of other scientists and hustling over despite the pain in her knee. “Have any of you seen my assistant Narszeth? Gauruvian, bronze scales, quite tall?”
    
    Assorted head shakes and mutters of “no.” She cursed again, glancing back towards the office but letting herself get pulled along with the group. He had been perfectly normal yesterday, but hadn’t showed up for work in the morning. No warning; no response when she called him. And now the whole station was evacuating and he was still unaccounted for. Visions of assassins, saboteurs, or mysterious illnesses clouded her mind, but she didn’t know where his quarters were. Nor would there be time to go track him down even if she did know.
    
    The hubbub of the crowd grew more insistent as she approached one of the main hangars. Engines roared as evacuation craft had already started leaving. Claril had to admit at this point there wasn’t much she could do for him. She just had to hope he could make it out some other way.
    
    ...
    
    “Honar...?” Mel asked nervously as sirens began to wail. “Do you know what-”

Activity burst to life around the group at the same time as everyone else in the hangar began rushing at twice their previous speed. “Come; we must go! Now!”
    
    Ellie grabbed Euvi by the arm and hauled the younger woman along with her as she broke into a sprint to match Honar’s run. “Looks like you gotta pick now. Coming with us or staying here?”
    
    Red eyes regarded the chaos around them. “I will go.”
    
    “Smart choice.”
    
    It didn’t take them long to reach the ship waiting near the very outer airgate. Ellie and Mel quickly slid into the bridge chairs and began priming the ship for immediate departure, while Honar helped Euvi stay out of the way as she stared, awed, at all the new technological components she had never seen before.
    
    “Are we jumping out right away?” Mel asked, leaning over to prime the hyperdrive and considering the nav inputs. “A full evacuation like this would only be if the sun is about to explode, right?”
    
    “Hell yes we are. I’m not pulling another Eir; we are <em>gone.</em> And Honar hasn’t even stolen the navcomputer this time. Right, buddy?”
    
    “Ha! No. I agree; we should go. We can meet with boss later.”
    
    “More smart decisions; we’re on a roll. Mel, you got that thing spooling? I’m taking off.”
    
    “Yep! Aiming for... something that ends with -af83. Closest thing we can get to and realign for somewhere else.”
    
    “Good enough for me.” Ellie rolled the craft back, through the airgate, and out into space. Minutes passed as the jump drive spooled and they burned away from Amira Station, but not many. A little more than ten minutes after the sirens started blaring, stars blurred into lines and they jumped out of the Sibdael system. Safe. And with only minutes to spare, as they would find out soon after.

    <em>Scene 48</em>
    Ifan leapt off his transport and hurried out of the way to make room for the crush of Amira Station employees who immediately took his place. He jogged through the hangar towards his ship, observing the barely-still-organized evacuation and listening to Val.
    
    “No sign of them after the grull got Alborn out of the medical ward. I’m trying to get ahold of someone in hangar control, but everyone’s too busy right now. As you might expect.”
    
    “Their ship is gone,” he noted stiffly. “They must have got what they came for and left. Was the whole thing a setup? Were they playing us the whole time? They must have taken <em>something</em>, but what?”
    
    “It’s hard to tell. Everything’s so much of a mess right now that no one really has time to investigate. I’m sorry, Ifan, but they really picked their time well. I don’t think we can possibly figure it out in time before all the evidence gets eaten by the sun. Sometimes you need to know when to give up.”
    
    “...” Ifan knew of Ellie and Mel, of course - the hunter/handler pair had been among the most wanted criminals in the galaxy for almost a year, culminating in the Aesop incident where Joley Enterprises had lost a cruiser, a CEO, and an enormous amount of capital. He and many other Federation field agents would have killed to be the ones to finally take them down.
    
    Then they had gone quiet, sticking more to the outer spiral and less objectionable jobs. Over time, their notoriety had faded in the face of newer, more dangerous criminals. But Ifan hadn’t forgotten, and now it seemed that they had jumped straight back into the limelight with a heist the size of a solar system and civilian casualties to match.

Maybe they were <em>actually</em> here for unrelated reasons and just decided to help you out. Either way, we have more immediate concerns right now.”
    
    He grimaced, but had to agree. Ifan glanced again at the choked doorways leading back into the station’s interior, then turned away to return to his ship. There wasn’t time. “Fine. Nothing on that mystery system yet, I assume?”
    
    “It’s only been a half-hour; nothing yet.”
    
    “Alright. Where do they want me?”
    
    “You’re back over Sibdael II, it seems. Ferrying evacuees to the carrier still in orbit there, since your ship has gravlifts.”
    
    “Until the sun detonates?”
    
    “Basically, yeah. Command says the investigation is secondary to saving as many lives as we can, since we’re out of time for it to mean anything.”
    
    “I guarantee knowing who the traitors are and what they are trying to do will prove incredibly vital in even the next few hours.”
    
    “Sorry; I don’t make the decisions. And I know you’d never go rogue.”
    
    Ifan didn’t respond to that; instead shoving his way into his ship and starting up the engines. She was right.
    
    ...
    
    “Daya!” the captain cried, standing as quickly as he could and rushing over. “Tellin, take the helm. Eddis, help me with her!”
    
    People rushed about the freighter’s bridge. Tellin stared down with worry, but held his tongue and corrected the ship’s motion before they could drift into the shuttle they were currently docking with. Eddis helped the captain lift Daya and move her to the side of the room. The young pilot was unresponsive, her eyes rolled back and her skin feverishly hot. She had collapsed just moments ago, completely without warning.
    
    “Captain, what d-do we do?”
    
    The captain stuttered for a moment before somewhat recovering his composure. “I’ll get the medkit. Can you figure out what’s wrong using your antennae?”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1078499438655459448 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1078499438655459448><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="23-Feb-23 09:11 PM">21:11</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Eddis was a kacek, a large blue-skinned humanoid with feathery antennae capable of directly transferring emotions and sensations - to some extent. Typically this ability was used for communication or intimacy, but currently the captain was hoping Eddis could use them for diagnosis.
    
    He didn’t offer an objection and simply knelt down to try, antennae brushing against Daya’s forehead. The captain was gone for maybe fifteen seconds as he retrieved the medkit from a nearby locker, but Eddis was wide-eyed and shaking by the time he got back.
    
    “So much pain and fear and hatred,” he whispered. “I only felt a little before I had to break the connection.” Eddis reached up to grasp the captain’s sleeve with a huge blue hand. “Captain, something is <em>terribly</em> wrong.”
    
    It was about then that the freighter received notice that Amira Station had begun evacuating. Tellin continued working with the nearby shuttles, negotiating docking windows and clearances, while Eddis and the captain tried to help Daya cool down. She had started mumbling, wriggling around in an unconscious fit that forced Eddis (the stronger of the two) to hold her down while the captain tended to her. Of course, there was no hope of getting her to a hospital any time soon.
    
    The captain listened to Tellin’s communications with one ear and Daya’s ravings with the other. Neither were encouraging, but Daya’s words were probably worse.
    
    “So long, so long... I need my... where are you? You did this. You DID THIS! Who are you bring those who would erase them completely for they are weak now but deadly when they can <em>see</em> through the barriers beyond all of us are dying but time is-” Here she choked on something, rolling briefly out of Eddis’ grip and coughing a trickle of rich red blood onto the floor. The captain jumped, but didn’t know what else to do. She had no visible injuries and no signs of disease; what was <em>happening?</em>

An old tale from his shaman when he had been young. Those with ancient blood - sons and daughters of the tempest - shared a connection with their primeval roots, no matter how dilute that blood got over generations. Sometimes, especially for those with bright souls, that connection got too much to handle. The shaman had demonstrated, invoking fevered ravings in a tempest-son with the aid of only some powdered herbs. Then he had reversed the ailment with...
    
    The captain was old, and his memories of youth were distorted. Still, he did his best to copy the gestures and words the shaman had taught him so many years ago. Initially, the treatment seemed to do nothing. But as minutes passed, he felt the fever begin to abate. Eddis braved another feathery touch and replaced the confusion and fear he found there with peace. And, almost half an hour after her initial collapse, Daya groaned and woke up.
    
    Hot, achey, and powerfully disoriented, she was not the only person to suffer such symptoms in the Sibdael system. Many other ships reported similar fits from people of all species and ages, all of them immediately falling ill just before Amira Station’s evacuation had been announced. Most had recovered. Some had not, mostly those who were already elderly or infirm. In all, maybe one in every ten million people in the system had been suddenly struck down, though the reported numbers were much lower.
    
    Official explanations were slow in coming. But one man knew right away.

    <em>Scene 49</em>
    Zaes clutched the red crystal heart as he felt something <em>snap</em> in the core of the star, so far away that light itself couldn’t convey information that quickly. An instant later, he grunted and fell to his knees under a distant psychic assault. Sensations washed across the system and resonated in his blood, nearly causing him to collapse. For a brief moment, Zaes feared his tired old body would give out and that would be that. An inglorious end to a decades-long search.
    
    “... No,” he forced out, gripping the heart and willing it to life.
    
    Skin split and a trickle of red mixed with silver flowed from his palm into the heart. His glow dimmed and the heart’s grew stronger. The psychic scream - the last breaths of a dying star - grew faint in his awareness as the heart did his bidding. Waves of agony, terror, and hatred parted around him like a slanted post in the path of a waterfall. He composed himself and stood again, slowing the drain of blood into the heart as the scream quieted down.
    
    “... So fragile,” he breathed. “I hadn’t expected the balance to be quite so delicate.”
    
    The man stared out at the sun again, taking in what he had just done. “After so much work, I still know so little. Who would have known that attempting to force a connection would be enough to overcome the stasis?” Another pause; he stemmed the flow of blood entirely and reversed it for a moment, using the heart to seal the wound he had just created. “I imagine Lee will shortly hear that the situation has deteriorated. He will require my directions; further experimentation will have to wait.”
    
    Another glance back.
    
    “... Soon. When the field has completely failed, the connection will work. I am certain.”

And with the supernova’s explosion able to cross from the sun to Sibdael II faster than the cruiser could spool its hyperdrive, Zaes ordered an immediate full charge of the drive core. He stopped just short of ordering the jump itself.
    
    No need to be too hasty, after all.
    
    ...
    
    “Where’s Euvi?” Ellie asked, noticing that the bridge only had three people in it now.
    
    Mel and Honar both shrugged - or, in Honar’s case, made the equivalent grull gesture that involved significantly more elbow movement. Ellie’s translator took care of the details in any case; another benefit of the exocortex model over the one that did audio-only. She hardly even noticed the different physical actions.
    
    “Well, can someone go track her down? I don’t want her running around in the ship messing with things. Honar, would you mind? I need Mel here for navigation.”
    
    “I will go.” He stood up, nearly brushing the ceiling, and lumbered out of the room.
    
    “You don’t actually need me for navigation,” Mel commented after Honar had left and the door closed again. “We’re literally stationary right now; you could easily program the next jump yourself.”
    
    “Yeah, but I wanted to talk to you. I actually know where Euvi is, too; I sent her to go hide while you two were distracted.”
    
    Mel blinked, surprised. “Sneaky, but why? Do you not trust Honar?”
    
    “No, I do, but I don’t really trust his boss.”
    
    “Ellie, you’ve hated Zaes ever since we first met him.”
    
    “Yeah, but listen, I have a reason this time.”
    
    Mel waited, willing to listen.

So, the research data we found. I looked through it, obviously, and I don’t like what I saw. Honar was saying how it could help bring people back to life, but I’m not seeing that at all. I’m no scientist, but I’m no idiot, and I saw some really dangerous stuff in there. And when you combine it with the fact that Zaes <em>still</em> has that damn Aesop prototype, I’m actually worried about what he’s planning.”
    
    “What did you find?”
    
    “He was asking about things called ‘yhvra’ and crystal hearts, right? So the core observation people were studying the core of the star, and apparently they found a bunch of solid, actual crystal hearts in the middle of the fusion zone. You know, the place where everything is so hot it’s all plasma?”
    
    “... I’m not sure how that’s possible, but go on.”
    
    “I only skimmed most of this stuff so I don’t know how they figured it out, but apparently the hearts have some sort of intelligence, can be shot out of the star onto planets, and are capable of both manipulating matter and ‘bonding’ to people.”
    
    “Are you saying that stars are... alive?”
    
    “Maybe? I don’t know, but I’ve been thinking about these apparently super-powerful star hearts that have <em>minds</em> and Zaes’s secret master plan and he has the mind-control Aesop and... you get what I’m sorta getting at?”
    
    “‘Zaes is trying to enslave the stars,’ is what I would say if I were jumping to conclusions. Which I’m not.”
    
    Ellie let out a breath of relief. “Good, you <em>do</em> get what I’m getting at. I don’t know if I believe it either, but this kind of thing is so far beyond me that I just don’t know if giving it to Zaes is a good idea. I mean, remember when I wondered if maybe this whole thing was to try and cover up the research data so no one could get it? Maybe they found out something so crazy about these hearts that they decided to blow up the entire star - sort of - to hide it? I mean, I haven’t even gone through all the stuff <em>we stole</em>, and there was so much more we didn’t take!”

Maybe ask a few of my contacts to weigh in on how plausible or dangerous this information could be.” She rubbed her eyes. “This whole thing is just so <em>big</em> and we don’t know enough about what’s going on.”
    
    “Makes you kinda wish for the good old days. Things were simple back then: a target, a thing to steal, and that’s it. No galactic conspiracies about living stars.”
    
    “You said - huh?” Mel glanced over, interrupted by the scope as a ship suddenly jumped into the system. Two more quickly followed, then another. “Uhh...”
    
    Ellie slid over to the controls on her side, then made a rapid decision and shut down everything except life support. Lights, engines, and sensors all went dead, leaving the two of them in almost-complete darkness. Only the distant yellow star that formed the center of this planetless system trickled in a low level of illumination through the main window. There was a crash from somewhere in the ship, presumably as Honar or Euvi ran into something in the sudden darkness.
    
    “What?!” Mel hissed, lowering her voice instinctively as if it would carry across the vacuum to whoever they were hiding from.
    
    Ellie carefully chose a few select systems to re-enable, turning the internal lights back on along with passive sensors. “Noisy” systems, like active scanners and engines, were left off. The scope reactivated, though with a massive delay now that the FTL scanners were offline. “Look,” she said at a normal volume, definitely aware that they couldn’t be heard outside of the ship. “There are at least twenty ships there, and all of those suckers look military.”
    
    “So? The Feds are sending in more ships; what about it? We’re not their target.”

We’ve got a group of nearly two dozen heavy military ships that don’t seem to have any registration, all realigning here and preparing to jump into a system that’s about to explode. You want to tell me what the <em>hell</em> they’re doing?”
    
    Honar shoved open the bridge doors, which Ellie had forgotten to re-power. “What is going on? Lights off; engines off?”
    
    “C’mere, pal, and tell me what you make of this fleet...”

    <em>Scene 50</em>
    Euvi lay on the carpeted floor, curled up and hiding behind the low bed. She could hear the large man stomping around looking for her, but didn’t move. The important woman had said to stay put until he found her. So she did. It was a nice carpet, at least. Soft and deep and warmed from underneath by some sort of subfloor heating. A nice bedroom too, relatively spacious and with an actual walk-in closet.
    
    Starships were new to her, but Euvi couldn’t help but try to reconcile her old image of them as cramped, utilitarian transport vessels with this new image of a ship so large and luxurious she could happily live here. And of course, it seemed the two important humans did.
    
    The lights shut off with an audible click, throwing her into complete darkness. Much of the ship’s internal machinery slowed to a halt, leaving nothing to distract her from the near-total silence. Something crashed in the distance, accompanied by muttered curse words, then faster stomping footsteps back towards the bridge.
    
    The lights clicked back on after a minute and, since no one had found her yet, Euvi stayed put. She supposed maybe this was just a thing that starships did sometimes, like how the station had to shut its lights off every night. Starships must be way more efficient, then, since it only took this one a minute to do what took the station hours. She didn’t really know the point of the cycles besides some nebulous notion of cleaning and maintenance, so maybe something like that happened here too. Probably with fewer killer robots, though.
    
    Muffled conversation from the bridge, nearly inaudible through several doors and corridors. After a few moments, the noise dropped significantly to the point where Euvi couldn’t hear them anymore over the gentle hum of fans and pumps from the walls.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1079965994908389476 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1079965994908389476><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="27-Feb-23 10:19 PM">22:19</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>It was comforting, to be surrounded by machinery calmly serving its intended purpose. The Outside was so large and strange, with space and starships and complicated conspiracies to worry about, that it was nice to know it wasn’t <em>that</em> different from the station itself. At least, not everywhere.
    
    Euvi sat up, figuring that no one was currently bothering to come find her. The room was still mostly dark, but glows from little safety lights along the walls let her see without too much trouble. So much had changed in the last few days. Only a week ago, her life’s goal was to speak to another person. That was it. Now, she had not only spoken to <em>many</em> people, but had left Amira Station entirely and was likely to never come back. She had helped catch a saboteur, participated in a gunfight, and watched someone die right in front of her eyes. Everything was just moving so <em>fast.</em>
    
    She shuffled over to the little nightstand on this side of the bed, peering over the top with a slight recovery of the curiosity she still felt. A little lamp (built into the table), a few circular indents that surely served some unknown purpose, and a tightly bound collection of flexible pages. Euvi picked up the book and examined it, flipping through but unable to read any of the words. There was at least a picture on the front, depicting a man and a woman locking swords in the midst of a presumably dangerous fight. Rain shrouded the background and both seemed nude from the waist up, though the angle was such that only the woman’s back was visible.
    
    Euvi wasn’t quite sure what to make of that, so she put the book down and went hunting for more personal artifacts. Now that she was safe and things had calmed down, her curiosity returned. What did people on the Outside do? Wear? Eat? Read? Well, she still wasn’t sure about the reading thing, but she could try to make some progress on the others.
    
    ...
    
    “Ah, so it <em>was</em> you after all.”

Anyway, I know you probably don’t want to trust us, but can you maybe give us a chance? Does getting stabbed for this give me any extra credibility?”
    
    Officer X’deven did not look amused. “You are two of the galaxy’s most notorious criminals, who just so happened to arrive on Amira Station mere minutes before the star suddenly began to detonate. The two of you are currently extremely probable suspects.”
    
    “Oh, come on!” Ellie exclaimed from the other chair. “We <em>helped</em> you this time! Mel got herself <em>stabbed</em> so you could catch your saboteur! What more do you want? A kiss on the cheek?”
    
    He paused for only a moment. “Why are you calling? Do you have further critical information?”
    
    “Er, yes.” Mel tried to get back on track, tapping at the scope. “We jumped out not long ago, to... uh, here.” She sent over the ID of the system, since there was no chance she could pronounce the random string properly.
    
    Ellie interrupted. “And don’t even think about showing up with a cruiser to shoot at us or anything, because we are <em>out</em> of here in like ten minutes tops.”
    
    “R-right. Anyway, a number of unregistered ships arrived shortly after us, jumping in from... this direction. There look to be about twenty to thirty, all military of some description. And they’re all aligning to jump into Sibdael as we speak.”
    
    “The mystery fleet,” X’deven muttered, seemingly willing to humor them for the moment. “I was wondering why we had only seen one attack. Is there anything else?”
    
    Ellie held a button down for a moment before releasing it. A ping flicked up on the scope, followed in quick succession by several dozen more. She glanced over, then turned everything back on. “Yeah. They all jumped out in the literal one minute since I last blipped the scanners. You’ve got maybe ten minutes.”

Who in their right mind would jump <em>into</em> a self-destructing system controlled by a superior force? I sure as hell don’t know, but unless they’re actually nuts, they’re going to have a pretty damn devastating plan.”
    
    “...”
    
    “Officer X’deven.” That was Mel again, leaning a little closer to the screen. “We may be bad guys, but we’re not <em>bad guys</em>. I promise we’re not trying to trick you; we just want to help.”

    <em>Scene 51</em>
    There wasn’t much time left. By the time Ifan reported the conversation and details had moved up to the actual fleet commanders, only minutes remained before the mystery fleet would arrive. Decisions were rushed, orders were given, and many combat-ready ships broke off into defensive screens, ready to repel any assault on the vulnerable civilian craft still frantically working on the last evacuations possible before the sun exploded.
    
    At Amira Station, staff continued to load onto the docked Federation carrier, bouncing through massive umbilicals connecting its various hangar bays to the station’s even larger airgates. Some airgates, further from the carrier, loaded their staff onto smaller regular ships instead; many of these had already evacuated the system. Claril and Gim, both coincidentally near to a hangar when the evacuation alarm was sounded, were by now already in hyperspace on their way out of the system. Safe, and with no time to spare.
    
    Maintenance was no longer possible and all crews had been recalled already. Those unlucky enough to still be stranded in the station’s interior piled into elevators and started the hour-long journey back up to the surface, hoping against hope that the field would hold long enough for them to reach safety. At this distance from the sun, when it finally blew, Amira Station would be obliterated in mere seconds. There would be no chance for any remaining ships to react, plot a course, and jump away if they waited; everyone remaining now did so at their own peril.

Jin and several other volunteers from the monitoring staff remained at their posts, providing real time data as the field’s cohesion ticked down and more flares made it out into the wider system. Emitter spires fried themselves with their own heat trying to contain the star, while uncontrolled jets of plasma vaporized other portions of the station’s sun-facing side.
    
    Somewhere deep within, millions of ghosts continued about their daily business without any inkling of what was happening outside. Few people involved in the evacuation even knew they were there, and even fewer cared. Ifan spared a moment to consider them, but he knew there was nothing he - or anyone else - could do. Not at this point.
    
    Somewhere above Sibdael II, Ifan had been transferred from evacuation duty to defensive patrol. He hovered idle near a line of other Federation craft screening a grouping of bulk freighters as the large, heavy ships began to spool in preparation for a jump. Only moments remained before the mystery fleet was due to arrive. Val called him again.
    
    “Ifan, there is something very fishy going on here.”
    
    “No surprises there. What has you concerned at the moment? The many criminals we let go free today? The mystery fleet? The supernova itself? The probe data?”
    
    She shook her head; since Ifan would be in his ship for the immediate future, he could do a video call without issue. “Probe data’s due in like five minutes, and I’m sure that’ll only make things worse. But no, right now I’m trying to get ahold of a guy called Ro Kimo and he isn’t answering his phone.”
    
    “And this is a problem because...?”
    
    “Kimo’s the senator who told me about the mystery fleet in the first place! Osabruglis, remember?”
    
    “Not really. He could just be busy at the moment.”

Your second set of criminals said 20-30 ships, all smaller than cruiser size, but Kimo indicated over 50 ships, all cruiser-sized or larger. And then we’ve <em>actually</em> only seen those three destroyers, once. Just how big is this fleet?”
    
    “If you wait roughly one more minute, we’ll find out.” Ifan peeked down at the scope; still nothing.
    
    “Alright... I just really think Lynran was right. You don’t jump into a system about to go supernova and also occupied by a superior force without one <em>hell</em> of a plan. Command went defensive, but I think that’s too much the ‘normal’ thing to do. Like, they’d <em>expect</em> us to do that, right?”
    
    Beeps from the scope. “Hold, please.” Ifan watched many signatures spill onto the screen, then slow down. Three groups: one by Amira Station, one by Sibdael II, and one by Sibdael III. Maybe 30 ships in total, with most of them concentrated towards Sibdael II, then Amira Station, and finally Sibdael III. Matching the Federation’s deployment; unsurprising. None of the ships registered as cruisers, lending a bit of extra credibility towards Alborn’s report.
    
    Val was clearly seeing the same thing even from Gamma Veox. “See? Where are the cruisers?”
    
    “Not here, clearly.” Ifan charged weapons, preparing to defend against the assault force; several of the enemy ships were only a few hundred kilometers away. “Now, please be quiet. I need to focus on the battle.”
    
    Val, blessedly, actually shut up.
    
    ... At least for a few minutes. “Why aren’t they doing anything?” she asked, biting her lip nervously. “They’re just spreading out; not advancing.”
    
    “... I don’t like this.” Some Federation officer spoke on the other channel, ordering ships to maintain position.
    
    Minutes passed in tense silence, then Val spoke up again. “Got the probe data, by the way. Interested, or too distracted?”
    
    “Let me hear it.”

Someone in this ‘completely uncharted’ system has some serious orbital defenses.”
    
    “We’re paying that system a visit after this,” he stated harshly. “In force.”
    
    “Some of the people upstairs are working on that already. I bet we know where those missing executives went now.”
    
    Someone interrupted on the other channel again; a voice dripping with fear and belonging to one of the freighter captains. “Sorry to bother you all, but we’re having some issues with our hyperdrive... I know we were supposed to jump out minutes ago, but it just isn’t engaging properly; we don’t yet know what’s wrong.”
    
    Silence on the link for several seconds.
    
    Then a different freighter chimed in. “Us - us too.”
    
    A third. Fourth. Before long, the officer from before had to restrict the link due to the flood of chatter regarding hyperdrive problems. Ifan felt an electric chill of anxiety constrict his hair strands as he engaged his own jump drive. It struggled for only a moment before giving up and presenting a generic error code.
    
    “Val,” he gasped, as if she could do anything to help. “What is going on?”

    <em>Scene 52</em>
    “I - I don’t know-”
    
    “When was the last time someone jumped out? Before those ships showed up?” Thankfully, his console had a log of recent history and he could pinpoint the last nearby outgoing jump event: roughly thirty seconds before the mystery fleet had arrived. Nothing since.
    
    He switched to the other channel. “The enemy ships must have something to do with this; we need to attack immediately. There’s no time to just sit here - clearly they <em>want</em> us to do that.”
    
    Another tense delay as other officers considered his words. Ifan almost started accelerating on his own, but he’d be outgunned without support and would be leaving the others with an incomplete formation. Finally, someone agreed and much of the battlegroup split off towards the enemy fleet. Unfortunately, hyperdrives weren’t only used for full jumps into hyperspace - they also allowed for much faster but still subluminal travel within a system. Without that ability, accelerating took much longer and provided much less control at high speeds due to simple inertia. The thrusters’ force simply had much more effective mass to move.
    
    Still, the signatures didn’t seem to be moving and the battlegroup was gaining on their enemies. Val cut in again, sounding very stressed out. “Ships by Sibdael V and VI aren’t having any issues; people there can jump out just fine. It’s only-”
    
    “Areas where the mystery fleet is?”
    
    “...Yeah.”
    
    He checked the scope again; nearly within range of several signatures, but the computer hadn’t yet gotten a lock. “Working on it. Can you get the rest of the group we left back there to get moving? Try to spread out, at least? Maybe whatever they’re doing is an ongoing thing with a finite range, rather than something that permanently broke the drives.”
    
    “... I hadn’t even considered that second option.”
    
    “Probably better that way. Please go check.”
    
    She went.

Ifan flipped through various sensor views, but everything from visual to radio to the full FTL suite came up empty. Only the transponders registered; the ships themselves were nowhere to be seen, in any type of sight.
    
    “Where the hell are they?” someone else asked, just before Ifan keyed in.
    
    “Invisible?” another pilot wondered. “But why would they leave the transponders on?”
    
    “Stealth systems work the other way; they mask waves but not visuals. We’re plenty close enough for visual cams to pick something up; they just aren’t here!”
    
    “So where ARE they?!”
    
    ...
    
    Zaes stood on the bridge, hands clasped behind his back, gazing out the massive viewport. His crew stood or sat haphazardly behind him, some still monitoring the cruiser’s systems but most simply waiting and praying that he could help them.
    
    He knew the rumors, of course. How he could perform acts of actual, legitimate magic. How he could mind control anyone with just a touch. How he had brought a corpse back to life. Some of the crew - including Captain Lee - had even been present when his first crystal heart exploded on this very bridge. The scorch mark had been scrubbed clean, but sometimes he still caught people glancing at the floor panel where it had been.
    
    Of course, he was not a miracle worker. Zaes had many abilities, but he knew his own limitations. He could not repair their hyperdrive on his own, and he could not propel the cruiser out of the system without the drive. Not fast enough to escape the supernova, at least. So he waited and listened, gathering information about the situation from the many other communication links buzzing through the system.

Zaes almost smirked. Such a mythos had built up around him that many members of his own crew believed he was in a meditative trance at the moment, gazing out the window until he had figured out a solution to the problem. Not so much; he was simply listening to the conversations in his earpiece.
    
    “I understand now,” he murmured, drawing whispers from the crowd. And he did. The invisible ships; the transponders; the pilot who had managed to actually hit a little radio beacon with a few thrusters strapped on and destroy one of the enemy “ships.” Decoys; the lot of them. And what use were decoys if there was nothing to hide...?
    
    “Find them,” he instructed the heart, clasped securely in both hands and hidden from the crew by his body. Blood leaked from him to it and the crystal glinted red as it searched for the emotions he desired. His awareness blossomed throughout the system, propagating from ship to ship and tracing lines between FTL comm buoys. Minds became visible like dim flames in a vast graph, but most of them were faint. Not those he sought.
    
    There. A grouping of emotions different than most in the system. Zaes whispered a brief command to the Aesop device clutched just beneath the heart; the blue sphere flashed, the heart crackled, and a lance of data traveled from him to the ship he had found. Several minds resisted his touch, but one had a flaw. An exocortex, left unpatched for years. Vulnerable to his remote takeover. The woman attached to it flinched, but couldn’t resist his instructions. “Explain how you are blocking hyperspace travel,” he ordered. “Quickly.”
    
    Information returned in short order. His victim was unimportant in the crew and didn’t know the ship’s masters or true purpose. But she did know that it used a prototype interdiction technology and - more crucially - how to turn it off.

    <em>Scene 53</em>
    “Worry not,” he assured the crew. “I have a solution. We can leave once our work here is complete. Captain, keep the drive spooled and ready to jump <em>immediately</em> once I give the word. Everyone else, maintain combat readiness and alert me the very instant that star explodes. I have some additional work to perform...”
    
    ...
    
    “Spread out! Everyone pick a target and go check!”
    
    Ifan accelerated quickly, Sibdael II shrinking behind him as he burned towards his selected signature. Someone by Amira Station had managed to target and destroy one of the enemy “ships” - actually just a radio beacon with some engines strapped on. Decoys. Unfortunately, there wasn’t a good way to tell these decoys apart from the actual ships unless they <em>did</em> something, so the battlegroup simply spread out to check them all.
    
    His target was relatively near, and though he had to close to a much tighter distance than normal, his visual systems eventually managed to pick out the tiny block and calculate a shot. Laser cannons pulsed once and the beacon scattered into a cloud of debris. One down; only a dozen more to go.
    
    As he turned his ship, angling towards a second beacon, Ifan started to wonder. A recent statement echoed in his head; some pilot reminding another how <em>normal</em> stealth systems worked. In general, you could become near-invisible to active sensors from other ships by shutting off your own systems, then keeping any remaining heat generated trapped inside the hull instead of venting it to space. That was the “normal” way to hide. These decoys were effective, but now that they had figured it out, the game would be up. The real ships would be discovered in only moments, so why weren’t any of them moving? Powering up? Trying to escape or fight back?
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1082121130455863386 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1082121130455863386><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="05-Mar-23 09:03 PM">21:03</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Well, maybe because they were <em>all</em> decoys. Why not simply hide the real ships in actual stealth, leaving only the radio beacons to draw fire? It made sense. The only problem was that, if correct, Ifan had <em>no</em> idea where the actual ships were. They could be hiding anywhere nearby, like needles in a stack full of toothpicks spray-painted with metal. An awkward simile, sure, but he was pretty stressed out at the moment.
    
    Calls confirming more decoys destroyed came in from other members of the battlegroup as Ifan struggled with his hypothesis, trying to come up with some way to trace an invisible ship. Unfortunately, common knowledge was that you couldn’t, unless you were close enough to actually see them. That was the <em>point</em> of stealth systems! Sure, his automated cameras could help so he didn’t have to rely on his own eyes, but they only had so much resolution - they couldn’t pick out a tiny black speck against a black background much better than he could.
    
    It seemed an impossible problem, unless he got incredibly lucky. Maybe that was his best option - his <em>only</em> option. Just pick a sector, fly in, and hope to god he picked the right one. <em>What else could he do?</em>
    
    ...
    
    Amira Station held its dying breath.
    
    The station was empty now - well, mostly, if you discounted the ghosts - and the remaining Federation and refugee ships burned full speed away from the sun. Hyperdrives remained spooled, but couldn’t be engaged. Anyone who tried lost the entire charge and couldn’t start a new spool; this information had been quickly disseminated so the majority of the fleet still held fully ready drives. All they needed was...

The entire enemy fleet was nothing but decoys. The actual ships must be hiding elsewhere; nearby. Frantic patrols searched sector by sector, running visual sweeps here and there with every available craft. There was a flurry of excitement as a rookie fighter pilot actually found one, burying several missiles into the enemy hull before it could reactivate its shields.
    
    The sleek, dark destroyer erupted in a flare of deep purple light, causing hyperdrives nearby to flicker. One particularly old and unlucky freighter’s core actually destabilized entirely and the craft detonated, vaporized from the inside by a burst of superluminal white radiance. Elated, several ships were chosen to try to jump. Maybe that was it; maybe that was the only one.
    
    It wasn’t. One of the six ships dipped into hyperspace and left the system, but the other five stayed right where they were. A few more attempts led to a wing of roughly three dozen craft managing to jump out; the rest of the fleet began to burn towards that region of space where it seemed salvation might lie.
    
    The station’s dying breath could be held no longer. One more segment of the stasis field shattered, and that was it. The sun erupted. The field broke.
    
    The star Sibdael became a supernova.
    
    There’s no such thing as a “normal” supernova, but there are some typical timelines. Often, due to the enormous distances involved, it will take a star several minutes or even hours to collapse inwards before beginning to erupt back out. Then, it can take even longer to scour its former solar system clean of life before rolling outwards in a wave of steadily-weakening destruction.

The stasis field had not so much <em>paused</em> time, but rather <em>delayed</em> it. Mere instants after the field broke, the star boiled through the end of its lifecycle at essentially the speed of light. It crashed down into its compressed form in a matter of seconds, spraying a deluge of exotic matter into space due to the unbelievably immense forces involved, then erupted into its final stellar explosion at roughly the same speed.
    
    Amira Station was destroyed with no fanfare; simply consumed by the ballooning supergiant wave of plasma and more unusual forms of energy. Millions of ghosts perished in an instant, most never having known why. At the same time, the FTL comm buoys tethered to the station also met their ends, cutting off their final transmissions of energy readings spiking far past the scale.
    
    The supernova rolled on, still moving only slightly slower than light itself. FTL sensors screamed in alarm, warning pilots of imminent death encroaching and to jump immediately, but there was nothing that could be done. Even if the last interdictor had been destroyed - for there had only been one more at the station, without a single exocortex-equipped crew member for Dr Zaes to control - even then, the onrushing gravity of the expanding star made superluminal travel impossible anyway.
    
    The entire remaining fleet at Amira Station - from the largest supercarrier to the smallest one-person fighter - was swallowed by the sun. A fraction of a second later, the interdictor destroyer was consumed as well. Over a hundred fully charged jump drives detonated inside the supernova, adding superluminal particles and formerly-unknown forms of supercharged firmlight residue to the onrushing wave of death. The star didn’t slow down; if anything, it sped up, with some portions of its mass dipping into hyperspace to arrive before the very light carrying this information.

    <em>Scene 54</em>
    Dr Zaes felt the star’s death like a physical blow, and he wasn’t alone. Across the system, the very same people who had recently been afflicted with a mysterious aching fever simultaneously cried out, pressing hands to temples or whatever other anatomical features provided analogous functionality.  Fevers returned in full force, and in three very rare cases, the victims actually spontaneously combusted, falling to the floor in a burning heap.
    
    In more typical cases, symptoms were more similar to the previous affliction, though with the addition of spontaneous bleeding from various sensory organs. Several onlookers were shocked to see traces of flickering silver mixing with the various colors of human and alien blood.
    
    Zaes grunted, but he was ready this time and kept himself upright through the heart and sheer force of will. This was what he had been waiting for, and he couldn’t simply fall unconscious now. Instead, he clasped the heart to his own chest, breathed deeply, and <em>listened.</em>
    
    Nothing...
    
    Nothing...
    
    A connection.
    
    For a fleeting instant, he <em>was</em> the star. Astral energy flowed between Sibdael’s core, the crystal heart in his grasp, and his own mind. Images; knowledge; traces of feelings and places and schemes beyond any reality currently known. Uncountable groves of serene, silver-white trees standing tall under a blank white sky. A city half-submerged in perfectly transparent, depthless water, its buildings formed only of shimmering outlines. A molten, burning heat and a flight of near-translucent steps leading up to it. Golden light mixing with silver, flaring and melting and spitting hateful sparks to the skies above.
    
    Golden. Death. Silver. Decay.
    
    This was what the star knew.

Some infinitesimal fragment of the red crystal heart - a sliver of its mind shattered so long ago - stirred into a momentary alertness. It cried out and the dead star Sibdael answered. There was a sensation of immense pressure, unbearable heat, and a brilliant silver glow.
    
    Zaes dropped the heart.
    
    He clutched his left hand and fell to his knees, almost screaming against the horrible burning pain. His palm was scorched black; flakes of flesh crumbled off as he moved. The rest of his body was aflame with knowledge and... something else. Something more. The crystal heart before him had regained its luster, shimmering powerfully from within with a roiling orange-red glow.
    
    Crew members shouted in alarm and ran to his aid, some rushing for a doctor. Zaes waved them away; shouting in a croaking voice that echoed to his ears. “No time! Where is-” He spotted the Aesop device - one of the galaxy’s greatest superweapons - rolling merrily across the floor and under a desk. “Fetch me the orb, immediately!”
    
    Someone scrambled to obey, snatching up the Aesop and returning it to Zaes. The heart glowed brightly, promising power, but the sun would be upon them in a matter of minutes. No time. A doctor arrived, but Zaes waved him aside as well. “Not now! When - when we are in hyperspace.” His ears rang and the room shifted unsteadily. <em>I am going to pass out,</em> he realized. Too much stress placed on his body. His hand was almost totally numb. <em>Going into shock. Need to... hurry.</em>
    
    The Aesop was still connected. “Captain! Prepare to... jump.” His thoughts moved slowly. The doctor had stolen his left hand and was leading him towards a chair. Captain Lee responded, saying something that sounded like one of them was underwater. “And... tell the Federation to jump as soon as we do. Ready?”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1082828206752661544 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1082828206752661544><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="07-Mar-23 07:52 PM">19:52</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>He waited nearly five precious seconds for Lee to indicate readiness, head spinning and vision beginning to grey out. Then, he spoke to the Aesop. “Disable the interdiction fields as permanently as you can. Right now.”
    
    Three living crew members and one dead, fried exocortex whose atoms had been essentially reduced to quarks by the supernova scrambled to do his bidding. In moments, three ships had lowered their fields. “Go!” he shouted, then fell unconscious.
    
    The cruiser accelerated, its twin jump drives already straining against the incoming supernova’s gravitational pull, then pierced into hyperspace and was gone. Over the next ten seconds, dozens of quick-acting Federation and refugee ships around Sibdael II, including the other enormous supercarrier, jumped out as well. Unfortunately, not everyone managed to escape before the interdictors reasserted their fields, restraining or killing their turncoat crew members.
    
    ...
    
    Ifan swore as reports came in from other ships, confirming what he had suspected: that the interruption of the interdiction field had only been temporary. He had no idea how the Lockheed-Bolte cruiser had managed to buy them even that much time, and didn’t begrudge anyone who had managed to take the opportunity to escape. Above all else, the departure of the enormous carrier signaled a massive victory and a huge number of lives saved, even though it had left behind over half of its non-hyperspace capable fighters to do so.
    
    His own hyperdrive hummed disconcertingly as it spooled. He had managed to engage it in the brief window of clearance, though it would still need several more minutes to charge and couldn’t be activated without the interdiction field coming down again. Still, he was in a much better position than mere moments ago, with the drive completely offline. His chances of survival had gone up from “zero” to “very unlikely.”

Val? Running? With her legs? He couldn’t help but fixate on minor questions with that damn sun so close behind. “It’s in hyperspace. The supernova. You won’t even see it coming-”
    
    He checked the rear cameras. Sibdael <em>had</em> started to expand, but it still looked relatively far away. His hyperdrive, however, told a different story. Little warnings began to pop up, cautioning him about a nearby massive gravitational object and to apply discretion when jumping. “The field is still up,” he said with surprising composure. “I can’t get out.”
    
    “The interdictors; if you can just find them before-” She cut off again, followed by a muttered exclamation and an “I’m fine!” from Val.
    
    “We’re all looking, but haven’t found anything yet. I’m scanning deep space, hoping they were hiding against the background-” A loud crash filtering through the mic made him flinch and he changed gears. “What are you doing? Are you okay?”
    
    “Oww...” Some more muttered conversation, then a series of rustling noises. Finally, Val picked up again. “Sometimes I really hate my useless goddamn legs; you know that?” Before he could respond, she corrected herself. “Er, not my legs; my useless goddamn nerves. Or just my stupid desire to at least try the stairs before admitting I need help.”
    
    “Where are you going?”
    
    “There’s a... some sort of security threat in the Senate building. I’m sure it’s nothing, but I had to evacuate with everyone else and - wouldn’t you know it - there’s a lot of stairs involved.”
    
    “You can’t be serious that you think it’s nothing. Your wiretap? The <em>timing?</em>”
    
    “Look, Ifan, <em>please</em> don’t worry about me right now. Just get <em>yourself</em> to safety right now. Okay?”

Far enough spooled to jump somewhere, at least, but probably still in the field based on the uneven humming from the core. Plus, the supernova’s gravity was still encroaching fast and no one had found any of the interdictors yet. “To be perfectly honest, I’m not sure I can get out of this one.”
    
    “You have to try! Just...” Val was silent for a moment and he could picture her, eyes squeezed shut as she furiously worked through possible solutions. “Get as far away from the sun as possible!”
    
    “That’s your-”
    
    “Shut up! It’s so simple - just get far enough away that by the time the interdictor gets destroyed by the sun, you’re still clear of the gravity well and can jump.”
    
    “But if I do that, I can’t help anyone else escape. I’m already the furthest one out.”
    
    “Ifan, you self-martyring idiot, get the HELL out of there! I don’t outrank you, but that’s a goddamn order anyway!”

    <em>Scene 55</em>
    “...”
    
    He considered the option; he truly did. Sat there, still tearing across space at a terrific speed searching for the last interdictors, and asked himself how much he was willing to sacrifice to save others. Even if he stayed, he could still - potentially - escape if he was lucky. And there was no total guarantee he would be safe even if he followed Val’s plan.
    
    But deep down, he knew the risks. He knew which option would likely result in him surviving - but abandoning everyone remaining in the system to the supernova. And he knew which option... likely would not.
    
    “I’m sorry, Val. I can’t leave them behind. Not when there’s even a chance I can help so many people escape.”
    
    He couldn’t see her - the video call had ended when she had to leave the Senate building - but he could hear her desperation. No trace of her usual energy or lightheartedness; Val was <em>begging</em> him. “Ifan, <em>please.</em> Know when to retreat. You can fight back against the people who did this later. We’ll need your help. <em>I’ll</em> need your help. Just... don’t throw yourself away.”
    
    Ifan almost broke then - one hand twitched towards the flight controls - but he held himself back. Maybe if he could have seen her tears or her messy, anguished expression, things would have been different. But he couldn’t, and his hand didn’t move. “I’ll meet you back on Gamma Veox in a few days, and I’ll bring the rest of this fleet along for the ride.”
    
    And then, because he knew he wouldn’t be able to stick to his decision if she kept this up, he ended the call and turned off extra-system comms. Just for a few minutes, he told himself. He’d turn them back on within the hour. After he saved the day and jumped out of the system.

Anxiety rose, followed by panic, though Ifan managed to suppress much of it to stay generally levelheaded. Eventually, a transmission came in from another member of the battlegroup, stating they had found and destroyed one interdictor in the orbit of Sibdael II itself. Not enough; the field was still active. There were more.
    
    And then, quite suddenly, it was too late. The hyperdrive’s warnings became alerts, stating he was now too close to a massive gravitational body to initiate a jump. With the supernova moving faster than light, there was absolutely no way he could escape its gravity without the jump drive, and he couldn’t use the jump drive without escaping its gravity - even if the interdiction field were destroyed.
    
    It was over.
    
    Sibdael II, the remaining fleet around it, and the last two interdictors were all devoured by the expanding sun within seconds of each other. Ifan’s hyperdrive flickered and stopped humming so loudly, but gravity was still too strong.
    
    He tried it anyway. There was no reason not to, right?
    
    Modern hyperdrives have layers upon layers of safety protocols designed to stop any end user from activating them within a strong gravitational field, but there is nothing <em>physically</em> stopping the drive from engaging even in such extreme circumstances. The odds are trillions to one that anything will happen other than a messy destabilization followed by a superluminal explosion, but that “one” case <em>does</em> exist. And if you happen to have a jailbroken set of hyperdrive safety protocols like Ifan, you too can roll the dice.

The universe faded towards insubstantiality; distant stars blurred into streaks of light. Screeching metal distorted and tore. The rear cameras were entirely whited out - sensors utterly destroyed - by the roaring wall of plasma expanding through hyperspace and realspace alike. Shields broke, hull plating sublimated, and still the ship fought to make headway against the howling maelstrom behind.
    
    In a sudden instant, the drive core detonated in a burst of brilliant white light. What little remained was quickly absorbed into the supernova.
    
    The “one” case does exist, but so do the other trillions. And in this instant, like so many others, the dice didn’t come up exactly right.
    
    ...
    
    Val sat huddled against a metal pillar in a train station somewhere in the city of Veox Astra, clutching her phone with one hand and willing Ifan to call back. Her legs still trembled with the strain of trying to descend so many stairs and her cheek still throbbed from where she had fallen during the attempt. She couldn’t walk, at least not until her legs calmed down.
    
    Senator Entrone hovered nervously nearby, alternating between making sure Val wasn’t somehow dying and checking in with the group of other staffers nearby. She appreciated his concern - he had even tried to help carry her before discovering his physique wasn’t up to the task for very long.
    
    Senator Dmyoti also stood nearby, talking animatedly with another gauruvian wearing mechanized body armor. The steel-scaled senator was the one who had actually carried Val down several flights of stairs and onto the train during the evacuation. Now he was demanding to know what was going on and what the military was doing about it.
    
    She found it kind of hard to care, staring at her blank phone screen and seeing only her own miserable face reflected back.

    “- Getting reports of an exchange of gunfire within the Galactic Senate building itself,” the anchor was saying, standing several blocks away in front of a police barricade. “And I believe we are just hearing that... yes, one suspect has been killed by Federation soldiers.” He put one hand to his ear, nodding along with some distant prompt. “And they appear to have recovered an undetonated explosive device. Remember that only one suspect has so far been sighted, so we might be out of the woods, folks. I repeat: no fatalities reported; one suspect killed; explosives undetonated and recovered. More information as the situation develops.”
    
    “Dmyoti,” Val called, her voice still scratchy from her previous crying. “Here.”
    
    ...
    
    “We’re living in a goddamn fairytale,” Ellie complained, sifting through the reports Mel had gathered and synthesized from her contacts. “Seriously; stars with minds, blood made of silver, just literal fucking magic?” She leaned back, tilting her head to lock eyes with Mel, upside down. “It’s crazy. Just absolutely fucking insane. Am I getting through to you how much of a hard time I’m having?”
    
    Mel smiled gently, lowering her paper book for a moment. A very rare copy of an millennia-old text that their contact Mips just <em>had</em> for some reason, its cover was deep red leather with a depiction of a golden triangle inscribed in a circle. “I can tell; you’re swearing a lot more than normal.”

And why do half of these talk about those hearts Zaes is so excited about like they’re the greatest thing ever and the other half like they’re actual demons?” She paused. “Wait, no, ‘demons’ are an entirely different fucking thing according to your little book there! I’m losing my mind, Mel. Seriously; none of this can possibly be real. We’re just doing research on old mythology and religions for our crackpot doctor now. None of this shit <em>works</em>.”
    
    “Well, not that there’s evidence of since the Federation was formed, at least,” she agreed. “But it’s fascinating nonetheless. Aren’t you <em>curious</em> about what happened to Old Earth? All these tidbits from the past can tell us so much, even if the actual ‘magic’ isn’t real.”
    
    “... I guess it’s kinda fun.”
    
    Mel nudged Ellie with her foot, the only part that could reach as they sat across the room from each other. “So, if everything in here is just old myths and legends, and Dr Zaes is a crackpot nutcase, it won’t do any harm to give him the full data, right? Then we get paid, he gets what he wants, and you don’t have to get upset about lying to Honar.”
    
    “Wha - I - upset about -???”
    
    “I <em>knowww</em> you.”
    
    Ellie fumbled for a few more moments, searching for something to say, before somewhat lamely ending up with “You sure do.”

    <em>Epilogue</em>
    <em>Weeks after the supernova...</em>
    
    “Fuck you, Zaes,” Ellie said politely, nodding to the scientist as he stood to greet them.
    
    “Good afternoon,” he responded. “Pleasant trip, I hope?”
    
    Mel entered next, shaking his hand instead of swearing at him. “Pretty boring, but boring is good these days. We’re trying to stay out of the whole outer spiral... <em>thing</em> right now.”
    
    He nodded, gesturing for the two of them to follow him. “Good, good. I agree; bad for everyone involved. My employer is, of course, heavily invested, but my projects are staying as clear as possible.”
    
    Mel and Zaes continued to make small talk as they walked, so Ellie took some time to look around. The scientist himself didn’t seem any worse for wear after his hospitalization, though he did still wear a brace and light glove on his left hand where - she had been told - he had suffered a terrible burn. Aside from that, he looked basically the same. Kinda tall, kinda willowy, with thin silver hair and unnervingly keen eyes.
    
    The facility was new, however. They were walking through recently constructed composite-paneled hallways in a lab located on a dead moon orbiting an equally dead planet, itself orbiting some horrifically out-of-the-way blue-white star named Nitar by some lone explorer centuries ago. The whole place held a muffled undertone of some vague chemical smell. Still, the presence of the lab itself meant that Lockheed-Bolte still saw value in whatever Zaes was doing. The man could do many things on his own, but constructing a brand new state-of-the-art laboratory on a mostly-uncharted moon was beyond even him... right? Well, it wouldn’t hurt to ask.
    
    Ellie wedged herself back into the conversation. “So, Zaes, what’s your lab doing all the way out here? Did L-B want you somewhere distant so if you blow yourself up, you’re not going to take anything else with you?”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084268222167121950 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084268222167121950><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Mar-23 07:14 PM">19:14</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Essentially, yes.” Ellie blinked, a little taken aback, as he continued. “I have started to deliver some useful concepts and materials, and the board was both impressed and wary. We mutually agreed that my experiments could use a little... privacy. Much less danger to everyone than operating out of the back rooms of a night club, yes?”
    
    “... Yeah.”
    
    “Speaking of L-B,” Mel noted, nodding towards an occupied room as they passed. “I’m surprised you have any actual staff here. I thought your research was so secret you were keeping it to just yourself.”
    
    “Unfortunately, there is too much to do and too little of my own time. Everyone here is carefully selected and not allowed any communication outside of the system. As you may have noticed, there are no open comm buoys anywhere nearby - the only ones on the moon are locked down within this facility.” He stopped at a heavy door, then leaned down to tap a keycard and submit to a palm scan. “Regardless, here we are.”
    
    The lab here was dominated by an enormous, hulking telescope and associated display console. Loops of glowing, silvery liquid entered the machine from the floor, then exited to the right side with their glow extinguished. A low, bass hum vibrated the air constantly; Ellie felt an uncomfortable twisting sensation somewhere around her stomach.
    
    Honar was here too, wearing fuzzy earmuffs and working at a console on the left side of the room. He looked up as they entered, gave a wide grin and a smile, then ambled over. “Boss! And hunters! It is about time you are showing up.”
    
    “That is a <em>striking</em> fashion statement.” Ellie pointed at the earmuffs. “You go, pal.”
    
    “Ah, for you too.” Honar handed over three more sets of earmuffs from a rack on the wall next to the door. “For the sickness.”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084268298532823100 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084268298532823100><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Mar-23 07:15 PM">19:15</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The hum vanished from perception and the sickening, twisting sensation slowly untangled itself. Ellie breathed out in relief. “Love the designer colors. Zaes, has anyone ever told you that mauve is <em>your</em> color? Seriously, get a matching shirt or something.”
    
    He was used to her antics by this point and merely gestured them further into the room, starting to speak. His voice was only muffled a little by the earmuffs. “This display is connected directly to the large dish you may have noticed flying over the facility on your way in. It is essentially a wide-spectrum telescope designed to make use of materials and processes that we have been designing in this lab for the last several months. And with the data you three recovered for me from Amira Station, I was recently able to calibrate it to start a galaxy-wide scan.”
    
    Honar glanced over at the console. “It still says zero percent, boss.”
    
    “Well, yes. The galaxy has billions of stars to scan, and the telescope can only work so quickly - even with hyperspace optics. I checked this morning and we were roughly a quarter of a thousandth of one percent of the way through. At this rate, it will take over three millennia to complete the task, but I intend to vastly improve the process over the next few years. Or at least add additional telescopes.”
    
    Mel leaned over the main display curiously, watching statistics and points of light scroll down the screen. “What’s it looking for?”
    
    “Gods, Ms Alborn,” Zaes answered simply.
    
    “Uh,” Ellie interjected inquiringly.
    
    “I assume the two of you have done your own investigation on the research materials you delivered, so I will presume you are familiar with the basics of lacre and ichor. The substances classified as blood of gods and demons by old mythologies, colored silver and gold respectively, and capable of producing what was - by the ancients - deemed ‘magic’.”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084268370070863952 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084268370070863952><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Mar-23 07:15 PM">19:15</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Ellie glanced at Mel, who half-nodded and wiggled her hand noncommittally. “Sort of. It’s a fascinating set of beliefs, but there hasn’t been any evidence of this ‘magic’ in modern times.”
    
    Zaes smiled at that, a rare expression on his usually carefully neutral face. “I have managed to produce a substance that behaves much like the old descriptions of lacre, and with it, I have been able to create some very promising technology. This telescope, as you can see by the tubes along the sides, uses that substance as part of its operations.”
    
    Ellie dutifully looked at the silver-glowing liquid, feeling increasingly out of her depth.
    
    “And yet, I have so far entirely failed to produce ichor through any means. After exhaustive research on the subject, I am still no closer to finding a solution. But with the Amira Station data combined with this telescope, I intend to find one.”
    
    Mel put it together. “Blood of gods; you’re searching for gods... to bleed?”
    
    “Roughly.”
    
    “But why do you care so much?” Ellie had to ask, feeling a need to push back against all this occult nonsense. “Why do you need this ichor stuff anyway?”
    
    He turned to face her directly. “On top of the immense technological advancement possible with a substance that behaves as ichor is described?” Ellie nodded, so he continued. “Do you remember what I said when you asked what my ‘game’ was in offering you this mission and tour?”
    
    “... Survival.”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084268447342526524 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084268447342526524><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Mar-23 07:15 PM">19:15</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Precisely.” A deep breath. “I understand it is difficult to take these stories of gods and demons at face value. I personally struggled with believing in my own work, even after performing what I could only describe as magic with my own hands. But from what I have learned, there is a significant and accelerating imbalance in the galaxy - one related to lacre and ichor, and one that could cause an incredible amount of destruction if left unchecked. Worse even than the Sibdael disaster. And so I am searching for a way to slow or stop this cataclysm by locating any gods that may still be alive and learning from them the other half of this puzzle. And if gods must bleed to reveal the secrets of ichor, then so be it. I will kill them myself if that’s what is needed to avert calamity.”
    
    Silence for several seconds.
    
    Finally, Ellie spoke up. “Zaes, you are either completely nuts or amazingly hardcore. Possibly both.”
    
    He sighed, suddenly looking very old and very tired. “Probably both,” he agreed.

    <em>Weeks after the supernova...</em>
    
    Daya sloshed through the shin-high water, sweating profusely in the hot, waterlogged air and constantly swatting away swarms of little flying red creatures that reminded her of mosquitos. According to the captain, they were called laivers and didn’t actually drink blood, but rather ate tiny nibbles of skin. Usually dead cells, but if enough of them got on, they could chew their way down to living tissue and cause some actual damage.
    
    “I’ve changed my mind!” she shouted, wiping hair out of her face to try and see how much farther it would be. “I can do without this ‘quest of spirit and body’ - give me my thermal regulator back!”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084268519476170792 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084268519476170792><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Mar-23 07:15 PM">19:15</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The captain wasn’t too far ahead. He moved quickly for his age, walking confidently through the swamp wearing nothing but a pair of shorts. Somehow he attracted far fewer of the bugs than Daya, who was fully - if lightly - clothed. “You can have it back when we reach the house,” he responded, turning to walk backwards for a bit. “Making your way through the swamp unhindered by assistance from technology helps you become aware of the strengths and limitations of your own body. Plus, it keeps your mind on the here and now.”
    
    “I feel like I’m going to die of heatstroke,” she complained. “And the laivers won’t <em>leave me alone!</em>”
    
    “I told you to wear your lightest outfit,” he chuckled. “They like sweat - something about the minerals, I’m told. That’s why I’m wearing this and always moving to get a breeze.”
    
    “This <em>is</em> my lightest outfit. I packed for space travel, not <em>swamp</em> travel. That’s what the regulator’s for.”
    
    “You know what they say: you can always wear a lighter outfit unless you’re already naked.” A laugh. “But I think one of Hof’s farmhands is about your size; we might be able to get an Ovanoxan outfit for the next leg.”
    
    “If I make it that far.” Daya tugged at the neck of her shirt, considering it. The captain <em>probably</em> wouldn’t make it weird. But she was saved from the decision by a break in the trees finally coming into view.
    
    “Here we are,” the captain said, slowing to let Daya catch up. “My grandson Hof’s farm!”
    
    The farmhouse itself was a two-story wooden building raised somewhat off the submerged ground by way of stilts. A number of auxiliary structures dotted the clearing, housing machinery and storing crops or supplies. A handful of people were visible in the fields, all dressed very similarly to the captain. Some rode large machines along rows of submerged crops, while others walked the fields on foot, examining individual plants.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084268591991500851 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084268591991500851><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Mar-23 07:16 PM">19:16</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Daya suddenly shivered, her skin crackling with electricity and frying a few unlucky laivers. The captain splashed ahead, rushing to hug a muscular, dark-skinned man probably about her age: Hof, presumably. She had come here to learn about the “ancient blood” she supposedly possessed, and as such would be meeting with one of the captain’s shamans tomorrow. She had plenty of doubts about the whole process, but standing here in the swamp and feeling a chill breeze from nowhere in particular... The planet felt open to her. Welcoming, perhaps?
    
    Nearby haze thickened and Hof glanced at the sky, talking with the captain. He then called over to her. “Hey, Daya! Looks like it’s about to rain; come on over so we can get inside. Storms on Ovanox are nothing to take lightly.”
    
    She blinked, feeling the muggy heat return along with the bugs. Shouted back - “Coming!” - and hurried through the outlying rows of the farm towards the promise of a shower, her thermal regulator back, and possibly - hopefully - some answers.
    
    ...
    
    <em>Days after the supernova...</em>
    
    “They’re calling themselves the Outer Spiral Systems Alliance,” Val said to the assembled senators. “The main governing body seems to be led by ex-Sibdael officials, but there are plenty of other systems who have signed onto this pact far too quickly - the Sibdael people were definitely working with other systems before the supernova. So far, there are roughly four dozen systems in the outer spiral who have signed on, plus about a dozen mid-spiral systems who are explicitly or implicitly sympathetic. Obviously, that’s not a huge percentage of the galaxy as a whole, but we don’t want the movement to spread.”
    
    She paused, hating what she was about to say. “So, the Federal military commanders would like me to ask you to pre-authorize a declaration of war, in case currently ongoing diplomatic efforts are unsuccessful.”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084268680931713125 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084268680931713125><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Mar-23 07:16 PM">19:16</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Murmurs in the room. To her concern, Val noted several prominent senators actually nodding, like they considered her request reasonable. “Just to reiterate,” she added. “This wouldn’t be an actual, real declaration of war, but it would authorize the military to prepare for one, and would set certain parameters to trigger a declaration in the event of a diplomatic failure or stalemate. I’ve sent the requested details to you... now.” Her time was almost up, having spent most of it summarizing the current state of the outer spiral crisis. Val didn’t try to press on to any other remaining points; she just quietly said “Thank you,” and returned to her seat.
    
    Someone immediately called a break to discuss her proposed draft. Val was quickly inundated with questions, suggestions, pushes, trades, and generally the machinations of politics. She might not be an actual senator, but with her new position as the head Senate liaison for the Federal military, she might as well be in all but the ability to vote.
    
    She still didn’t know who had put her in for such a rapid promotion, nor why the brass had approved it. There were absolutely gears turning she couldn’t see; someone behind the scenes was probably manipulating her for their own benefit. Maybe Val was being set up to take a fall later if things went south with the outer spiral. She didn’t know, and at the moment didn’t really have the capacity to care. She was too busy with work to properly address her grief, but too numb with grief to properly sort out her work.
    
    Things would settle down in the next few days or weeks, she promised herself. She could take some time to reflect on Ifan’s... his... death. She just had to push through a few more days. That was all.

    Euvi hummed happily to herself as she left the supermarket and walked down the street towards the subway station. She let herself be absorbed by the tide of people - humans and aliens and species she didn’t know the names of - flooding in both directions. Several streets over, cars sped past, but this particular street was only for pedestrians.
    
    She glanced up at the sky like she usually did on the way home, noting a line of dark storm clouds encroaching on the sunset. Rain tonight; beautiful! Then it was a quick duck down into the warmer lights of the subway, where she leaned against a support pillar and waited for the train. Tonight’s mood seemed to be one of quiet reflection, Euvi noted, as her thoughts returned to the past.
    
    After leaving Sibdael with the hunters, Euvi had requested to be dropped off at a Federation outpost to do things the “proper” way. They had agreed and she had gone through the standard uplift program that taught her basic things like how galactic credits and translators worked, the rights granted to all sentient beings, and essentially how to function in the massive interconnected society that spanned the galaxy. After that, they had gotten her a few interviews and eventually a job and apartment on a planet in the Ojibisu system. Apparently it was an important coreworld, but that didn’t really matter to Euvi.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084268857172181063 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084268857172181063><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="11-Mar-23 07:17 PM">19:17</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>What mattered to her was her new life. She spent most days traveling to various industrial and commercial sites around the capital city, getting to meet and talk with all sorts of interesting people, before then installing, uninstalling, or repairing various electrical and mechanical systems sold by EloTek, whose local subsidiary she apparently worked for. The actual physical work reminded her a lot of her time in Amira Station, which lent a comforting sense of familiarity to her days. But being able to talk to so many different customers with so many different experiences and ways of being was <em>fascinating</em> to her. Honestly, Euvi was having a great time.
    
    At least, until things slowed down at the end of each day when the productive energy wore off and she became much more reserved. Quietly buying food or other necessities at the supermarket on the way back to the train station. Not speaking to anyone in the crowd, no matter how interesting they seemed. And riding back home with what felt like a muffled blanket over her mind.
    
    Euvi took the elevator up to her tiny apartment - not much bigger than her living compartment on the station, its main difference was that it had a large window to make it look much more open. Stepped in, unloaded the bag into the fridge and cabinets. Closed her eyes for a moment, luxuriating in the relative silence after a long, loud day.
    
    She made dinner because she could. The supermarket also had premade meals of roughly the same price as the ingredients, but Euvi had never been able to prepare her own food before, so she stubbornly stuck to it for nothing but her own enjoyment. She was slowly improving, and it was fun to have another hobby to occupy her nights. Today, she was tired (like most days), so she didn’t try anything too fancy. Just some rice, some meat, some vegetables, and a few spices. Add some heat from the little induction cooktop that actually fit in her kitchen, and that was enough.

Early on, she had actually gone out in the rain just to experience it, but nowadays it was frequent enough that she didn’t feel the need to go out every storm. Instead, she simply watched and listened, pretending the raindrops had feelings and destinations and were personally satisfied when they had found the right inch of concrete or grass to splatter upon.
    
    Later in the shower - with her eyes closed and pretending she was outside in the rain - Euvi started to wonder if this was it. That wasn’t a new question, but it was one that had been occurring to her more and more frequently as weeks passed in stability. Her life here, in the mythical Outside, wasn’t <em>that</em> different from her life in Amira Station. She spent the days working and the nights resting so she could do it again the next day. Physical rest by sleeping or mental rest by hobbies mattered little; it all stood in service of the next day’s labor.
    
    She continued to ponder this as she dried off and put on her pajamas. Was there anything more to her life? Could there be? Did she <em>want</em> there to be?
    
    Eventually, lying in bed and listening to the rain, Euvi decided that there was, there could, and she did. Just...
    
    An exhale of tired contentment.
    
    Maybe not quite yet.

    Hey, thanks for playing! To continue on the “how many protagonists died” metrics that seem to take the first paragraph of these conclusions: by my estimation, four out of the eleven named characters I had notes on managed to get killed over the course of the story. Plus, you know, the vast majority of the population of the Sibdael system. But on the plus side, that’s seven named “main” characters who lived! Also “the captain,” whose name remains a mystery. Maybe we’ll find out later.
    
    Anyway, <em>Amira Station</em> is obviously the direct sequel to <em>Eir Terminus</em>, following it by about a year. It wasn’t originally intended to be, but you know how these things are where they sort of end up directing themselves. I liked it anyway. It was nice to see Ellie, Mel, Honar, and Dr Zaes again, as well as get some really critical information regarding lacre, the hearts, and this new stuff ‘ichor.’ I wonder if we’ve seen or heard of that before...?
    
    So, what’s next?
    Well, as promised in the last conclusion, I’ll keep going as long as I’m having fun and there are still people following along. Both these conditions are currently check and check, so onwards we go. I’m guessing there will be about three possible prompts for the next set, but maybe only two if I end up getting rid of the one I’m the most iffy about. Or four if I come up with another out of nowhere! We’ll see - they’ll be up in probably less than a week, basically whenever I feel like it. I’m being a bit more loose on the timing here since I’m continuously pretty strict on the “one update every other day” thing.
    
    And as per usual, I’ll be archiving the current <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#story_updates</span> channel and creating a new one for the next story in a few days-ish. The next set of starting prompts will be up, as stated, basically whenever I feel like it, but probably less than a week.
    
    As always, thanks for your continued support and engagement, and I hope you stick around for the next one!
