                    Hello again; time for more writing! There are three prompts on the docket this time, so vote the one you want to see written out... or vote for two if you just don&#39;t like one of them. Or vote for three if you&#39;re an agent of chaos! I can&#39;t stop you! As usual, the prompts not chosen may come back later, be rewritten, or never be seen again. I&#39;m also trying something different this time: usually, I put my thoughts about each prompt in <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#story_discussion</span>, but I figured if I want you to read them, why not just put them in here right below the prompts themselves? So, I did that:

                    <em>Action, Comedy?</em>
                    <em>High fantasy OR Present day</em>
                    You’ve always had big plans. <em>Real</em> big ones. Now that you’ve got some superpowers, some minions, and a handy guidebook on how to be the best evil overlord you can be, it’s time to get going! Build a lair, defeat some heroes, and take over the world! ... Wait, why is the last step in this book “be defeated by the forces of justice?” Well, maybe you can work around that one.

                    <em>Blah&#39;s notes:</em> When I think of <em>Evil and You</em>, my man Skeletor comes to mind. Perhaps Bowser? Dr Doof? Evil, yes, but in a more lighthearted way. Sure, the evil overlord will steal the weekly mcguffin or kidnap the princess or plan to conquer the tri-state area, but then they&#39;ll stop by for tea and go-karting the next weekend. The story will focus on the evil overlord and their relationship with their nemesis (or nemeses), along with an escalating series of wacky-but-definitely-evil plans. But of course, given who&#39;s writing this, it&#39;s entirely possibly the comedy will slip into tragedy at some point if the guide ever recommends it... And there&#39;s nothing scarier than a permanent goofball finally getting serious. But for the most part, expect cartoon-level villainy and hijinks. It&#39;ll be fun!

                    <em>Action / Relationships / Melancholy?</em>
                    <em>High fantasy</em>
                    You are the hero of legend. You hold brilliant power to repel evil; no creature of darkness can stand up to you. Wherever you go, even in this bleak, war-torn world, hope follows.
                    But... you can’t be everywhere. You can’t travel instantly, and you still must rest and sleep like any other person. You can’t hold back the overwhelming numbers of the horde on your own, and the enemy continues to encroach wherever you aren’t. It seems, this time, a hero might not be enough to save the world. Unless you and those directing the efforts to fight back can find a way.

                    <em>Blah&#39;s notes:</em> The concept for <em>Limit of a Legend</em> came to be when I was thinking about stories where the main character is too powerful to be defeated. The obvious counters to such a character are to threaten those they care about who don&#39;t have such power, or challenge them in such a way that raw force cannot resolve the problem. So, in this story, the hero is basically invincible. Sure, they still have to sleep and <em>could</em> theoretically be killed, but assuming no catastrophic whoopsies, they aren&#39;t going to die. But they can&#39;t defend an entire kingdom on their own, no matter their powers. This story will focus on that dilemma, along with the hero&#39;s relationships with the royal family who they serve. Plus, there are wizards and golems in this one! It&#39;ll be fun!

Whether you prefer to call them superheroes, mutants, wizards, magical girls; it doesn’t matter - they exist and they’re here to protect everyone from evil spirits with the powers of righteousness and justice. It’s been almost a decade since the first dark spirits appeared and only a little less time since the first heroes appeared to fight them. The status quo has mostly been established; for the average person, not a lot has changed aside from an uptick in supernatural encounters on the daily commute.
                    But when you’re chosen to rise up as one of these defenders, you quickly realize things are a little more complicated than the general public knows. What do these “angels” and “demons” <em>really</em> want? Where do they come from? Why do they clash in such a roundabout way, using humans as their champions?
                    Perhaps most immediately pressing, though, is how you’re going to balance your regular life with your new demands as a hero. <em>That</em> one, you’ll have to sort out right quick.

                    <em>Blah&#39;s notes:</em> <em>Reflective Silver Love and Justice!</em> is the fourth iteration of a superhero / secret identity story that I&#39;ve wanted to write for ages, but never got a concept together that I was happy with until now. It will follow an ensemble cast of rookie heroes and villains, each granted their powers by a spirit of either dark or light, as they clash and... make friends? Wait, you can&#39;t do that; you&#39;re supposed to be enemies! Dear, oh dear, what will the powers that be think of that? The bulk of the story will be developing their powers and relationships, trying to figure out what these celestial interlopers <em>actually</em> want (are they <em>really</em> angels and demons...?), and potentially even challenging the status quo and much more powerful supers. Plus, it&#39;s got transformation scenes! It&#39;ll be fun!

                    Alright, time to prepare for some <em>Reflective Silver Love and Justice!</em> Let’s start by figuring out a few things about the setting.

                    Due to the large number of characters and perspective switches, the story will use third person limited.

                    How much is understood about how superpowers work?

                    <em>June 10th, 2028</em>
                    For Brianna Whitman, it all started on a particular Saturday in June when an angel appeared in her room.

                    “Hello again,” he said in a calm, authoritative voice much louder and deeper than-

                    “AAa-!” The angel was cut off by a scream that was itself cut off as Bria whirled around and saw who had just interrupted the silence of her formerly-quiet room. “Don’t <em>do</em> that!” she hissed, getting up to close the door.

                    “Brianna? Everything okay up there?” came a voice from downstairs.

                    “Y-yeah, mom. Just tripped and almost fell over.”

                    “Okay; be careful.”

                    She gestured at the door, lowering her voice again. “Please just knock next time?”

                    The angel hovered in place, tilting his head in seeming confusion. He resembled an animal, to an extent, though which one specifically Bria couldn’t say. Maybe a closer comparison was one of the cute collectible monsters in those video games that must have been designed by crossing an animal with a plush toy. In any case, it was the kind of body one would expect to have an adorable, high-pitched voice, but somehow the angel’s low tone sort of fit too.

                    Anyway, none of that really mattered; the only thing <em>truly</em> important about the angel’s appearance was the color scheme of his... fur(?): pale pastels bordering on white. That meant he was definitely an angel; demons always had darker colors bordering on black. Everyone knew that.

                    “My apologies. I will make you aware of my presence in a gentler way next time.”

                    Bria pushed her annoyance aside; it was very, <em>very</em> quickly replaced by excitement. “Thanks. B-but, you really came back? I thought for sure it was just a dream last time!”

                    The angel floated down lower, alighting on Bria’s desk and sauntering across her laptop’s keyboard. Not a single key so much as shifted; was he intangible or just really light? “It was not. Have you given any thought to my previous offer?”

                    This was it. He hadn’t been joking, or a dream. Calm down, Bria. “I have. A... a lot.”
                    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1317894089957703760 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1317894089957703760><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, December 15, 2024 11:40 AM">11:40 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Good. It is a serious decision. So, have you arrived at an answer, prospective hero? Will you join forces with the angel Zeal and defend the world from the forces of darkness?”

                    Zeal; that was his name. She had almost forgotten in all the- “Yes!” Bria gasped. “I’ll do it!”

                    “You will rise as a hero of light and dedicate yourself to the protection of those who cannot protect themselves?”

                    “Yes!”

                    Zeal smiled, or at least that’s how Bria chose to interpret his expression. “Then place your hand down, right here, and let the contract be forged.”

                    A sudden jolt of nervousness joined the excitement as Bria put her hand on the desk as instructed. No one really talked about this part of the process. But she couldn’t interrupt the moment now; not when she was really about to become a hero!

                    “You may experience some brief discomfort as your body is reformatted,” Zeal explained quickly as he pressed his hands (paws?) onto hers. “Any such sensations are temporary and should not cause concern.”

                    “S-sorry, what did you - ‘reformatted?’”

                    Zeal said something in reply, but Bria was too distracted by the sight of her arm dissolving to pay attention. A wave of sparkly light quickly spread from the point of contact up her hand, then arm, then shoulder, then a horrible static-y, buzzy sensation as her vision and other senses dissolved too. Nothing but points of light. A starfield inside her head.

                    Then it was over. Her body snapped back to full opacity, exactly the same as it was before. She stumbled back and half-fell to sit down on her bed, holding her head and blinking the stars out of her eyes.

                    “Yes, reformatted,” Zeal repeated, sitting down on her laptop - though again causing no effect on the computer. “Your physical body has been converted into a lattice of solid magic. The process brings an array of benefits, including increased resilience, heightened strength and agility, and of course, the ability to make use of the heroic abilities you will develop.”
                    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1317894157628346398 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1317894157628346398><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, December 15, 2024 11:40 AM">11:40 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She stared at her palms, slowly lowering them. “L-lattice...? Of... magic?”

                    “Worry not; your new body will function identically or better than the original in nearly every way. Now, are you ready to design your battle form?”

                    “Ah! Yes!” Bria quickly pushed aside the worries that she had maybe just been technically killed, letting her excitement return. Of course, she’d given this a lot of thought over the past week as well. Even though she had initially assumed his first visit had been a dream, there had always been that chance...

                    “First, your transformation item. This is typically a small accessory or article of clothing that you must touch in order to transform. You will keep this on your person at all times, as without it, you will be vulnerable. And, though I can recreate your transformer with time should you lose it, you should still take care to keep it safe.”

                    Bria knew all this, of course. Not the specific details, but every kid dreamed of becoming a hero; of receiving this very visit that she was now undergoing. Like most dreamers, she had believed it would never be her. As the years passed and she grew older, that hope diminished further. By her high school graduation, exactly one week ago as of today, she had decided it wouldn’t happen. Most people were normal, after all, and angels tended to select their heroes before her age.

                    And yet, here she was. “I know what I want it to be; should I just tell you, or...?”

                    “No. Envision it.” Zeal raised his paws (hands?) and formed a blob of glowing magic between them. “Direct your thoughts here. Shape the item.”

                    Without really knowing what exactly that meant, Bria just thought about it. Tried to keep the image in her head consistent, which thankfully wasn’t hard as it was a simple item. And, in only a few seconds, the blob collapsed down into a small metal hairclip - near identical to one in her bathroom right now, though heavier and... subtly magnetic when she picked it up?
                    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1317894222459699265 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1317894222459699265><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, December 15, 2024 11:41 AM">11:41 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Good,” Zeal said. “The item will attempt to stay with you unless purposefully removed, and if relatively nearby, you will have a vague sense of its location. Please wear it now.”

                    She clipped it into her hair. It felt right. And up next was the most exciting part...!

                    “Now, your battle form. It will reflect your innate affinities, the vision that lies within your heart, and your conscious interpretation of the concept. Envision it much as you just did your transformation item. Imagine the form as an overlay; let it lie atop your body. Then, when you are ready, touch the item with the intent to transform.”

                    “Okay...” Bria certainly had plenty of outfits to take inspiration from. Famous heroes wore equally famous costumes; some of them you could even get at box stores for cosplay purposes or Halloween. But the outfit tended to match the powers, and Bria didn’t know what abilities she would have yet. But since Zeal was having her do this first, there must be a reason...

                    She touched the hairclip and willed herself to transform. And, over just a few seconds as glimmering light streamed from the transformer to coat her body like a barrier, she did. Immediately, she ran for the mirror.

                    Pale white hair (did it get longer too?) and pale blue eyes: quite a change from her normal black and dark blue. The hairclip had morphed into a pair of spiky, crystalline ornaments, one above each ear. A thin silver choker accented her neck above a sleeveless silver dress that felt like soft, comfortable fabric, but looked and moved like segments of reflective metal or crystal. A pair of silver bracelets fit snugly to her wrists and a pair of silver sandals fit snugly to her feet to complete the outfit. Not complicated, really, but certainly flashy. And, she had to admit, beautiful. Especially the dress; how did it look like that while feeling like this?

                    “It’s... really good,” she breathed, turning and moving to get a better look. “But it’s not at all like I was picturing.”
                    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1317894281058324553 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1317894281058324553><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, December 15, 2024 11:41 AM">11:41 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Your heart must have had a different plan than your head,” Zeal declared. “But it should reflect ‘you’ regardless. Your battle form can change over time or with dramatic shifts in personality, but neither you nor I can directly modify its appearance. I am glad you find it pleasing already, as it is unlikely to change any time soon.”

                    She did a little spin, admiring the way the skirt sent chips of reflected light dancing across the ceiling. “I really like it.” If she had one complaint, it might be that it was maybe just a little revealing, especially if she had to do a bunch of jumping around in battle? But it wasn’t that bad really and Zeal said that neither of them could change it anyway and honestly there were a lot of heroes who had dresses or skirts as part of their outfits so it probably wouldn’t be a big deal. Plus, just being in the form imparted a sense of confidence; energy. She could get used to it. Looking like <em>this</em>, she could be a hero.

                    “Now, two last matters for the day. First, a warning. Your battle form includes a potent anti-recognition enchantment that prevents anyone from connecting it with your base form, no matter how obvious it might seem, unless they directly see you transforming. You are strongly advised to keep your true identity secret, so be careful when and where you transform.”

                    “Right.” That made sense; aside from her outfit and the hair color change, she still looked essentially the same. Keeping a secret identity - presumably to ensure she and her family wouldn’t be harassed for her actions as a hero - would be very difficult without magic like that. “And I can transform back by... doing the same thing in reverse?”

                    “Essentially, though you do not need to touch the transformation item to return. Simply envision the battle form’s overlay falling away from your base form, with the intent to change back. It should be simpler in this direction.”
                    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1317894290101506078 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1317894290101506078><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, December 15, 2024 11:41 AM">11:41 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>It was. With only a few seconds to focus, light flared across her body and Bria was back, along with her normal outfit. Suddenly, the warning about keeping a secret identity seemed somewhat more dire. The battle form really did change her mindset, at least a little.

                    “Good. The last matter is that of your name. All hero aliases are based on colors or terms strongly associated with a color, for ease of registration and branding. It is advised to pick a term that matches your battle form, if possible.”

                    Although the Bria in the mirror was just her regular self now, she could still clearly recall the shiny, reflective dress of her battle form. Really, only one word immediately came to mind. “Can I be ‘Silver’?”

                    “There are no conflicting registrations within the neighboring states. Congratulations, Silver, on your selection. I will return tomorrow morning to commence your training.” With that, he immediately leapt back into the air to hover, fading towards transparency.

                    <em>Scene 1</em>
                    “W-wait!”

                    Zeal paused in midair, returning to opacity. “Yes?”

                    “Er, what kind of training? Just so I can prepare a little?”

                    “Combat training, of course,” he responded like it should be obvious. “You are now responsible, in part, for the wellbeing of your community and there are many dark spirits to destroy. We will start developing your skills quickly.”

                    “Combat training,” Bria repeated. “Right.” In fairness, it <em>was</em> obvious; that’s what heroes <em>did</em>. But without the confidence of just a few minutes ago, the idea of actually trying to fight something seemed a lot more farfetched. That’s what the training would help with, she supposed. “Like, magic powers and stuff?”

                    “Later, yes. But initially, we will focus on <em>intent.</em> That and general defensive measures. Attacking will come afterwards, including physical and magical variations.”

                    “Intent... so, what I want to do?”

                    “It seems you are intending to start your training early. While your <em>zeal</em> is appreciated, it is not yet the time; I must finish your registration before anything further can be accomplished. Please, await my return in the morning.”

                    “Right. Okay, I’ll wait.”

                    “Then farewell for now.” Zeal faded into transparency and was gone.

                    It was late. She should get ready for bed and prepare to wake up early tomor - wait, did she forget to ask him <em>when</em> he would come back? What if she overslept, or woke up too early and had to sit around for ages waiting?

                    “...”

                    Who was she kidding? Bria knew perfectly well she wasn’t going to have much success in sleeping tonight either way.

                    ...
                    <em>June 11th, 2028</em>

                    “You’re up early today,” Bria’s dad commented as she hurried downstairs, already dressed and ready for the day well before noon. On a weekend during summer break, no less! “What’s the occasion?”

You’re up... late?” she countered, poking through the cabinets for some breakfast ingredients. If today’s agenda included combat training, she probably needed some food. “Shouldn’t you be at work by now?”

                    “Ouch; you want me out of here that badly?”

                    “No; I just thought you weren’t off today.” She looked back at him. “What’s the occasion?”

                    “Oh, nothing special. I’ve just got the evening shift today. Traded with a coworker who’s got a birthday party to attend this afternoon.”

                    “That’s nice of you.” Bria accidentally opened the fridge too fast, causing bottles in the door to rattle against each other. Funny; she had just done the same thing to the cabinet moments earlier. “Nothing special here either; I’m just gonna meet up with Yasmin. She likes to get up early.”

                    “Industrious,” her dad commented. “Well, have fun. Don’t play on the tracks in about four hours or I’ll have to scold you.”

                    “Got it; I’ll go be unsafe before then.” That was one of her dad’s standard semi-jokes. He worked as a conductor on the commuter rail, so if she got in trouble (or got hurt) obstructing his train it would certainly be very awkward for both of them. So far, she had kept a perfectly clean record; no rail-related crimes to report.

                    A few minutes passed as her dad perused the (digital) newspaper and Bria kept accidentally splashing milk around with her spoon. That got annoying very fast; it seemed like her hands were just moving with more force than she was used to. It took a lot of restraint to not smack herself in the mouth or clink loudly against the cereal bowl. <em>This has got to be a side effect of whatever happened to my body last night, right?</em> she wondered. <em>Maybe being “made of” magic makes me stronger even when I’m not in my battle form?</em> That sort of made sense, and there wasn’t really anything else she could attribute the change to. She’d ask Zeal whenever he showed up. After cleaning up all the spilled milk (and not crying about it).

                    “I thought I told you; first years have to stay in the dorms to get that scholarship. So, the dorms.”

                    “Well, yes, but when you factor in how much money you would save by living at home instead, it’s basically the same. And your college is just a train ride away!”

                    “It’s <em>two</em> train rides,” she corrected him; they had been over this before. “Or a train and a bus. Either way, it would take over an hour to get to campus compared to a minute. Plus, I kind of want to have... this sounds kind of lame, but a ‘real college experience,’ you know? It’s not that I hate you guys or want to get away or anything. Plus, like you said, I’ll only be a train ride away when I want to visit.”

                    “Two train rides,” he corrected her. “Or a train and a bus.”

                    “You’re a real funny guy, dad.”

                    Zeal showed up a little after breakfast, startling Bria again despite his promise by simply appearing in the middle of the hallway. He didn’t say anything this time, though, just waving in a floppy sort of way.

                    “What are you doing?” she hissed, looking back towards the kitchen and trying to block the view. “My dad will see you!”

                    “Have no fear; I cannot be seen or heard by ordinary individuals unless I will it. Are you prepared to begin your training?”

                    “He can still hear me if I talk to you, though! Can we go outside first?”

                    “So you are prepared. Excellent; let us depart.”

                    After navigating the kitchen again and saying goodbye to her parents (mom had come down not long ago), Bria left the house. Zeal seemed to have a destination in mind, so she followed him as he floated in front of her. Talking into thin air, or at least that’s how she would look to any passersby. Maybe if she put in some earbuds and pretended to be on the phone?

                    “Will this time work in the future or do you have other engagements?” he started by asking.

                    “-maybe. I do have a summer job, but it doesn’t usually start this early. How long will the training last?”

                    “As long as you have strength remaining,” he replied. “Or until you have other matters that require attention. It is paramount that you increase your power as quickly as feasible.”

                    “So I can help deal with the ‘dark spirits’ you mentioned yesterday?”

                    “Certainly. There is much to do. You will provide me with a list of available times.”

                    “Er, sure. My schedule is usually...”

                    After sorting that out, Bria’s summer was looking a lot busier. Zeal wasn’t messing around; he urged her to cram in extra training wherever it could fit, especially since she would be busier again in the fall. So much for relaxing, but it would be for a good cause.

                    “By the way, I was having some... um, trouble controlling my strength this morning. Would that whole ‘turning my body into magic’ thing happen to have anything to do with that?”

                    “Perhaps. Although all of your abilities are significantly heightened in your battle form, even your base form is somewhat improved in many areas. With some practice, you should be able to restrain your strength to an ordinary level again.”

                    “How much is ‘some?’ A few days or a few months or...?”

                    “Within the week, almost certainly.”

                    “Oh, good. I’ll just have to be careful for a bit...” Bria muttered almost to herself. Then, a questioning look around. They were walking (well, Zeal was flying) along the road right next to the train tracks. “Where are we going, by the way?” Surely not the station itself; it had only recently occurred to her how awkward it might be to have to interact with her dad as Silver. He wouldn’t be here for a while yet, but if they were staying around this area...

                    “Just over this way.”

In reality, they were still only a few blocks from downtown, but the illusion of isolation was convincing. And given that it was still fairly early in the day, there weren’t many people around. Bria carefully navigated past the few who were, eventually finding a little private clearing near one of the corners. Pretty good for a fifteen minute walk.

                    “Now,” said Zeal, once she had gotten settled. “Transform, and we will begin.”

                    “...” After glancing around one more time just to make sure there really wasn’t anyone watching, Bria touched the hairclip. A few seconds and one brief lightshow later, Silver stood in her place.

                    “Intent,” Zeal said, walking horizontally in midair in front of her, “is the desire you hold when performing an action. It is the effect you wish the action to create. When you attack, the intent is to harm. When you defend, the intent is to protect. When you simply step upon the ground, the intent is to walk.”

                    He paused. Silver didn’t say anything; this seemed obvious so far.

                    “Magic behaves in accordance with the user’s intent. It does not have a natural state; if you release a strand of ‘pure’ magic, it will have no effect. Your body-” Another pause. Dramatic. “-is made of magic. It acts <em>only</em> in accordance with your intent, unlike your prior, inferior body. If you hold unclear or weak intent when performing an action, the action is not performed.”

                    “...?”

                    “... What are you going to do?” she couldn’t help asking, but did as requested.

                    “Nothing. What do you think I would do?”

                    “I don’t know. Run off and hide so I’m just standing here talking to no one like an idiot?”

                    No response.

                    “Oh, come on. You didn’t <em>actually</em> do tha - oof!”

                    Silver stumbled backwards a step, rubbing her arm, and opened her eyes. “Did you just punch me?!”

                    “Yes. Now, I will do it again. Do not move, but defend yourself.”

                    “What does that even mea - oof?” A pause. “It... didn’t hurt that time? Or, not as much?”

                    Zeal floated back with an expression Silver could only describe as smug. “You held no intent to defend yourself the first time. The second time, you did. That was the only difference; I used the same force and you did not move in either case. Intent matters dramatically when it comes to your body’s natural responses, even if you consciously do nothing.”

                    “... So, if I think about defense, even if I don’t do anything, I’ll... automatically do something?”

                    “To an extent. Rather, all of the actions you <em>do</em> take gain efficiency. You may have unconsciously tensed or shifted your arm to deflect my blow in both cases, but only in the second case did those actions become more effective because of your intent. In heroes’ combat, intent is everything. Your attacks are only as effective as your intent to harm your opponent. Your defense is only as strong as your intent to protect yourself. The more you understand your opponent, the more you can shape your intent to better evade their defenses or better foil their attacks.”

                    “I’m... still not sure I quite get the difference between ‘intent’ and just... meaning to do something.”

But as you learn purely magical abilities, the power of intent will become quite clear. Strong adepts can even manipulate their unconscious intent to overcome limitations of their physical bodies. But for now, it is enough for you to simply be aware of the concept. Consider how it applies to the actions you perform.”

                    “... Okay.”

                    “Now,” Zeal said, clapping his hands (paws?) together. “We shall work on your defenses.”

                    “Why does that sound mildly ominous?”

                    Several orbs of pastel-colored light appeared around the angel’s head, slowly increasing their speed as they orbited. “Your first task is to grow accustomed to your battle form’s reflexes and agility. I believe a reasonable analogue for this exercise would be the game known as ‘dodgeball.’ Simply dodge the ‘balls’ as long as you can.”

                    More and more orbs bloomed into existence; Silver quickly lost track of how many were spinning. “Ah. That’s why.”

                    <em>Scene 3</em>
                    <em>June 17th, 2028</em>

                    It had been a tough week.

                    Bria had been training with Zeal every day for the past six of them and, while she had learned a lot, it seemed like she wasn’t making much progress. But beyond that, it had also been slow going trying to get used to her regular body’s new strength. The extra stamina was convenient, sure, but tasks requiring delicacy or precision (such as quite a lot of what she had to do at work) got complicated fast. At least she hadn’t actually broken anything yet; just gotten close.

                    Whatever. She was making progress on that; the training was the real problem. Zeal was really serious about it. Or sadistic. It could be hard to tell sometimes.

                    It turned out that, while Silver was certainly faster and more agile than Bria, it was still very difficult to dodge around dozens to hundreds of magical projectiles at once. None of the hits hurt <em>very</em> much, but “not very much” did start to add up after cumulative hours of it. And that was to say nothing about all of Zeal’s other “games,” like the one where he used beams or spikes instead of balls, or the one where she wasn’t allowed to see, or the one where she had to <em>block</em> instead of dodge, or-

                    Bria mumbled into her pillow before slowly starting to crawl out of bed. Although damage to Silver’s clothes didn’t carry over to Bria’s (Zeal said that was because most items she had on her before she transformed were “stored as magic” until she changed back), injuries to Silver herself unfortunately did. She (either her) healed a lot more quickly than before, and Silver was impressively durable even before that, but - again - cumulative hours of this took a toll. She had to be pretty careful in front of her parents to avoid any concerned questions.

                    “Intent,” she muttered while getting dressed. “Intent...”

That’s why she still felt kinda crap this morning; she had only had the night to recover from yesterday’s injuries instead of a full day. Maybe she should start asking for days off. But she still wasn’t moving fast enough even as-is!

                    “The effect I want to produce...”

                    Intent still didn’t make much sense to her. Well, “normal” intent was fine, but the difference between that and “magical” intent still wasn’t quite clear. She had experimented a few times even outside of training, transforming in her room and trying various actions without “intending” to actually do them, but that proved difficult to impossible. How could you throw a pillow in the air without meaning to do it? The opposite also seemed baffling - intending to do something without actually doing it also seemed a contradiction.

                    Zeal hadn’t been much help either; he was always more invested in getting her to dodge faster or block better or anticipate more correctly. He just kept saying “it will make more sense when you move to attacking.” Great, so why bring it up so early? Just so she could really think about it for a week? Probably.

                    Today, it seemed, would be that day. Yesterday, Zeal - well, to call him “satisfied” would be an overstatement - but he decided that they had been working on defense long enough and Silver was doing good enough to try something different. Tomorrow, he said, she would get to attack.

                    Which would be a lot more exciting if she weren’t still sore from all the failed dodges yesterday. But it was still pretty exciting.

A little reflective; refractive. Like glass. “Intent plays a much larger role in attacking than defending, as, in most cases, you must truly desire to harm or even kill your opponent for the attack to have a strong effect.”

                    Silver frowned a little. “I have to want to <em>kill</em> whoever I’m fighting? Isn’t that a little... much?”

                    “You will be fighting against dark spirits. Personifications of evil. Your enemies will not hold back, and you must not either.”

                    “...”

                    “Strike the target with intent,” Zeal instructed. “Desire its utter destruction.”

                    <em>I can do that,</em> Silver thought, trying to reassure herself. <em>It’s just a dummy, right? I can want to kill it. After all, it’s not even alive.</em>

                    He hadn’t said how specifically to strike the target, so Silver just stepped up and punched it with as much force as she could muster. It felt like whacking a bag of heavy gel; smooth and with a lot of give. The target wobbled, but nothing much happened beyond that. “How was that?”

                    “Again. Attack it several more times, until you are certain of its destruction.”

                    “... Okay.” She pulled back and hit it a few more times, getting a little more fired up. Maybe a side kick too, like she had seen in a video? Each attack sent the jelly-target wobbling about in a frankly quite humorous way, but none of them sent it flying or split it apart or otherwise seemed to produce any permanent effect.

                    Silver stopped again, breathing heavily with the exertion. “I... don’t think I can destroy it,” she admitted. “I mean, look at it. Nothing happened, even after all that?”

                    “Your intent is weak. What do you picture happening to the target after your strike?”

                    “It... kinda wobbles around?”

                    “So it is not destroyed, even in your mind’s eye?”

                    “... So, that’s the problem? Just that I can’t imagine myself destroying it?”

It is a matter of <em>intent.</em> You are not <em>intending</em> to destroy the target.” Zeal paused for a few moments, thinking. Silver wondered if he was frustrated. Good; she was too. “Perhaps... What is something you hate? A physical object or creature.”

                    “House centipedes,” Silver answered immediately. “Too many legs. Wait, you aren’t going to - eEK!”

                    As - in hindsight - probably should have been obvious, Zeal changed the abstract training dummy into a human-sized house centipede. It reared up on dozens of twitching legs, exaggerated mandibles clacking. “Now, destroy it,” he said calmly.

                    With another sweeping kick (she wasn’t about to <em>touch</em> that thing with her <em>hands</em>), Silver’s frantic attack landed right in the bug’s midsection. And, unlike any of her previous attempts, there was a weighty sense of power behind this one. No flashy lights or magical bursts; the centipede simply tore in half and scattered into fragments of pastel dust with the follow-through.

                    Silver stood there for a moment, eyes wide.

                    “Good,” Zeal said, still perfectly calm. “For that attack, you held an intent to kill.”

                    “Was that an intent to kill or just plain fear?!”

                    “You saw the result. Now, remember how the intent felt and do it again with the original target.” Zeal waved his paws (hands?) and recreated the first, more abstract training dummy in a matter of moments.

                    “...” Silver pulled back, still shaking just a little with the adrenaline from before, and...

                    “It was,” Zeal nodded. “But more practice on intent is needed, along with your technique. We shall continue along this track for the remainder of the morning. After that, perhaps you may find it enlightening to attempt a magical attack. At least, if your physical attacks have progressed sufficiently.”

                    Silver continued to struggle with intent for the next several hours. The desire to hurt or kill just didn’t come naturally to her... unless she was terrified of whatever target Zeal brewed up. Giant bugs and horrible monsters? Sure, she could kill those in the moment. But if given time to think about it, or with more abstract targets, she really struggled to gather enough intent. It just didn’t seem right. And of course, the one human-like target he tried, she could hardly bring herself to even punch it normally. The illusion was unsettlingly good.

                    But it wasn’t all bad news. Her technique improved quickly - almost naturally - though it wasn’t any ordinary fighting style. Her battle form just seemed to know how to move in effective (though flashy) ways for combat.

                    “It’s intent again, isn’t it?” Bria guessed as they were taking a break for lunch. She was sitting outside at one of the cafes near the station, facing away from the building to make it less obvious she was talking to thin air (aka Zeal, hovering over the table). “I have the intent to know how to fight, so my body... figures it out?”

                    Pleased at her deduction, he settled down on the napkins like a stack of carpets. “Essentially. You are beginning to grasp proper direction of your body through practice with your base form alongside battle training. Intent to harm is not the only useful kind - the intent to fight on its own can help a great deal with technique.”

And even if my technique is good, I won’t really do any damage unless I want to hurt my opponent?”

                    “This training works in less temporary ways.” He shuffled to the side as Bria needed to retrieve a napkin. “Your intent during training - with my assistance - acts as a spell that hones and adjusts your battle form. The purpose you hold will become the outcome, with some variation due to actual skill and the like.”

                    “...” She chewed thoughtfully. “So as long as I believe I will get better at fighting, I will get better, even if I’m not getting, like, formal training in martial arts or something.”

                    “Simplified, but yes.”

                    “Okay, I guess that almost makes sense. The power of self-confidence is a little more literal than usual.”

                    A pause as she continued to digest the words and toasted sandwich simultaneously. A horn and bells sounded from up the tracks, announcing the arrival of an incoming train. “Is there any limit to intent?” she wondered. “Like, if I truly believed I could defeat anything with a single punch, like that guy from that comic, could I do it? And... wouldn’t that make, er, crazy people the best heroes? Since they... <em>could</em> believe something like that?”

                    “Regardless of your intent, you will still be limited by the total amount of magic power stored within your body. All of your abilities make use of that magic in one way or another, so anything that cannot be accomplished with the totality of your body’s reserves will remain out of reach. There are of course ways to improve your magical capacity and thus the feats you can perform, including simple training.”

                    “I guess it’s good that someone who really honestly believes they could destroy the world... actually can’t.”

As you stated, ‘crazy people’ make interesting heroes. With incredibly strong intent, potentially divorced from ordinary unconscious baselines such as ‘acting as a normal physical body,’ such heroes can alter their own existence with startling fluidity. And unrelentingly strong intent can lead to problematic mutations of a hero’s body over time, potentially even including increases to capacity in order to fulfill the intent they believe so powerfully.

                    “But,” he continued, floating back into the air. “Often, individuals with such extreme intent are recruited by my brethren of darkness instead. Uncompromising vision and a desire to see it through tend to lead more towards villainy than heroism. The very strongest of these villains may become akin to... well, suffice to say, it is quite important that heroes like you destroy these burgeoning villains before they reach such a point.”

                    The crossing gate just across the street activated and approaching bells signalled that the train from before had completed its station stop. Bria watched it pass, accelerating towards the distant skyline of the city proper. “Your brethren of darkness... you mean demons?”

                    “That is the name they have been given in the current culture.”

                    “Do they have another name?”

                    “Calling them demons does the job. It is accurate enough.”

                    “... Okay; do you - or angels like you - do you know these demons, then?”

                    “Of course. They are who we fight, much as their dark heroes are those who <em>you</em> fight.”

                    “Right. I - I meant more like <em>personally</em>, I guess?”

                    “It would be unusual but not unheard of. Nemeses from former encounters, perhaps.”

She could have come right out and asked “Hey, where did angels and demons come from? (Was it the same place?)” but it was common knowledge that neither type of celestial was willing to talk about it, even to their heroes. It was widely believed that angels and demons were the same species - they looked very similar and had similar abilities, at least - but whether they actually came from “heaven” or “hell” was... an open question. Some religions believed so; others vehemently denied it.

                    Well, it wasn’t like she had any real chance of ending a decade of uncertainty with a few questions in a single afternoon. The curiosity lingered, but it was hardly her most pressing concern. That, most likely, was figuring out how to cast magic.

                    “And now,” Zeal stated once they were back from lunch and back in the park. “Magical attacks. We will begin with the simplest spells you can cast: unattuned attacks.”

                    He sketched the now-familiar jelly-like dummy in midair, preparing the target. “Unlike attuned magic, which is ‘flavored’ with your particular signature, unattuned attacks consist of nothing but raw magic infused with intent. No preparation or shaping is required, which makes them simple, cheap, and - above all - fast.”

                    Silver doubted they would be any of those things to start with, but hopefully she would eventually get there.

                    “You may find this process quite challenging to start with; many new heroes do, despite its simplicity. Perhaps because of it. In any case, an unattuned magical attack is very similar to a physical attack at its core: they both require directing a portion of your magical power towards the target. The difference is in the source and the flow.”

                    Silver almost interrupted to ask a question, but actually, she did know what was going on. Her physical attacks were magical because her body was magical. “Directing a portion of magical power” in that case was just a fancy way to say “throwing a punch” or the like.

                    “Instead of the source being the solidified magic that makes up your body, you will need to tap into the ether that binds it. You already do this when transforming, so it should not be a new sensation. And instead of the flow starting and ending with a physical motion, allow the magic to separate from you and impact the target. Otherwise, it’s the same.”

Right.” Totally the same. Definitely no gaping leaps of intuition there. But... although she was of course thinking this sarcastically, there was a hint of truth present. The core idea did sort of make sense. She just had to try to get a feel for the “source” and the “flow.” Whatever that meant. “I’m going to try transforming a few times to see if I can understand what you mean by the ether thing.”

                    “A reasonable idea. Focus your attention on the energy you provide to the transformer when initiating the process. That is the same ether used in magical attacks.”

                    “...” Silver changed back to Bria, then touched the hairclip again and really tried to pay attention to what, specifically, she was doing. It wasn’t just “touch this hairclip and think about transforming” - there was something else there. A hidden, almost unconscious action.

                    It took her a few transformations (actually nearly fifteen) before Silver started to feel confident in this “ether” thing. It was hard to describe. Maybe the best metaphor was the “overlay” one that Zeal had used to describe her battle form? There was her actual body - made of <em>solid</em> magic - and then there was the ether overlaid on top of it. Some other state; more fluid, more flexible. And containing much, much more energy. When she transformed, she was actually directing a portion of this ether into her transformer, which... did... well, something. It transformed her; she still didn’t really understand how it worked. But for now, even just this partial success was enough. Because, with that understanding of ether...

It was never going to be that easy. It took her nearly an hour to figure out a mostly-reliable technique just to grasp the ether outside the context of transforming, and another <em>two</em> trying to direct it properly. It felt like how she imagined learning to use a new limb would feel: just flexing muscles at random until she could work out which ones did what. Unintuitive, mentally demanding, and surprisingly exhausting.

                    Zeal tried to help throughout the whole ordeal, but it was clear he just naturally understood how to use it. His examples always came with a disclaimer that “this was how a previous hero did it” or “another hero understood it like this” or something. To the angel himself, it was like trying to teach her how to move her arm up and down. So simple as to be almost baffling.

                    Still, she wasn’t about to give up until she cast a spell or passed out trying. And so it was that, in the early hours of evening as the shadows grew long and the day’s heat began to subside, Silver actually did it.

                    To her surprise and enormous relief, something finally clicked and a burst of silvery light shot from her fingertips. Of course, she hadn’t actually been expecting to succeed, so it splashed against the ground instead of the target. A small spray of dirt erupted, leaving a mark in the grass.

                    “I did it!” was all she could think to say, immediately scrambling to her feet and taking aim at the dummy again. “Now, to prove it wasn’t just a fluke!”

                    Zeal hovered in silence for several moments.

                    Silver’s outstretched arm shook; she closed her eyes.

                    “It is impressive enough that you managed to-”

                    “HA!”

                    A second bolt of light flew at the target, this time impacting it squarely in the chest. The magic burst apart, leaving a fading residue behind, as the dummy wobbled back and forth. Nearly invisible remnant wisps streaked through the air, returning a portion of the expended power to Silver for reuse. Just as Zeal said would happen.

                    “Excellent work,” Zeal said frankly. “Many heroes do not get this far on their first day. With further training, we will work on reliability, speed, recovery, and refining the bolts into different forms. But for today, you should be satisfied with your progress.”

                    Silver straightened up again, unable to hold back a beaming smile. She had <em>cast a spell!</em> For real! She had just done that!

                    “I think I’m getting the hang of it now,” she said, aiming and - with a several-second pause - firing a third bolt at the target. This one was a little off-center, but it still hit. “How many of these do you think I can do in a row?”

                    “Given that you have been exerting yourself all day? I am somewhat surprised you are still standing.”

                    “One more, then.” Another pause; another bolt. This one missed entirely, breaking apart against Zeal’s safety net behind the dummy. Set up for exactly this scenario to make sure she didn’t accidentally hit a pedestrian through the trees or something. “Or two.”

                    “Silver, consider being satisfied with your progress and ending the day here.”

                    “I’ll stop once I hit it dead-on again, like the first time. C’mon...”

                    Another three bolts hit the dummy off-center, but with the fourth, Bria found herself unexpectedly returning to her base form in the middle of the attack. A wave of exhaustion hit her all at once and she fell to her knees, panting like she had just run a marathon.

                    “It seems you have depleted your available energy; you are too tired to maintain your battle form. It is recommended to rest.”

                    “G-got it,” she huffed. “Ow, ow; how am I sore in places that aren’t even in my body?”

                    “By the end of this week, I believe you may be ready for some field experience,” Zeal said, again perched on the napkins. They were at the same cafe as last Saturday, though this time Bria wasn’t exhausted from training in the morning. Instead, she had walked here from the library where she worked to spend the <em>afternoon</em> training instead. After lunch, at least.

                    “Already? Even though I still can’t get the right intent to attack properly?”

                    “I believe it will do you good to see the type of monsters you will fight. It may help clarify your intent.”

                    “That’s ominous,” she decided. The crossing gates activated just like last time, though this train was coming from the other direction. “What kind of monsters <em>will</em> I be fighting, by the way? I don’t think heroes generally fight demons directly...? Is it really all villains, like they show in the news?”

                    “It is not. Confrontations with heroes of darkness are somewhat uncommon, though they are the most spectacular battles you will face. That is likely why they are reported upon; day-to-day activities are less newsworthy.”

                    “Day-to-day activities like...?” She found that he often did this when she asked multiple things at once. A lot of their conversations involved Bria just restating the question a few times.

                    “Most dark spirits are less powerful than full demons, so they cannot empower heroes and cannot hide from us as effectively. They do still cause trouble, however, so those are the monsters you will typically hunt. Assuming all goes according to plan, you will see one in the field by the end of the week.”

                    “And you’re not going to tell me now, I assume?”

                    “All will be revealed in due time.”

Even when he did understand that she was asking a specific question, he would often withhold information “until the time is right,” even if knowing it ahead of time would help her prepare better. Such as, for example, what she might be fighting in the field.

                    It’s not like she was completely clueless. Other heroes did this too, but as she had mentioned, most of the hero reporting was on their clashes with villains (or “heroes of darkness,” as Zeal liked to call them). It wasn’t typically done to just follow a hero around on a normal day with a camera. Though, now that she thought about it, someone almost certainly had done that; it was too obvious an idea to have <em>never</em> been done. “A day in the life” content was popular, right? And what could be more popular than a day in a hero’s life? She’d have to do some looking later.

                    After another minute or so, Bria was about ready to leave and get started on the afternoon’s training. They would be continuing on attacks today, including shaping her unattuned magic for different effects. This didn’t involve intent to harm directly (“intent to shape,” more like), so she was pretty enthusiastic about it. But as she started gathering the wrappers to clear the table, Zeal suddenly looked up.

                    “Hm?” she noted. “Something wrong?”

                    “Not particularly. I merely noticed the presence of a hero of darkness nearby.”

                    Bria paused for a second. “W-what? Here?! How nearby; w-what do you mean that’s not something wrong?”

                    “Within a mile or so, likely. Detection is notoriously imprecise; I cannot pinpoint their location.”

                    She rapidly swept everything into a bag and hurried to throw it away. “Why is this not a problem?”

It is possible they are here because your transformations have been sensed in the past, but equally possible it is on unrelated business. There is no need to engage should you not desire it.”

                    “That’s - that’s good, but still, a villain in my town? Even if they’re not here for me, what <em>are</em> they gonna do?”

                    Zeal did a little flip in midair that Bria couldn’t interpret as relevant to the conversation. Maybe he just wanted to? “Who knows? Someone will likely stop them after a while.”

                    “That’s not good enough. What if someone gets hurt?”

                    “If you wish, you are able to engage the opponent yourself. You now have the core skills to perform in a battle, though they do need further refinement. And it seems from the aura that the hero of darkness is not particularly strong.”

                    “...” Bria hesitated, trying to balance her desire to be a hero and protect her town with her desire to not get hurt in a fight she probably wasn’t ready for. “I can at least try to find them and see what’s going on. But... you really don’t have any idea where they could be other than ‘nearby?’”

                    “Unfortunately not. If I could pinpoint an opponent’s location decisively, it would be trivial to detect their base form when they transformed back, no?”

                    “Right...” Bria wasn’t really listening after the first two words. She glanced up and down the street, seeing nothing amiss in either direction. But... “The train!” It was already gone, but it had <em>just</em> stopped at the station only a block away. Most heroes and villains couldn’t do anything silly like fly or teleport, and if Zeal was right that this one was relatively weak, it would make sense they would have gotten here on the train. Then... transformed at the station? Maybe? It was worth a shot.

What was she going to do if there really was a villain there? And, come to think of it, if she just ran in there as she was, wouldn’t that look a bit suspiciously heroic? She wasn’t sure exactly how far the anti-recognition spell on her battle form went and really didn’t want to ruin her secret identity this early. So maybe a bit of discretion was called for.

                    To that end, she slowed to a walk when approaching the building and pressed close to the side so she could peek onto the platform without being seen herself. Anyone who got off the last train would have been on the other side, of course, but she could see that platform from here and there were only a handful of very normal-looking people. She had to assume a villain would have a flashy costume and would certainly stand out.

                    And, as Bria peeked around the corner to look down the near platform, she was very much proven correct.

                    A girl about her age with long black twintails stood facing the wall, presumably... reading the train schedule? She wore a dress of deep, dark purple, decorated with belts, ribbons, lace, and other details in a frankly overwhelming assortment that just barely stopped shy of “no idea what I’m looking at.” A translucent black hooded cloak shifted gently in the low wind, somehow casting a dim shadow even on the already-shaded platform.

                    “Okay,” the girl said to the wall. Her voice was somewhat high and a little scratchy. “It’s at 1:35, I guess. If no one shows up by then.”

                    A pause, presumably as her invisible demon responded.

                    “Yeah, yeah. You’d better be right. I’m not gonna be happy if they just call the cops or something.”

                    Another pause.

                    “I guess that’s true.” The girl spun around and flopped dramatically onto a bench, sighing. “God, it’s so hoooooot. What kind of crazy person would be out training in heat like this?”

                    “Indeed,” he said at a normal volume. The privileges of being inaudible to anyone except Bria. “And her demon as well, though I cannot tell which one unless it reveals itself.”

                    “S-so, what do I do? It doesn’t <em>seem</em> like she’s doing anything, y’know, evil?” A pause. “And they’ve gotta be here because of me, right? She was talking about training!”

                    “Yes, it is likely your presence was sensed at some point. It seems plausible, given their current actions, that they intend to do something at 1:35. You may have until then to decide on a course of action.”

                    Bria checked her phone. 1:17. Just under 20 minutes. And, while she was there, she verified her suspicion on her transit app: the next inbound train was scheduled to arrive at 1:35. What were they intending to do with the train? Blow it up? S-surely nothing that extreme, but... surely nothing good! And why would she just be sitting around transformed until then?

                    ...

                    “You think I could make this cape do air conditioning?” Violet asked, flapping the aforementioned cape against the heat. “It’s made of darkness or something, so it should be cold. But-” She rubbed the wispy, lightweight fabric(?) between her fingers for demonstration. “-It isn’t. It’s just as hot as everything else.”

                    Vanity plopped down on Violet’s head to inspect the cloak. Despite her dark purple fur - matching Violet’s outfit - the demon never seemed to have any problems with the temperature. “Maybe! If you wish for it from the very bottom of your heart!”

                    “Gghhh,” she half-sighed. “I’ve been doing that for weeks now.”

                    “Hmm...” Vanity mused. “Maybe you’re just not sure what you actually want?”

                    “Yeah, nooooope. Get this summer outta here. I could use a good snowfall right about now.”

                    “You’re not usually this complain-y,” the demon pouted, tugging on Violet’s hair. “We’ve gone out in the heat before; what’s wrong today?”

                    “I’m not being complain-y,” she complained. “I’m just... annoyed that whoever that new hero is hasn’t shown up yet. Don’t they care about what I might get up to without anyone to stop me?”

                    “Maybe they’re out of town today?”

                    “That’d be real bad luck. You said you’ve sensed ‘em every day for a while now; why would they leave today?”

                    “Well, you aren’t very lucky, after all.”

                    “What? Why’s that?”

                    “Your cat is black; I heard that means bad luck whenever you see one, and you-”

                    “That’s just an old legend! If anything, <em>you’re</em> probably bringing more bad luck than he is.”

                    “Why’d you say that?”

                    Violet looked up, trying to spot Vani on top of her head. “If you haven’t noticed, your fur is black too.”

                    “But I’m not a cat!”

                    “I feel like a demon is probably worse.”

                    “Well - well, if we’re going by that definition, <em>your</em> fur is black too!”

                    “<em>My</em> fur? I don’t have any - wait, you mean my hair?”

                    The demon patted her head. “It’s basically the same thing.”

Pfft,” Violet laughed just a little. “Fine. We’re all unlucky.” Another sigh. “Maybe I should just get back on the next train if they don’t show up. At least then there’s AC.”

                    “You can’t give up that quickly! What if-”

                    “Er, ‘scuse me, miss. Are you a hero?”

                    Violet refocused. Duh; she was sitting at a train station just a few minutes before a train was scheduled to arrive at this very platform. Of <em>course</em> some actual passengers would show up. The passengers in question were an older couple cautiously approaching the shaded area as if Violet might bite.

                    “I sure am! Hero of light and justice Violet, at your service,” she sorta-lied. Obviously the “light and justice” part wasn’t true, but it was probably easier to do it this way than to have them run off. Wait, maybe that <em>would</em> be better? Would that get this new hero to pay attention and actually show up? “Er-” she began, considering revising that statement, but it was too late.

                    “Oh, good! See, Glenn, I told you it wasn’t anything to worry about.” Then, to Violet again, “My name’s Carrie, dear. Are you new around here? I don’t think we’ve seen a hero like you before.”

                    “Ah; er... y-yes, I am. I’m usually more towards the city, but today I just came out here for... a little visit?”

                    Vanity giggled from atop her head. “How deceitful! How delightfully evil!”

                    “Eh? What’s out here?” Glenn asked, sitting gratefully down on the bench Violet had just stood up to offer him. “Chasing evildoers to our town?”

                    “S-something like that.”

                    “Anything dangerous?” he followed up, helping Carrie sit down next to him. “We don’t get a lot of the supernatural nonsense in this neck of the woods.”

                    “Oh, no - I don’t think so. In fact, I haven’t sensed anything out of the ordinary at all today. I’m just waiting here for a while to try and lure anything out if it is here, but it’s probably all fine.” <em>God, what am I saying? Does that even make sense as an excuse?</em>

Glenn nodded in agreement. “We’d all be in a much worse place if it weren’t for you heroes.”

                    <em>This is gonna be sooooo awkward in a few minutes.</em> “N-no problem! Happy to help!”

                    In the end, Violet was powerless to break free of the conversation - by her own admission, she was “just waiting here for a while” and thus had nothing better to do. She had a pleasant chat with the old folks for nearly ten minutes while Vani laughed at her predicament and offered suggestions on what to say. And all the while, she stayed on edge, waiting for that hero that would <em>probably</em> not show up since they hadn’t already. But they could just be trying an ambush! And here she was, stuck in place by the chains of politeness. Still, even Vani didn’t suggest ditching them; she was probably just having too much fun watching to think of it.

                    In due time, the train arrived and the couple got on board, waving to Violet and explaining her presence to the conductor, who was rather nervous about a hero (or villain!) just hanging out by his train. Reassured by the old folks and Violet’s innocent smile, he nodded to her and closed the doors, preparing for departure.

                    “So, you gonna do it?” Vani reminded her.

                    “Oh, shoot; I almost forgot!” Violet broke into a run, heading for the front of the train. “Those old people were saboteurs, I swear!”

                    Vanity cackled again as the train’s brakes released and it started to inch forward. Still, Violet was faster; she arrived within view of the operator’s front windows before the train could get up to any real speed. “Sorry ‘bout this, but: shadow mist!”

                    A faint line of dim light - like an inverse laser beam - briefly connected her outstretched hand to the windows. Then, the entire front of the train was coated in a shroud of opaque darkness. A product of her magic.

You had better show up; I could be doing <em>anything</em> here. I could have just-”

                    “Stop right there, villain!”

                    Violet turned around to spot a girl about her age with white hair and a very fancy silver dress pointing at her from near the station building. “Oh, <em>finally!</em> You’re sooooooo late; did you get caught in traffic or something?” <em>Wow, that’s a cool outfit. How’d she get it shiny like that?</em>

                    “It doesn’t matter; I’m here now and I’m here to stop you! So... so stop whatever it is you’re doing to that train! Or I’ll make you!”

                    “Then make me!” Violet took a few steps forward, lowering her stance slightly to get ready to move quickly. Just in case. “Oh, but first, let me know your name? I gotta know who I’m about to beat.”

                    “What? No! I’m here to stop you, not talk to you!”

                    “Oh, come oooooon; are you really that boring? Look, I’ll even tell you mine: I’m Violet! Nice to meet you and all that. And you are...?”

                    “... I’m Silver,” she relented, only barely audible over the idling locomotive nearby. “N-now can we get on with it?”

                    “Silver, hm? That’s nice; it really suits your whole theme you’ve got there. And, hey, your hair matches your color too; is that part of the form or are you just using dye?”

                    “It doesn’t matter!” Silver shouted, then leveled her arm at Violet and released a bolt of simple light.

                    <em>Unattuned, hm?</em> Violet thought as she darted to the right to avoid it. <em>That doesn’t tell me anything. Let’s try and get you to use your signature magic. It feels like you’re probably all bright and sparkly ‘cause of your outfit, so maybe if I...</em>

                    “Shadow mist!” she called, pausing for a moment to generate a second bubble of darkness. She could only do two at a time, so any more than that would free the train anyway, but Silver didn’t need to know that. <em>C’mon, use your light powers to dispel it or something.</em>

                    But she didn’t. And unfortunately, Violet couldn’t see into the mist either; it was just as dark to her as anyone else. She was working on some sort of spell to fix that, but it was a lot harder than just making the mist. “Hey! You gonna do anything or just sit around in there? I thought you wanted to stop me, not take a nap!”

                    No response from the cloud.

                    “It’s not poisonous or anything; you just can’t see.” Another pause; something was wrong. “Seriously, what - agh!”

She hopped back up, wincing and pressing against her side; it hurt, but not <em>too</em> much. Silver, somehow, was on the other side of the station building and already aiming another bolt from the cover of the wall. “What?! How’d you get-” She stopped, ducking away from the next attack and reconsidering the mist’s placement. The cloud obscured part of the building’s corner from her original sightline. “You ran around the back? How lame can you get!”

                    “Better come get me, then!”

                    “Gghh-” Violet pressed herself against the opposite wall, now separated from Silver by the length of the station building, and focused on dispelling her second cloud. <em>And she still hasn’t used anything besides unattuned attacks! Is she purposefully trying to hide her signature magic?</em>

                    “Fine!” Violet pulled the energy of the second cloud back to her body, then quickly re-wove it into a different spell. This one was more complicated and dangerous, but at least she was immune to its effects thanks to her fancy cloak. “Choking mist,” she half-whispered, sending it to bloom around the corner where Silver was hiding. Then, Violet herself went around the back, guessing where her opponent would go once she discovered just how painful it was to stand in that new cloud.

                    “Gotcha,” she breathed. Just as predicted, here she was stumbling around the side of the building, coughing and lightly steaming from the cloud’s toxic effects. “I can do actual attacks too, you know.”

                    Silver saw her coming at the last moment, but wasn’t quite fast enough to dodge. She slammed into the wall from a sweeping side kick, still coughing and unable to back up - unless she wanted that cough to get a lot worse.

Feel like using any of your special magic yet, or is unattuned just your favorite?”

                    “... Why are you treating this like a game?!” Silver lunged forward, seemingly giving up on trying to shape a ranged attack from this distance. Probably a good idea. Violet blocked; countered, but she wasn’t a close combat specialist and couldn’t outmatch her opponent like this without the element of surprise. They both took a few hits in an inelegant display of mediocre melee skill.

                    “You aren’t taking it seriously either!” she yelled back. “You’re only using basic powers; why won’t you do anything special? Don’t you want to win?”

                    “...”

                    “!” Violet put it together. “You’re new! You don’t <em>have</em> any signature magic yet!”

                    “I’m working on it, okay?!”

                    “God, you must’ve only been at this like, a week or two. Did your angel really think it was a good idea to send you in - oof!”

                    “Take! This! Seriously!”

                    “Ow! G - ow; h - shadow mist!”

                    Violet retreated several paces into the dark cloud of semi-safety, stifling her breathing to be less audible. <em>Okay, she is very angry. Why is she so angry? Also-</em>

                    Train horn.

                    “Ah, hell,” she said aloud. “That was number three, wasn’t it.”

                    Silver shouted something as she went to attack where Violet had just spoken, but she had moved just after saying that. “Okay, fine; you want me to take this seriously? Choking mist.”

                    And then she leapt back to where she had just been, grabbing onto Silver and trying to hold her inside the cloud.

                    She fought back, of course, but between the darkness, the toxic cloud, and her previous injuries, Violet had the advantage this time. She just had to outlast her. Which probably wouldn’t be that hard, but it would be better not to underestimate her again. There might be one more trick up her sleeve.

                    <em>Scene 9</em>
                    The trick, as it turned out, was pretty simple. Whether intentionally or not (and Violet really hoped it wasn’t intentional since there should have been no way for her to know it was important), Silver managed to grab onto Violet’s cloak in their struggle and pulled the hood down. Which, of course, exposed her to the toxic effects of her own mist.

                    With an unexpected lungful of poison, Violet reflexively let go in order to pull her hood back up, and by the time she was done doing that, Silver was gone.

                    “Are you <em>kidding</em> me? Where’d you - agh!” She hurried out of the overlapping clouds, dismissing them both as she looked around. No heroes in sight. “She must’ve been pretty badly hurt,” Violet reasoned. “Maybe she ran away. Vani, you see anything?”

                    “She went around the corner!” the demon replied, fading into view on the station’s roof and pointing helpfully. “You really got her good!”

                    “Not good enough, I guess.” Violet hurried around the indicated corner, cautiously preparing to dodge another ambush, but no one was there. She looked around the empty platform a bit, but didn’t find anyone. “Can you still sense-”

                    “All gone!” Vanity interrupted, flopping back down onto Violet’s head. One of her favorite perches. At least she didn’t weigh anything most of the time. “You won!”

                    “... I guess?” Violet ducked into a little alcove beside a vending machine and swapped back to her base form, stretching as she walked back to a bench to sit down and recover. “She did free the train, though, so I guess she sorta won too. Or, well, that was sorta my fault, but - whatever.”

                    “I think you were super cool! But, was it fun?”

                    “Th - What, you mean fighting a hero for once instead of a training dummy or a random security guard?”

                    “Mm hm!”

                    “Well, yeah. I got lots of new ideas for what to work on next. I wonder if she’ll show up earlier if I come back...”

                    “Maybe if you’re dangerous enough!”

Instead, she trailed off into mutters. “But why was she so mad? I didn’t even do anything, really. So serious about it... is that what all heroes are like? And I really gotta know about that hair; keep an eye out for any girls with super white hair.”

                    Vanity tugged at the light blonde locks she was sitting on, giggling. “I bet she’s just like you!”

                    “Hmmm...” she mused. “Maybe...”

                    ...

                    Bria emerged from the station’s bathroom a few minutes later, passing some rich-looking blonde girl reading the schedule on her phone. “Aaaaand now the next train’s not for another 45 minutes,” the girl sighed to herself.

                    She sidled past, nodding in what she hoped was a commiserating sort of way. The frequency really wasn’t great outside of rush hours. Then it was off down the road to go home. She was still coughing a little, even as Bria, and felt very drained. Zeal hadn’t shown up again quite yet, but she had a feeling he might be a little disappointed in her performance. She didn’t really understand how she had gotten out of that second cloud; Violet had just... let go for some reason.

                    The angel popped up in the middle of the road a few blocks down. “I hope you have learned the importance of intent, now. You struck multiple blows, but none were sufficiently damaging to meaningfully progress the battle.”

                    “... I know. And her attacks really hurt because-”

                    “Incorrect. Your opponent’s intent was all wrong too.”

                    Bria slowed, glancing up at him. “Huh? Wasn’t she trying to kill me with that poison? And - and I still don’t really know what she did to the train, since it left before I got back, but... I figured it would have been the same poison?”

                    Zeal sighed. “The attack has a baseline level of lethality due to its innate properties, but the intent was <em>certainly</em> not lethal. You would not be so healthy had she displayed the proper resolution.”

                    “...? So, er, what <em>was</em> her intent, then?”

I am not a mind reader; I am merely looking at the results.”

                    “S-so the attack on the train, was that even poison at all?”

                    “I doubt it,” Zeal huffed, seemingly disappointed by that. “I observed no injuries to the passengers or crew. More weak intent. You will be able to easily defeat her with a simple increase of will.”

                    “...”

                    Zeal had her take the rest of the day off. And since both her parents were still at work, she had plenty of time to clean up and scrounge up some medicine to help with the cough. Just to stave off any questions, not because it was particularly bothering her.

                    After that, her dad got back first and she helped him clear out some boxes of junk from the garage. After that, her mom returned too and it was time for dinner and the like. No time to really reflect on what had happened until late into the evening. But evening did come. And <em>then</em> she had plenty of time to think.

                    The first question she tried to answer was that of Violet. What was her deal; what did she want to accomplish with all that? According to Zeal, she hadn’t had an intent to kill, and it was entirely possible she hadn’t hurt or even really endangered anyone besides Silver. Although her dad would be livid if she shared that line of thought with him; he could lecture for quite a while on how not to mess around near trains and blocking the engineer’s sight was certainly in the “messing around” category. In fact, he had already heard of the incident from the conductor on scene, so Bria hadn’t had to just imagine his reaction.

                    But really, in the grand scheme of things... not <em>very</em> evil, was it?

Why? Was she just curious about a new hero? Did she actually do <em>real</em> evil things somewhere else? Bria did some quick searching online, but there weren’t any mentions of a villain named Violet in the area, let alone one who was an actual menace.

                    “...”

                    Well, she didn’t know. But something told her that today wouldn’t be the last time she’d see Violet, so maybe she could just ask her later. After all, it didn’t seem like she had been in much of a hurry to fight today; Silver had attacked first.

                    Bria shook those thoughts out of her head. Most villains weren’t like that, right? That’s why Zeal kept trying to get her to want to hurt people. Monsters; truly evil villains. Not... someone like her.

                    Still, it didn’t quite feel right. If her intent shaped her magic, why did “kill” have to be the only option? Couldn’t she have the intent “to stop” or “to restrain” or something like that? Maybe unattuned magic wasn’t that flexible; maybe that’s what the “signature magic” Violet had mentioned was about. She still just didn’t <em>know</em> anything!

                    A breath. <em>Patience, Bria. It’s only been a week and a half. Don’t get ahead of yourself; you’ll get there.</em>

                    “Your intent has not improved,” Zeal continued as they watched the train slow to a stop in front of them. Bria headed for an open door to board.

                    “I told you,” she said quietly, trying not to look insane as she climbed to the second level. “I’m trying less lethal but still effective intents. I think I can stop someone without having to kill them, and the dummy agrees.”

                    “The dummy lives up to its namesake,” he countered. “The only way to survive against your foes is with the desire to end them.”

                    “Violet wasn’t like that.”

                    Zeal sighed. “That girl was hardly a proper representative of the forces of darkness. You will learn that today.”

                    “And that’s why we’re heading into the city,” she concluded, poking through the app to activate her ticket. “I’m kind of excited; I get to check out my campus again <em>and</em> do some hero stuff.”

                    Zeal didn’t respond, but she felt like he was annoyed. Well, the feeling was mutual. He didn’t approve of her less-lethal plan, even though her attacks were having more effect on the dummy now than when she had been trying to “kill” it. He kept saying stuff like he just had - that true evil wouldn’t show her any mercy and she had to be willing to kill in order to defeat it. The lack of willingness to even consider her viewpoint had gotten a little grating over time.

                    So, today he was making good on his suggestion from earlier that she would be ready for field work by the weekend. It had been two weeks since she had become a hero, and now they were heading into the big city to find one of the truly evil monsters he had been talking about. Bria felt like she should be more worried about that than she was, but for some reason she actually felt more nervous about getting lost when they got to campus. Of course, that was assuming they actually got there at all; Zeal might notice something beforehand and pull her off track.
                    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1325226527499223141 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1325226527499223141><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, January 4, 2025 5:17 PM">5:17 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Apparently most of these evil spirits fed on humans in one way or another. The ones that did so literally (the particularly animalistic, dangerous spirits) were typically found in less populated areas, like actual wild animals. She knew that; everyone did. But trying to get out to some woods would be a real pain since she would have a hard time convincing her mom to let her borrow the car without a good reason, and honestly that sounded more than a little too risky anyway. It would be like trying to fight a bear, except it wouldn’t be scared of her.

                    So instead, he was taking her into the city to look for the spirits that fed in other ways. The kind that ate emotions or thoughts (or even more abstract quantities that Zeal refused to describe until she was more advanced) proliferated in dense, urban areas. Therefore, heroes came to cities to hunt them and protect those who lived there. Heroes like the popular, powerful, and very well-known Aquamarine - he was on the news just this morning for defusing an explosives threat at the docks. Or, now, heroes like Silver. Not popular, powerful, or well-known, but you had to start somewhere.

                    These spirits could also be commanded by true demons - dark spirits capable of empowering humans to become villains - or villains themselves. That was another important reason to hunt them down, so they couldn’t become pawns in larger, more dangerous schemes than just their own appetites. Whatever it was they actually ate.

                    Zeal vanished at some point during the ride without saying anything, so Bria just watched trees, roads, and increasingly tall buildings pass by the windows until arriving at one of the city’s three massive stations. Then, since her angel still hadn’t reappeared, she just started walking to the transfer point to head to her college campus, as she had planned. If he wasn’t going to show up, then she’d just go do her own thing.

Just on the steps leading up to the elevated subway station, in fact, causing Bria to nearly fall down them (thinking she was about to step on a cat or particularly small dog).

                    “Please,” she gasped after managing to stay upright and embarrassingly hurrying away from anyone who just saw her trip on nothing. “Show up somewhere normal. Don’t just appear where I’m about to step!”

                    “There is no time; I required your attention immediately. Please follow me.”

                    Bria hesitated a moment, but did as requested, turning away from the station to hustle down the busy street. “What is it? Did you find a spirit?”

                    “Indeed, there is a dark spirit hiding nearby. I believe it will make an excellent introduction to the protections you offer those around you. Turn left at the corner, if you would.”

                    She dodged around a pair of strollers and continued on. “Is it going to be dangerous? Should I transf - er-” Bria looked around for a moment. “There’s nowhere to transform in the city!” she whispered. “There are people <em>everywhere!</em> How do other heroes do it?”

                    “There are always locations if you put your mind to it. Try the service road.”

                    “...” Bria ducked into the next alley and jogged a short distance before squeezing between a stack of pallets and a jutting-out mystery pipe. “I don’t see anyone... okay.”

                    Moments later, Silver emerged onto the street... and was immediately far more noteworthy than Bria had ever been. Phones emerged from pockets, pictures were snapped, and people generally took notice of her. It was like she was a minor celebrity, just from outfit alone - and what it represented.

                    <em>I’m so glad for the extra confidence I get while being Silver,</em> she thought, arriving at the lobby to a high rise apartment tower. <em>I’d be really embarrassed by all this attention normally.</em>

                    “It is downstairs,” Zeal informed her. “Likely near a mechanical room.”

                    <em>Scene 11</em>
                    “Official hero business, sir,” she told the doorman. “Could you tell me how to get to the mechanical room?”

                    On the face of it, her statement might seem ridiculous; she was a high school (college now?) student in a sparkly costume asking a fancy adult man to let her into the basement. She didn’t have any qualifications or even ID (even if her driver’s license would be useful, it had gone with her regular clothes and couldn’t be accessed until she transformed back). And indeed, she did still feel a twinge of awkwardness beneath the hero-ish exterior. But not enough to stop her.

                    And, whether it was her confident demeanor, the crowd outside, or perhaps that this particular doorman had been through something similar before, he didn’t need to see anything else. “Yes, though I will need to accompany you. May I have your name and the specifics of the issue you intend to resolve?”

                    “I’m Silver. And my angel says there’s a dark spirit in the basement somewhere near a mechanical room.” She looked up at Zeal, hovering serenely above her right shoulder. “Did you have any other details?”

                    “It is large and likely able to hide itself from ordinary senses. Though that ability should fade once you start attacking it.”

                    “It’s big and invisible,” she relayed. “Probably.”

                    He wrote a few notes, put up an “away from the desk” sign, and nodded. “Alright, follow me, please.”

                    Silver let him lead her into the elevator, after which he inserted a key and down they went. It was a brief descent, the doors opening to a short, much less polished concrete-floored corridor. Machinery hummed from behind several scraped-up metal doors.

                    “This is the mechanical room,” the doorman said, indicating one of the doors with a small window. “If you are to be fighting in there, I will stay in the hall for my safety. Please do not damage anything if you can avoid it.”

                    “Right. I’ll try.”

Peeked through the window to spot banks of electrical-looking panels, a few... pumps(?), a larger... thingy - she didn’t know what all this stuff was. But it was a fairly big room with a lot of machines inside. No monster visible yet, though Zeal had said it would probably be invisible. Cautiously, she crept inside.

                    “What should I be looking for?” Silver whispered, barely audible over the room’s baseline level of noise. “Or, not-looking. How am I supposed to find it?”

                    “Look for inconsistencies. Objects that seem out of place or otherwise incorrect. Alternatively, you could make yourself obvious and wait for it to attack you first.”

                    “I think I’ll try the first option,” Silver decided. “But it’s going to be hard to see what’s out of place when I don’t know what any of this stuff is supposed to look like. I’m not a mechanic, you know.”

                    “Perception is key. Observe.”

                    Ah, right. The old “just try harder.” Well, she could do that, she supposed.

                    Silver looked around the room, turning back towards the entrance every so often to make sure the doorman was still there and not looking too impatient or suspicious. Nothing seemed obviously out of place in the electrical work or most of the freestanding machines; there sure were cables and lights and loud noises that generally fit together. But, for some reason, she found herself drawn to the arrangement of piping near the far wall. Pumps (or some other unknown machine) thrummed, pushing water up the building. Or perhaps accepting water coming back down? Or both?

                    She stopped, considering the pipes. “Why do I feel like something’s off here?”

                    Zeal said nothing.

                    “Actually, why is the flow so loud? How tall is this building; how much water could the upper floors possibly need to be going so fast down here? This pipe is thicker than my arm!”

But by now, Silver had it figured out. “It’s here. Somewhere... right about...” A pause; a shuffle slightly closer and slightly to the side. Something felt warm nearby. “Here.”

                    She pulled back, focused her intent, and punched into the air with as much force as she could muster. Something warm and squishy deformed under her fist, rolling and rippling like a massive mound of jelly. Distorted waves flowed through the air, washing away a shroud of invisibility on a very large creature.

                    Its main body, in which Silver’s arm was now buried up to the elbow, was the shape of a gumdrop and the size of a car. It was dark, dull grey with stripes of lighter grey in a bee-like pattern. It had no legs - or they were invisible beneath its massive, flabby body - and its head was a tiny, neckless, eyeless blob of the same light grey shade. Only a pair of slitted nostrils and a comically small mouth added definition. And, last but certainly not least, it must have had a dozen or more arms. Thin, spindly, with knobbly lumps on the joints, the thing’s fingers were lodged in dozens of pipes around the room. Wiggling, writhing, doing who-knew-what to the water contained within.

                    The thing’s head rotated to peer sightlessly in her direction. Silver tugged her arm out of its body, watching its skin slop uncomfortably back into place with an audibly moist <em>plop</em> and a visible deformation left from her attack. She felt a tingle of base fear as the creature regarded her. “Zeal,” she whispered. “What on <em>Earth</em> is this thing?”

                    Fingers emerged from pipes, leaving strange silvery droplets behind. Arms curled in, aiming to encircle her. The mouth made a strange whistling noise. Silver had to fight.

                    <em>Scene 12</em>
                    She started by backing up, ducking beneath the two swiping arms in her path and getting out of the thing’s melee range. From that position of relative safety, she could focus on an opening barrage of ranged attacks - aiming primarily for the spirit’s limbs and secondarily for its massive, squishy body.

                    Accuracy continued to present a problem; the arms were too thin and nimble to hit with any regularity. Silver scored a few hits just due to how many projectiles she launched, but most broke apart on thick rolls of flab, dealing minimal damage. Those that <em>did</em> hit arms seemed to be more effective, but it was clear she wouldn’t be able to do much with this tactic.

                    The spirit could move. It waddled slowly along with little wriggling motions near the base of its body, advancing towards the room’s center and expanding the area its arms could reach. But just because she was out of its melee range didn’t mean it was out of attacks. Fingers dipped into pipes without seeming to break the material, emerging coated in droplets of sparkling liquid. Not water, certainly; a silvery hue was the first she saw, but every color of the rainbow made an appearance on its dozens upon dozens of fingers.

                    Silver hesitated, watching it warily and trying to determine how to respond. Run? Duck? Jump aside? Find some cover? There was a - !!

                    The creature flicked most of its arms towards her, creating a targeted rain of multicolored liquid. Silver chose to leap behind one of the larger, sturdier freestanding machines for cover, listening to droplets splatter against concrete and metal. Only a few splotches got onto her clothes or skin, though the ones that did burned painfully. Wisps of smoke curled into the air.

A drop of silver liquid clung to the skin there, just above her knee. She quickly rubbed it off with her dress, thinking it would be a bad idea to get whatever it was on her hands, and her leg began to return to normal. Still, a pale blotch remained like a burn or scar. Some sort of nerve agent? Did that even make sense in the context of her magic body?

                    A hand crawled around the side of the casing; Silver reflexively slammed it with her elbow. The creature whistled and withdrew the arm; Silver hurried to back up further, grateful she hadn’t missed and elbowed solid metal. “Zeal,” she huffed, finding different cover closer to the door as the creature pulled more liquid out of the pipes. “I’m not hurting this thing much.”

                    “Are you intending to?”

                    “Not this again!” Silver pressed further against the cool, humming metal to avoid splashes as more droplets flew through the air. “Obviously I want to get rid of it!”

                    “Hurt it. Kill it. Destroy the creature; <em>show no mercy.</em> You must not confuse moral treatment of a human with moral treatment of a natural force of evil. Even now, you refuse to so much as speak the word. <em>Kill</em>, Silver.”

                    “...” Was that really the problem? Could she still just not desire to kill this obvious monster? What was it even doing here; feeding? Did it really feel malice, or was it just trying to keep itself alive? Could she <em>hate</em> it for that? Enough to truly want it to die? It was kind of like a bug with all those arms, which she had been able to want to kill before, but always under quick, instinctual fear or stress. Here, it had already been long enough to outlast that immediate reaction.

                    “I’m just not aiming right,” she decided instead. Even if her intent was wrong, she probably couldn’t fix it in the next thirty seconds. “Its arms are too fast and its body is too squishy. I just gotta...”

Then, after dodging most of them by retreating behind the machine and trying her best to ignore the remaining burns, Silver ran closer this time while focusing another burst of unattuned magic. She kept a close eye on the multitude of nearby hands, but as she had expected, most of them were busy digging through pipes to retrieve more ammunition. None of them just tried to reach out and grab her.

                    She shot the thing in the head.

                    It was an off-center shot, but it still hit with enough force to send the little blob spinning impossibly around, its mouth and nostrils doing three full rotations before slowing to a stop. A smoking, glowing wound burned on the right side of its head; a splatter of grey goo decorated the far wall amidst the glowing residue of her magic. Arms and hands went limp, flopping to the floor with a drawn-out series of slaps.

                    A pause.

                    “Did I-”

                    The creature howled with an impossibly piercing shriek; Silver covered her ears but couldn’t block out the sound. Arms went berserk, flailing and slamming into walls, machines, and heroes seemingly at random. Silver tried to crawl back, out of its reach, but kept getting slapped further towards its body. The shriek reverberated in her skull, making it impossible to focus on any magic. Hands whirled everywhere, some still dripping with various fluids. Silvery liquid smeared down her right side, causing more tremors as she tried to clean it off, protect her ears, and get out of reach all at the same time.

                    “Kill it,” Zeal whispered, somehow perfectly audible over the cacophony. “Show. No. Mercy.”

                    <em>Scene 13</em>
                    She extended her left arm, trying to aim through all the mess. The unending scream rang in her ears. Arms and hands slammed down around and on top of her. The right side of her body refused to cooperate.

                    Somehow, even with all the distractions, Silver managed to fire another blast of magic at the creature. It impacted in the upper body, near the head but not quite hitting it. Minimal damage. Enough to get its attention, however. The thing quieted down somewhat, which was a blessing and Silver quickly tried to reorient herself. Unfortunately, it had only done that because it was busy gathering all its arms for a single decisive -

                    ...

                    “Downstairs, right?” Mahogany confirmed as he shouldered his way into the empty lobby. He could already hear something huge crashing around in the basement, but Justice always felt better to be involved.

                    “That’s right,” his angel agreed, zipping along beside him in his lightning bolt guise. For when he had to move fast. “Although I don’t see anyone here to provide the elevator key.”

                    “Who needs one?” Mahogany paused a moment to focus, causing plates of dusky grey wood to sprout and cover one leg. “This key works on everything.”

                    “Maybe-”

                    Crash. He kicked open the door to the stairs, severely bending the hinges and likely requiring the replacement of all three of them. Metal from the broken latch clattered down the steps. “Keep up! Gotta get there in time!”

                    “Oh dear.” Justice lingered on a few of the fragments as Mahogany leapt down each flight. “Unsalvageable. You simply must be more careful.”

                    “You were the one who said there’s a rescue to be made here! You want me to hurry or what?”

                    “Do hurry, if you please. I expect we will be in time, though only just.”

                    He barged through the basement door as well, rushing into a short hallway and startling some fancy guy who was apparently on his way back upstairs. “Comin’ through!” he yelled, sidestepping past. “Hero mission!”

Lots of noise. Oh yeah, this was the right place. Mahogany skidded to a stop just for a moment to get a feel for the situation. But <em>just</em> a moment, of course.

                    Giant blobby monster; lots of arms. Some cute girl passed out on the floor. Oop - fancy costume. That’d be the other hero; looked like he was just in time, as Justice had predicted. He didn’t bother taking in the droplets, pipes, injuries, or basically anything beyond the broad details - because he didn’t need to. There was a monster that needed killing; it was as simple as that.

                    “Over here, blobster!” he shouted, charging straight in. “Stop me if you can!”

                    It ignored him to start with, seemingly working on picking up the girl for presumably nefarious purposes. That didn’t last long, though, as Mahogany shifted both his arms into fierce, bony claws backed up by muscles the envy of any athlete or bodybuilder. The creature’s thin, knobbly arms were no match for his buff, sharp ones and he severed one at the second elbow with his first strike. And second. And-

                    “Ears!” Justice yelled. Mahogany started shifting immediately, and understood within moments as the creature screeched with unbearable intensity. But, thanks to his now-reinforced eardrums, all he could hear was a distant angry whistle. Like a teakettle from across the house.

                    “Good call,” he shouted silently, grinning as every arm in the room converged on him. But he wasn’t incapacitated by the screech as the creature had expected, and he met its massive attack with a duck, a slide, and a guillotine-like blade that replaced his left arm as he performed the dodge. Severed hands and fingers dotted the ground; the room shook with the monster’s howl.

                    “Let’s finish you off,” he said, again unable to hear himself. A dead sprint forward was followed by a heavy leap - exchanging his wood-coated leg for a light but springy pair to heighten his jump - and he found himself clinging to the creature’s corpulent body just below the head.

But not fast enough, whatever the case. Mahogany added more mass to his guillotine blade - siphoning it from his legs to fuel the process - and let gravity help him deliver the final blow. The creature’s head (oh, already shot once - good try, other hero) was flung clean off and landed with a wet, inaudible splotch somewhere down below.

                    Arms fell to the ground, dead. Mahogany let himself slide to the floor and shifted his body back to normal, shaking his head as his ears popped uncomfortably. “Geh. J, you good?”

                    “Perfectly fine,” Justice replied, popping out of the nearest wall in his normal, teddy bear-like form. “Excellent work as usual.”

                    “You’re just sayin’ that,” he deflected with the usual grin. “A+ heads up there, by the way. With the ears? Coulda got me good if you hadn’t noticed.”

                    “I believe you are just saying that,” Justice repeated, though with the same grin. They got each other. “Ah, would you mind checking on our rescue while I dispel this monstrosity?”

                    “You got it.”

                    He jogged closer to the entrance, spotting the fancy guy from earlier on the way. “Oh, hey. You work here?”

                    “Yes, sir.”

                    “Cool. Give us just a few minutes; I got it.” He thumbed over his shoulder. “As you can see. My partner’s gonna clean everything up for ya.”

                    “Very good, sir. May I have your name for the report?”

                    “Mahogany. And my little buddy’s Justice, if you need ‘im. Probably wait upstairs, ok? We’ll come get ya once we’re done.”

                    The fancy guy hesitated a moment, but gave in. “Of course. Please stop by the reception when you’re finished.”

                    Thumbs up. The fancy guy departed. What was he supposed to be - oh, right; her! Mahogany turned back to the unconscious girl, but she wasn’t unconscious anymore; she was already sitting up and holding the big ol bump on the noggin that the monster had given her.

                    “Yep! And just in time. I’m Mahogany, but my friends call me Hog. My little buddy over there’s Justice, but <em>his</em> friends call him J.”

                    She got the hint. “I’m... Silver. And - I don’t know where Zeal is. He should... be somewhere.”

                    Justice glanced over briefly with an odd expression. Mahogany didn’t even notice. Unusually, he was fully visible to Silver and gave her a brief wave before returning to his cleanup.

                    “Silver, huh? Nice to meetcha! And double nice that we happened to be patrollin’ in the right area to help out. How long you been hero-ing?”

                    “About... two weeks?” Silver rubbed her head again, starting to stand up.

                    Mahogany held out a hand to help her. “Wow! And you were taking on a big blobby guy like this? J, you think this guy was a ‘two weeks’ monster?”

                    “Oh, heavens, no. I would not have let you near a spirit with this level of power until at least two months in. I suppose your partner-” He addressed Silver directly. “-must have quite a high opinion of you.”

                    For some reason, she looked away at that. “Guess so...”

                    <em>Scene 14</em>
                    ...

                    A good while later, Silver sat on a bench in a nearby park, trying to figure out how to eat a hot dog without getting her hero outfit dirty.

                    After wrapping things up with the doorman from the building (both heroes had to sign some papers to affirm the damages caused were from a legitimate battle - for insurance purposes, apparently), Mahogany had decided he wanted lunch. And thus, since Silver had already agreed to talk with him afterwards, she accompanied him to the park and waited for a bit while he found a hot dog vendor. She wasn’t sure if he had transformed back to actually purchase them or if he somehow had some money in his battle form, but they were both still transformed now, thus drawing some minor attention from the occasional observant passersby.

                    Mahogany’s outfit was just as flashy as Silver’s, or potentially even more so. He seemed to be a year or two older than her, with short, spiky, kinda maroonish hair. Really muscular, like “professional athlete” level, and it definitely showed through the reddish, not quite skintight bodysuit sorta thing that formed the base of his hero costume. Plates of grey wood accented it at strategic points for protection, or maybe just decency. In any case, the sleeveless design and shorts made it so he was probably showing more skin than her overall. Which Silver <em>definitely</em> hadn’t noticed.

                    Anyway, Justice was also here, hovering gently overhead and snacking on a bag of chips Mahogany had bought. It was kind of weird to have an angel just hanging out so casually, let along <em>eating</em>. Did he need to do that or was it just for fun? Zeal never ate anything during their lunch breaks; was he running off to the supermarket when she wasn’t looking? Speaking of, where was he? Silver wasn’t sure to feel a little worried or a little annoyed, so settled on a bit of both.

                    “So,” she decided to begin. “What did you want to talk about?”

He scarfed it down to reply. “Wanted to ask if we could come with ya today on your monster hunts.”

                    “Sure, if you want.” A pause. “Do you think I can’t handle it on my own?”

                    “No; no! That’s not it! It’s just not every day you see a new hero out ‘n about. We might team up later, so why not make friends now?”

                    “I guess.” She didn’t quite believe the “no’s.”

                    “Sweet! Oh, let’s swap numbers too so we can meet up if anything happens.” Mahogany wiped his left hand on a napkin, then tapped it on a metal bracer on his other arm. A brief glow of transformation-esque light and he was holding a phone. “What’s yours? I’ll text you.”

                    “Hang on - two things! First, how did you do that? Second, wouldn’t our phone numbers give away our regular identities?”

                    “Oop - J, when’d you teach me this partial stuff?”

                    “Third week, along with your first signature magic.”

                    “Ah, and you said two, yeah? Dang.”

                    “Sorry, ‘partial stuff?’ Is it like a partial transformation? So, that’s your real phone?”

                    “Yeah! It’s like when you change back to your base form, right? But instead of doing it all the way, you just wanna cancel it on one bit of your stuff. That’s why it’s easier to do it when you tap your transformer, so you don’t whoopsie-undo your whole form all at once.”

                    “I... sort of get it, I think.” Silver considered reaching up to the crystal spikes in her hair, but... “I don’t think I’m going to try it right now, though. Since I might accidentally change back all the way right in front of you.”

                    “Yeah, makes sense. You could go hide over there for a bit, but it took a while to figure out for me. Might be here all day. Unless you’re really good at transforming?” he asked hopefully.

                    “I don’t think so? Just regular?”

                    “Dang.”

                    A pause. Was he like Zeal, where he’d forget the other thing if you asked him about two things at once?

It still uses your existing number and the like, but cannot be connected to your base form by anyone who has not witnessed your full transformation.”

                    “... How does that work? Surely I’d still have the number saved even when I transformed back, so couldn’t I just look it up?”

                    “The idea simply will not occur to you. Our anti-recognition magic is extremely powerful.” He crossed his arms with a little nod. “And well-adapted for the modern day.”

                    “Wait, so would it work if she just told me?” Mahogany asked. “With the recognition spell?”

                    Justice considered this for a moment. “I don’t see why it wouldn’t. There is nothing special about the device itself; the <em>information</em> is what is shared - and hidden - regardless.”

                    “So, how about it?”

                    “Er-” Silver wasn’t so sure about testing the limits of the anti-recognition enchantment like this with someone she barely knew. He <em>seemed</em> nice enough, but she had just met him like an hour ago. Also- “I... actually don’t know my phone number without looking at it.”

                    A pause. “Ha!” Mahogany laughed. “I don’t know mine either, now that I think about it! Here, I’ll look and just give it to you for later. You have like, a piece of paper or something?”

                    “Uh...”

                    They eventually figured something out, though it took an embarrassingly long time. When she transformed back to Bria later, she’d be able to text Mahogany. If she wanted. And later-er, whenever Zeal showed up again, she’d ask him to teach her how to do the partial transformation trick... or maybe she’d try that on her own first. It couldn’t be that hard if she could already do a full transformation, right?

                    “Well...”

                    They took the nearby train down to one of the stops close to Bria’s (future?) college, startling some other passengers and having several more pictures taken. Of course, that choice of location prompted Mahogany to ask if there was any particular meaning to it and Silver had to decide how much she wanted to share. But, given Justice’s reassurances that information shared as Silver couldn’t be traced back to Bria, she eventually admitted it.

                    Of course, the obvious follow-up question was - “So, what’s your major?” Mahogany asked.

                    Silver almost sighed, but she had expected it. “I don’t know yet. I’m just doing gen eds and some exploratory classes in my first semester and trying to figure it out.”

                    “Really? You can do that?”

                    This time she actually sighed; she didn’t like thinking too much about that topic. “Obviously. Otherwise I wouldn’t be doing it.”

                    “Seems kinda fun,” he commented, seemingly ignoring or not noticing her reluctance. “Gettin’ to figure out what you want to do. I just got a job out of high school; wasn’t too good at academics.” A pause. He glanced down one of the long open streets towards the water, but it couldn’t be seen from here. “I’d really like to make hero-ing my actual job. Like Aquamarine, you know? But it’s tougher than you’d think tryin’ to get paid without joining one of the big groups. And that’s not really my style either.”

                    “Really?” Silver was just glad for the change of topic. “Why not? It seems like you’ve been working together with me just fine today.” <em>Well, at least for the past few hours,</em> she added silently. And they hadn’t really <em>done</em> anything yet.

                    “Yeah. It’s just, a lotta heroes are real assholes. And in the big groups, you gotta deal with a whole lot of them. I’ve got a real limited tolerance for jerks, so it didn’t really work out.”

                    “You’ve tried before?”

I think the first group fell apart a few months after I left, but the second one’s still around. I think it’s called Beacon? Or was it an acronym for something like B.E.A.C.O.N.? Bacon?” He stopped mid-stride for a moment, then resumed. “Now I’m hungry again. Anyway, I figured going solo might work better, so I’ve been doing that for a while now. Has it been a year? Must be close if not. Work with some other heroes every now and then - like you today - but mostly it’s just me and J.”

                    “...” She didn’t really know what part of all that to comment on, but had to say something. “I’m sure you’ll find a good group eventually if you keep looking.”

                    “Pfft. Nah, I don’t need one anymore. I just gotta learn how to get paid for this stuff. It’s tough to get actual contracts unless you’re with a big group, but it can’t be impossible. Just gotta figure out the business stuff.”

                    “...” Silver <em>really</em> hadn’t thought about that part of being a hero. Could she make it her job? As a backup plan if college didn’t work out? Did she even want to? Would she be able to join a group? Was it worth it? Heroes like Aquamarine made it seem so easy, but... well, clearly <em>most</em> heroes didn’t make a living by being heroes. The numbers just didn’t add up; there were so many more who didn’t have much of a public presence than those who did.

                    Well, she had quite a while to figure it out. She was already taking a whole semester to decide what her major should be; she could take just as long to decide how central being a hero should be for her life.

                    Thankfully, Justice interrupted a few minutes later, having detected a smaller dark spirit more suitable for Silver’s current level of power. The three of them quickly hurried over to a nearby bakery, slipping around the side into a small service road to search for the mystery monster. It took a few minutes of poking through crevices and debris, but eventually-

                    Mahogany hurried over. “Isn’t it a little tall, too? Like, I could trip over that thing.”

                    “Yeah...”

                    A grin. “Blast it! I bet it’s a mimic!”

                    “A - you think that’s a monster?” She peered a little closer. “It looks so real!”

                    “Careful; don’t get too close,” he warned. “Those things bite.”

                    She hurriedly took a few steps back, then decided to test it. Focus. Intent. Could she really visualize killing a manhole cover? No? Well, that was fine; she didn’t need to. Just aim and...

                    The blast of magic burst apart on impact, leaving a glittery residue and releasing a splatter of scaly fragments. The manhole cover leapt out of the ground - revealing only normal road beneath it - and scurried around at a rapid pace. Mahogany grew a wooden plate over his fist and punched the ground in front of him, causing the bug-like creature to spin and skitter back towards Silver. “All yours!” he exclaimed.

                    Silver wasn’t entirely sure she wanted it to be all hers, actually, but focused energy to her feet regardless. It was moving too fast to hit with a ranged attack, but if she stomped down just at the right time...

                    Splat.

                    “Oof, that one must’ve been mostly full,” Mahogany commented, politely wincing at the mess of goop splattered up Silver’s legs to nearly the knees. “You really got it, though. And J can clean that up for ya.”

                    “... Thanks.”

Each time, they had only helped spot or corral the monsters, letting Silver handle actually dispatching them. She still suspected they had mostly been following her around to make sure she wouldn’t get hurt taking on another arms guy or the like, and Mahogany probably could have taken out all the little monsters way more easily than she did, but... she did feel maybe a little more confident having done it all (mostly) herself.

                    Speaking of doing things herself, actually, where the heck was Zeal? It was getting late and the angel still hadn’t returned. Was he mad at her? In trouble somewhere? She had no idea how to find him or even if he wanted to be found. Should she go look for him? Where?

                    Silver hesitated indecisively at the entrance to the city’s main station where she would catch the train back home. Surely he’d be fine and would just show up again at some point. He never seemed to understand (or care?) about his abrupt appearances and disappearances. Plus, it wasn’t like anyone could really hurt an angel. Right? She’d never heard of anything like that happening.

                    “...”

                    Yeah, it would be fine.

                    <em>Scene 16</em>
                    But...

                    Silver snuck into a secluded area mostly hidden by a row of decorative pillars and transformed back. Then, she-

                    “...”

                    Bria hesitated, sitting down on a nearby bench to collect herself. Silver’s confidence disappeared with the battle form, leaving behind the really quite terrifying memories of her encounter with the horrible multi-armed creature. Her body refusing to obey after being splashed with that silver liquid. The sudden spike of fear just as she realized she wouldn’t have time to avoid its dozen-armed blow. The more subtle worry of what it had even been doing in the pipes - Mahogany hadn’t seemed to care, and they never talked to the doorman about it either.

                    Why was she being so nonchalant about all this? She could have died if he hadn’t shown up, and that had been a total coincidence!

                    <em>Okay,</em> she thought, trying to slow her breathing. <em>Being Silver affects my mind a lot more than I thought.</em>

                    “...”

                    She definitely considered transforming back for a moment, just to get rid of the doubts and fears. In fact, she might very well have done so if a group of travelers hadn’t been talking uncomfortably close and she wasn’t sure if they could see or not. And, thankfully, by the time they sorted out their plans and left, the mental discomfort had lessened somewhat. She was okay; it’d go smoother next time. She’d get better after every try. And she’d never have to face a monster like that <em>as Bria.</em> Silver was much better equipped for that sort of thing, and she could be Silver at a moment’s notice. Did that even make sense? It didn’t have to.

                    <em>Okay,</em> she repeated. <em>Where the heck is Zeal?</em> Right, that was the problem at hand (and a good distraction from the lingering - stop it; be distracted).

Well, she could go look where she had last seen him, which was near that big apartment building previously housing the... the fancy doorman. Yeah, that’s who she was thinking of. Maybe she could find some clues there? It sort of made sense; she decided to get up and start walking in that direction while thinking of a better way than just wandering around the city.

                    Bria pulled out her phone to check the map, and in doing so remembered the little piece of paper with Mahogany’s number on it. Maybe she could ask him; he probably would know more about angels. <em>But where did the paper go?</em> she wondered. <em>I put it in the little hidden pocket on my hero dress, but where did it go when I changed back?</em>

                    It wasn’t in any of her regular pockets or tucked away somewhere unexpected (at least, not by checking for the sound of rustling paper), so she really started to think it had gone away with her battle form or something. But before trying to change back or just admitting she had lost it, Bria decided to look around where she had returned to her base form... and found a crumpled slip of paper lying on the floor.

                    <em>Must’ve fallen out when I changed back?</em> she assumed. <em>I’ll have to be careful of that later.</em>

                    A few taps saved the contact and she started typing “hi, this is Bria” before remembering that she wasn’t Bria to him actually and replacing her name with “Silver.” That would have been a dumb way to blow her identity, and one she would <em>absolutely</em> mess up at some point if she started texting with more heroes. Maybe she could separate him into a different category or something to remember?

                    “I still haven’t seen Zeal,” she typed, before redoing the next line several times as she couldn’t decide how to phrase it. Finally, she decided enough was enough and just sent “is there a good way to find him or will he just come back sometime?”
                    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1329616324032462970 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1329616324032462970><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, January 16, 2025 8:00 PM">8:00 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Nothing back yet, so she finished checking the map as originally intended and started walking. It would only take a few minutes, though she wasn’t sure what she was hoping to find there. He wouldn’t just be hanging out in the lobby, and Bria wouldn’t be allowed to check out the basement. Honestly, it would be kind of weird for her to enter the building at all without some kind of excuse.

                    Her phone vibrated. Bria quickly pulled it back out, eager for a useful response, but it was just “hey!!” At least he was still typing now. She’d be patient.

                    Nothing seemed particularly noteworthy around the apartment building once she arrived, except for the plumbing company’s truck parked just next door. Well, there had been maybe just a little bit of damage downstairs. But no angels or any traces of where Zeal might have gone. Mahogany texted her again.

                    “I asked justice and he says you shouldn’t worry about him, he’s probably sulking!”

                    “Really?” she replied. “Why would he be sulking?”

                    Another pause. “Cuz we’re a better team than him? Dunno, justices being kinda weird, I think he knows him”

                    “How? Are they friends?”

                    A surprisingly long pause. Bria crossed the street to have something to do besides just loiter around suspiciously.

                    “He’s not telling, sorry,” came the delayed response. “You know how angels are”

                    Well then. She knew how angels were.

                    Uneasy, but with no real leads to follow and some reassurances from Justice and Mahogany, Bria ended up just returning to the station and boarding a train to go home. And so, as the locomotive was navigating a set of switches before starting to get up to speed, she was surprised by a certain angel suddenly appearing above the seat right in front of her.

                    <em>Scene 17</em>
                    “Wh - yes? But no thanks to you; I was worried!” She glanced around to make sure there weren’t any people close enough to hear as long as she kept her voice down. Zeal didn’t respond in the meantime, so she just continued. “Why do you keep doing stuff like this - vanishing without saying anything or keeping secrets or leading me to a monster that I bet you knew I wasn’t ready for? It feels like - it’s just... annoying!” Sort of a lame finish; she lost her momentum towards the end.

                    “Wasn’t ready for?” Zeal responded, drifting down to sit atop the headrest. “It was chosen to be appropriate for your intended abilities at this point in training. The fact that your intent was insufficient to destroy it is due to your continuing insubordination with regards to morality.” A subtle shift in posture; a slight forward lean. “It is my task to ensure you are as effective a hero as possible, and accomplishing that goal requires my pupils to listen to me. The monster was chosen to demonstrate that your current approach is insufficient.”

                    Did he think that would make her feel <em>less</em> upset? Most of it was basically an accusation! “My current approach works just fine on the smaller ones I managed to deal with (mostly) on my own after the big one! If you could just be patient and give me a chance-” She cut herself off, realizing a potentially bigger concern. “Actually! You sent me in there on purpose to prove a point, you just said! I could have <em>died!</em> If a second hero hadn’t coincidentally been right nearby to help out, I probably would have! You even left me alone there; do you just not care what happens to me?”

                    Bria was having a hard time keeping her voice down at this point; she retrieved her phone to maybe look like she was just arguing with someone who wasn’t an invisible angel. No one <em>seemed</em> to be looking at her, but you never knew.

                    “The danger was controlled. Your risk of fatal injury was acceptably low.”

And how low is ‘acceptable’ - you didn’t ask me! Wait-” She remembered something. Justice had seemed a little weird when she mentioned Zeal, and Mahogany had guessed over text that the two angels might know each other. So, it might make sense if... “Do you know Justice? Did you ask him to be nearby so they could help if needed?” It <em>had</em> seemed like a pretty big coincidence that Mahogany had shown up at <em>exactly</em> the right time.

                    He raised his chin dismissively. “True or false; it does not matter. Other heroes and angels are none of your concern. You must focus on empowering yourself to avoid needing assistance in the first place.”

                    “That’s what I’m trying to do, but you don’t even want me to try unless it involves killing-”

                    This went on for a while. Back and forth without much progress, until eventually Zeal said he had something else to do and that he would be back tomorrow morning to start her training in partial transformations and - even more interesting - signature magic. The type of power that was unique between heroes, not just generic enhanced physical abilities or the bolts of unattuned magic that just about everyone could do. No, it would be something like Violet’s poison mist or Mahogany’s shapeshifting. Something uniquely Silver’s. Of course, Zeal couldn’t say what it would be and Bria obviously didn’t know, but they would find out soon. It worked a lot like the appearance of her battle form, he said, where the magic would reflect her conscious interpretation of the vision within her heart. Whatever that meant.

Why was it so hard to get along with him? Were all angels this stubborn about having to do things their way? Justice didn’t seem like that from the little she had talked with him, but - well - it had only been a little. Or maybe Justice and Mahogany were just more alike than her and Zeal.

                    <em>“Why do you think he was so effective?”</em> Zeal had asked earlier, about Mahogany. <em>“He holds killing intent. He delights in the act of eliminating evil from this world.”</em>

                    <em>Is that true?</em> she wondered, trying to recall how he had acted. He certainly hadn’t seemed too conflicted about killing monsters. But he also had way more experience than her, intent or not. It was probably impossible to know without asking or seeing him in action more.

                    Really, why was it so hard to try to be <em>heroic</em> rather than just being a hero?

                    Later that night, in her bedroom with the door blocked, Bria experimented with partial transformations without Zeal’s guidance. She became Silver, focused on a particular item she had been holding as Bria, and tried to bring just that part into her battle form. And it was certainly a good thing she hadn’t tried it out in the park, because it was very easy to slip up and change back entirely.

                    But it wasn’t as hard as he had implied. Either “he” - Zeal or Mahogany. Within the space of just a few hours’ practice (and staying up well into the next day), she was able to retrieve her phone, a hairbrush, a notepad, and even her nightshirt (replacing her hero dress) back from her base form. It still wasn’t a stable enough technique to feel comfortable doing in public (she ended up fully transforming back at least half the time), but it was a lot of progress. On her own, without needing a certain stubborn angel to explain anything.

                    <em>Scene 18</em>
                    <em>June 28th, 2028</em>

                    “Mornin’,” Vanity yawned, showing off her fangs. “It’s too early, isn’t it?”

                    “It’s afternoon,” Lillian reminded her. “What were you doing last...” She yawned too, covering her mouth with one hand. Vanity snickered. “Okay, that was just because yawns are contagious. I’m not tired.”

                    Rain speckled the train’s windows as it gained speed, heading west out of the city. It was past noon, more or less, and this was the first train she could have reasonably made after her obligations in the morning. But... “You think they’re still gonna be out there today even in this weather?”

                    Lillian winced lightly. “Look, the forecast said 30% chance and it was dry this morning. I would have waited if I’d known it would actually hit that 30%!” She shook her head. “No, they’re still going to be there. You said her angel’s a really tough one, right?”

                    “That’s what my sources say! An old grump, unlike your fresh, friendly, f...elpful friend!”

                    “Really had to f-orce that one, huh?”

                    “Shush. So, what’s your plan today?”

                    She stared out the window, trying to determine how thick the clouds were. It was no use; visibility was too poor to tell. “I’m going to fight her again. What else?”

                    Vanity hummed, doing a flip in midair as she drifted over to the window to see what Lillian was looking at. “But why? You’re not even going to steal anything?”

                    “It’s evil enough to be sneaking around like this, right? I don’t have to find a proper target as long as she actually pays attention this time. Which is why we’re going to find her instead of the other way around.”

                    “But you aren’t gonna get anything out of it, right?” Vani asked, obviously confused. “Fighting a hero isn’t, like, evil; that’s just why they’re here. I think it’d be easier to just do your normal thing. You’re good at it!”

Ah! How about- “It’s a <em>vanity</em> thing. I didn’t beat her last time - not really - so I need to prove that I can.”

                    “Hmmm...” the demon hummed. “Flattering! But I don’t buy it.”

                    “Wha - why not?”

                    “I can feel~ your intent!~” she half-sang. “Did ya forget that?~”

                    “...” Lillian shuffled in her seat. “It’s creepy how you guys can just feel emotions directly like that.”

                    “But useful!~”

                    “... Yeah. So, why am I doing it, then? Miss empath?”

                    “I’m not telling!~”

                    “Wh - they’re <em>my</em> emotions; what is not telling me going to do?”

                    “Maybe you just don’t know why yourself! And telling you would be cheating!”

                    “...” <em>No, I know why. And part of it really is pride, no matter what Vani says. But the other part...</em> “Hm? What’s up?” she asked, distracted from her thoughts by Vanity’s ears twitching as she pressed against the window.

                    “I feel a certain grumpy angel nearby!” she said happily. “Maybe I should go tell him to lighten up a bit!”

                    “No!” Lillian exclaimed. “Stay hidden, please! I don’t want him to know we’re here yet.”

                    “Ooh, a sneaky mission?” Vani twirled around in excitement, lowering out of view from outside. “You got it! Stealth mode on!”

                    “Good,” Lillian calmed down. “When we get there, can you lead me to the right area without him noticing?”

                    Vanity did a little salute. “Yes sir ma’am! But my accuracy isn’t very good with angels or heroes.”

                    “Then we’ll look around manually. But I don’t want to transform until I have to.”

                    “Really? But I thought you liked your battle form way better than your-”

                    “I do; it’s not about that! I just-” She paused, again trying to figure out how to explain. Why <em>was</em> she so adamant on making this a stealth mission, when she’d obviously have to reveal her presence to do the fight anyway? She wasn’t planning on doing an ambush or anything. “We’re gathering intel first. Strengths, weaknesses. I’m not going to lose again.”

                    “Why didn’t you?”

                    “Come on, you know why. I came straight from practice today.” A few more moments of slogging along the rough path in shoes absolutely not designed for that. She didn’t want to think about what it would take to clean them later. Honestly, it might be safer to just make up an excuse and come home barefoot than to reveal where she’d been. “But also, I didn’t think it was going to rain. Or that I’d be searching a whole park <em>while</em> it was raining.”

                    “At least it’s getting a little lighter?”

                    Lillian sighed, finally escaping the muck onto drier grassy dirt. “I’m glad you can be so positive. It’s actually weirdly encouraging.”

                    “It’s supposed to be encouraging! Why’s that weird?”

                    “Shh!” Lillian hissed suddenly, crouching down a little. “Do you hear that?”

                    A pause; raindrops pattered on leaves. But, ahead, a voice.

                    “Who else would be out here in the rain?” she whispered. “It has to be them.”

                    “Maybe!” Vanity didn’t have to be quiet, since only Lillian could hear her. “Be careful! Grumpy angels have really good hearing!”

                    “---” Lillian agreed, miming zipping up her mouth. She’d also have to come up with a reasonable excuse for what on earth she was doing if they did catch her. Maybe pretend to be a nature buff or a very lost jogger? No, her outfit didn’t support either of those stories. Or she could just transform now and not risk anything with her base form, but the angel would definitely notice. When she did transform, she had to be ready to fight. So, for now, just some regular old caution would have to be enough. Rain would mask the sound of her footsteps, at least.

Lights became visible through the trees, glittering silver on droplet-covered leaves. Success; it was her. Silver was facing slightly away from Lillian, focused on an invisible presence that was thus facing slightly towards her. The angel, probably; she shied back a little.

                    “Okay, ready,” Silver said, raising both hands. There was a pause as her angel presumably replied, then an assortment of small glowing orbs appeared in midair and rushed towards her.

                    Hands up and coated in discs of faint light; she reached for each orb in turn. And at her touch, they quickly reversed direction with a quiet ping. Well, most of them; there were far too many orbs for her to get them all and a few impacted with similarly quiet smacks.

                    <em>Reflection,</em> Lillian decided. <em>Her signature theme is “reflection” - it has to be. It fits; her outfit is like a bunch of mirrors!</em>

                    “Huh?” Silver asked after the volley was finished, starting to turn. “Over where?”

                    “!” The angel must have noticed way faster than expected! Lillian had to-

                    <em>Scene 19</em>
                    -run! Or hide? Lillian couldn’t decide whether to sprint back down the path to get away or press further back into the foliage to get out of sight, split the difference, and ended up slipping on a slick patch of mud. And... splat.

                    <em>Oh god no - just go!</em>

                    She scrambled to her feet and ran for it. Silver called out from the clearing: “Hey! Who’s there; can I help you?”

                    Lillian didn’t respond, but just took a few sliding turns to get out of immediate sight, then focused on trying to find the way out. She wasn’t being followed, it seemed, so she slowed down to avoid another fall and looked down to see how bad it was.

                    “Ouch,” Vanity commented, hovering overhead. “That’s a real mess!”

                    “... Yeah, it really is.” There was mud all over her clothes from ankle to waist and on the arm that broke her fall. She could maybe clean some of it off with rainwater or something, but it would be <em>super</em> obvious. Oh, this was a really big problem. Why hadn’t she just turned around when it started raining? Or at least been a little more careful? Lillian took a few deep breaths, trying to calm down and not think about what would happen if she went home looking like this. Forget fighting Silver for the moment; she had to solve <em>this</em> problem first. “Did you see, like, a laundromat or something?”

                    “Nope! But I bet there’s one somewhere!”

                    “...” Lillian sat down on a bench under a little shelter, trying to wipe away some of the muck with her hands and assistance from the rain. It wasn’t working very well; she gave up and tried to do the reverse, wiping the muck off her hands to use her phone properly. This was mortifying; maybe it would be worth it to become Violet just for a change of clothes, Silver’s presence or not. “I’d have to walk ten minutes, and buy new clothes on the way, and not mess them up too with some other stupid idea.”

                    “Or steal them!”

                    “I’m not in the mood today,” she sighed. “I’ve never felt less cool in my life.”

                    “Hey, over there!” someone called. “Are you okay?”

                    Lillian froze, then slowly turned back towards the almost-forest. A familiar, all-too-silvery hero was jogging towards her. Vanity had the nerve to fully laugh at the predicament, though at least she also had the decency to stifle it. “... Me?” she asked, trying to play dumb.

                    Silver made it under the roof as well, dry despite the weather. A few straggling raindrops pinged off her hair. Reflection magic. “Are you the person I startled in the woods back there? I’m really sorry, especially if I made you slip. I was just practicing my magic; I didn’t think anyone else would be out here today!”

                    Turning to the side slightly as if to hide the enormous mud splatter, Lillian tried to salvage <em>anything</em> from this mess. At least she had been handed a ready-made excuse. “I-I’m fine. I didn’t expect to find a hero back there either; I guess I thought you might have been a villain?”

                    “O-oh! Sorry again! I’m Silver; I’m sort of new around here. But I’m a hero for sure, so don’t be scared if you see me again!”

                    “Right. I... won’t. Now, I’ll just be going...”

                    Silver noticed the mud. She would have had to be blind not to. “Er, can I help with all that mud somehow? Do you need a towel or some new clothes or something?”

                    “It’s fine; I was just going to buy more and wash these.”

                    “Oh, let me help! I can help pay for it; I feel bad because it was my fault.”

                    <em>It wasn’t - no, this is good. Right? Wasn’t I trying to learn more about her?</em> “... Okay, if you want.” She couldn’t stop herself from adding, “But it wasn’t your fault.”

                    “No, I should have told someone or at least been paying more attention. If I had been doing more dangerous magic, I could have actually hurt someone if they showed up like that! Maybe I should put up a sign or something.”

                    “Oh, you saw that?” Silver remarked, faintly embarrassed for some reason. “My angel likes to use that spell to have me deal with a lot of attacks at once. I’m still working on it... as you saw.”

                    <em>Oh, is it because she got hit a lot?</em> “I think you did pretty well.” A breath; rain pattered on the umbrella she had gotten in the city while changing trains. Droplets just bounced off Silver; she had no need of one. “Your reflection magic is pretty cool; how does it work?”

                    “Thanks! I’m just learning it, but so far I can sort of coat my body in a reflective layer, or put it just on my hands for more power. The whole-body thing can only stop stuff like raindrops for now, but maybe I can make it stronger later.”

                    “Does it do anything for things bigger than raindrops?” Lillian asked to know for her own attacks, but also out of legitimate curiosity. “And what about smaller things, like air?” <em>Or poison mist, for instance?</em>

                    “Hmm, bigger things seem to just go through, but I don’t know if they’re affected at all. And smaller things - um...” She glanced up and to the right, presumably at the invisible angel. But... “Wh - he was just here! Sorry, I don’t know either. I guess it probably doesn’t do anything or I might not be able to breathe?”

                    “‘He’? Your angel?” Lillian intended to ask, but instead her question somehow came out as “Can I try to poke you?”

                    “What?”

                    <em>Why did I-?</em> “T-to see if bigger things are affected! My hand is bigger than a raindrop!”

                    “Oh! Sure, I don’t mind.” Silver lifted her arm a little, offering it for poking. “Tell me if you feel a force or anything.”

There was a slight resistance as her finger got close, but she was able to easily break through and successfully complete the poke. Her arm was surprisingly warm despite the chill rain - or maybe Lillian’s finger was just cold. “Y-yes, there’s a force. It feels like... like holding a weak magnet the wrong way, but not enough to stop me.”

                    “Huh; neat!” Silver looked at her arm and gave it a poke herself. “I don’t feel anything when I do it, so maybe the magic is excluding me by default? It’s so weird how intent works with signature magic; it’s so different from unattuned spells! Oh, sorry, that’s just the terms for magic that’s unique to me and magic that just about all heroes can do.”

                    Lillian quickly shut her mouth and muttered “Ah, thanks.” She had definitely been about to respond like she knew exactly what Silver was talking about - because she obviously did! But she had to remember she wasn’t Violet right now, so she couldn’t act like she knew all that much about heroes, angels, or magic. <em>Just don’t be suspicious. I’m learning so much about her powers; just don’t blow it!</em>

                    With that thought in mind, Lillian tried to focus on the more immediate objectives rather than directly interrogating Silver. To start with, that meant finding some new clothes.

                    The top was easy; even in this relatively quiet suburb, there were plenty of random souvenir or graphic t-shirts available all over downtown. But for whatever reason, souvenir or graphic t-<em>shorts</em> (what would that even mean?), or just regular pants, weren’t as common. Still, it wasn’t an impossible task and Silver was able to point out a smallish general store nearby that she remembered having something in stock a while ago. This turned out to be correct, which meant both the acquisition of a pair of stretchy, lounge-like sweatpants, and that Silver (or whatever her real name was) probably lived in this town. That had already been pretty likely given this was where she practiced all the time, but it was more evidence.

                    “You look good!” Silver decided after Lillian emerged from the changing room (the bathroom) in her new clothes. Nondescript grey sweatpants and a black graphic tee with a stylized lake and forest scene on it, if you were wondering.

                    “You don’t have to say anything; I know this is a dumb outfit.”

                    “No, I mean it! You look...” Silver searched for the right word. “Cozy?” A little half-chuckle. “But I guess anyone would look more cozy without being covered in mud.”

                    “... Y-yeah. That’s right.”

                    Then, it was time to load up the washing machine, do a quick search online for how to safely wash shoes since Lillian belatedly realized she had never done that before, and sit around for a while. Well, after picking out the most secluded spot they could find, since Silver stood out and didn’t want to disturb everyone.

                    Speaking of Silver, she stuck around for some reason even though there wasn’t an obvious reason for her to. “I know this is a little awkward, by the way, but I don’t think I ever got your name?”

I’m-” A hesitation, but only a brief one. “-Lillian.” Not wanting to be asked anything else (like what she was doing here in the first place), she continued speaking. “By the way, are you done with training for the day? Do you not have to go back instead of just sitting here?” And a last-minute addition: “I don’t mind, but...”

                    Silver exhaled. “I don’t know where my angel is and he probably won’t show up again for a while even if I did go back. I can’t do as much training without him, and it’s kind of nice to take a break anyway.”

                    “What a lazy jerk! You’re too good for him!” Vanity called from somewhere above, invisible and inaudible to everyone except Lillian. “I’ll get him good when he shows up!”

                    She tried very hard not to react to that. “Does he do that often? Just disappear?”

                    “Ugh, yes! All the time; I can never get ahold of him when I need help! I really wonder if all angels are like that or if we just don’t get along for some reason.”

                    <em>Careful. Don’t give anything away.</em> Overhead, Vanity continued insulting Silver’s anonymous angel in an escalating variety of ways. Lillian did her best to block out the noise. “I don’t think so. I haven’t heard of many heroes not getting along. Is it just disappearing or is there more?”

                    “He doesn’t listen to me, doesn’t trust me to do anything right, and keeps telling me to do things only the way he wants instead of the way that works for me. We’re both getting kinda fed up with it. But if he’d just trust me to be my <em>own</em> kind of hero instead of <em>his</em>-” She cut herself off. “I... probably shouldn’t be saying all this. Especially not in the middle of a laundromat. Could you, uh, just forget you heard all that?”

                    “... He kinda sounds like the worst kind of helicopter parent. Obviously not literally, but... do I ever know that feeling.”

                    “You do?”

                    “Yeah. Didn’t you wonder why I wanted to wash my clothes <em>here</em> instead of just taking them home in a bag?”
                    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1332545223032836171 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1332545223032836171><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, January 24, 2025 9:58 PM">9:58 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Maybe a little, but I thought you just didn’t like your new outfit?”

                    “... Maybe it is a <em>little</em> cozy - anyway, no, they just <em>cannot</em> find out I came out here and got covered in mud. I don’t even know what they would think I had been doing, but it couldn’t be anything good.”

                    “Sorry; that sounds tough. I know it would be really hard for me to be a hero if my parents were like that.”

                    <em>You have no idea,</em> she silently agreed. Windows of time to get out of the house as Violet for any significant duration were difficult to find - Wednesdays right after practice were usually her best bet, which was why she had come here two Wednesdays in a row. That was also why a lot of her villainous escapades were confined to the area around her hometown, which caused its own set of problems. But Silver definitely didn’t need to know any of that. “I can imagine. You must be out training a lot.”

                    “Every day, more or less. It’s a lot of work, but I think it’s worth it. Destroying monsters; defeating villains... someone has to protect people.” A pause; she looked away. “Soon, I’ll be strong enough to make a real difference.”

                    “...”

                    “... Maybe I should keep training, even if Zeal’s not here.”

                    “It’s okay to take a break if you want to,” Lillian suggested. “It’s not healthy to spend all your time trying to please some overbearing parent or angel.”

                    “... Yeah, but I kinda want to keep going on this magic for <em>my</em> sake too.”

                    “Well then do it! As long as <em>you</em> want to.”

                    “...”

                    “Or don’t; you can always start pushing again tomorrow. We’re not even a third through summer break yet; there’s plenty of time left before school in the fall.”

                    “... Right. The fall.”

                    “Are you not a big fan of it, then?” Her tone certainly hadn’t implied so.

                    “N-no; that’s not really it. School’s fine. I’m just starting college this fall, so it’s going to be a big change with moving and new classes and people and all that on top of my hero duties - it’s just a lot all at once.”

                    “Oh. Are you going out of state, then?” For some reason, the idea didn’t appeal.

                    “Actually, just downtown. But it’s still a big change from... here!”

                    “Oh! Y-yeah, it is.” Unexpected relief. She shouldn’t care, really; she barely knew Silver the hero and didn’t know her real self at all. But where else was she going to find someone willing to fight her who wasn’t way too strong? Thinking of fighting, actually, Lillian was somewhat surprised to realize she didn’t really want to. It had been hours and Silver was actually pretty nice and it would just feel weird to turn around and try to beat up this person who had just spent so much effort trying to help her when she hadn’t really needed to at all. Even if Silver wouldn’t know Violet was the same person, it would still feel weird to Violet.

                    ... She’d have to think about this more.

Silver and Lillian didn’t really do anything of note; just sat around and chatted about this and that. School, heroes, parents, angels, but also much more important topics like music or a certain recently-released and very controversial novel. Somehow, despite ostensibly being enemies, it just felt comfortable to Lillian. “Cozy,” perhaps, as Silver had said. It just wasn’t very often she got to sit around like this without any looming deadline beyond the train that would take her home.

                    “I guess I’m putting a lot of trust in that anti-recognition enchantment,” Silver admitted sheepishly as they prepared to leave. “Probably shouldn’t have said nearly as much as I did, but you’re just... easy to talk to? If I wasn’t transformed, I’d probably ask for your number or something.”

                    “Yeah; I don’t usually like to talk about my home situation too much either, but today it was fine.” She hesitated awkwardly, debating saying that they could exchange numbers anyway, but eventually decided against it. Mixing hero and regular identities like that was a recipe for disaster for both of them. If only she could have a conversation like that as Violet then everything would be fine! Or if Silver had transformed back - whatever.

                    “Well, I guess I’ll get going. Hopefully everything’s fine when you get home. I can’t tell there was any mud there, if that helps.”

                    Lillian looked down at her outfit again, even though she had checked it meticulously a few times already. “I think it’s as good as it’s going to get. They probably won’t notice anything.” Another pause; how did you end a conversation? They both had places to be! “... Thanks for helping out. I’ll, uh, go catch my train now.”

It was an uneventful ride into the city, an uneventful transfer, and an uneventful (though busier) ride back out in a different direction. Then she just had to walk over half an hour from the station back to her house on the quieter side of town. She probably would have been expected to take a cab or call for a pickup instead of going all the way herself, but her parents only begrudgingly allowed her to take the train at all and she worried that making it more inconvenient for them might cut off even that lifeline. At least she only had to do this coming back, as the studio was much closer to the station and she got driven there.

                    “Go wash up before dinner, Lillian,” her mother instructed her when she finally got back. “And do be more careful; signs of exertion are unladylike.”

                    And that was it. As expected, she had only been reprimanded about how tired she looked after all her walking (though mother probably expected she had been doing extra practice or something, not returning from the train station). Nothing about the just-barely visible remnants of her fall. She had gotten away with it.

                    “You didn’t do anything evil today,” Vanity noted from somewhere near the ceiling. “You didn’t even transform!”

                    It was much later and Lillian’s room was dark, so it was difficult to pick out the demon amidst the shadows. “I got a lot of information on an enemy through a secret mission; I think that’s pretty evil.”

                    “Hmmmm...” she considered. “Nope! It’s only evil if you’re gonna be evil with that info!”

                    “And who says I’m not?”

                    “Me! You didn’t even want to fight her today, after all the complaining you did saying you wanted to. All week!”

                    Lillian rolled over in bed, her reply now a little muffled. “Look, it just... wasn’t the right time. After being with her all day, it just - wasn’t right.”

                    “But the fun of evil is that you get to break the rules! It doesn’t have to be right to do it.”

                    “Wasn’t right for me, not in general. I’ll get her next time for sure.”

C’mon, get a good scheme going! Give me something <em>fun</em> to watch, or to help you with! Don’t just roll around like a... a rolling pin!”

                    She peeked up a little, trying to see Vani’s expression after the weird way she had said that. No luck; too dark. “Okay, okay. I’ll do something actually evil. Just let me think about it a little...”

                    <em>Scene 22</em>
                    <em>June 29th, 2028</em>

                    “Yo, Rod,” Hugo said, waving him over. “You better have a good excuse for bein’ so late.”

                    “Do I ever,” Roderik sighed as he sat down, sliding his backpack onto the bench. They usually met up for Taco Thursday at this very restaurant to take advantage of the weekly specials, but today he was over half an hour late. Hugo, he noted, had started without him. Guy had a bottomless stomach.

                    “You’re lookin kinda not-great,” Hugo observed. “Get into a fight on the way here or something?”

                    “Yes, surprisingly. And I’ll tell you all about it <em>after</em> I place an order. Just a minute.”

                    “Really? Not jokin’ around? Aaand he’s gone.” Hugo considered his options, then decided to get more food himself. Obviously it wouldn’t do to leave his friend the only one eating.

                    A bit later, returned to their seats and refilled on tacos, Hugo prepared to get the details. “Alright, fill me in. What happened? Who started it?”

                    “Okay, but keep it down. I know it’s loud in here, but-”

                    “Oh ho ho! It’s one of those fights.”

                    He semi-shrugged. “Yes, it’s one of those fights. What, do you think I’d get into a punch-up myself? No, it was a villain.”

                    “One I’ve heard of?”

                    “I doubt it; I hadn’t until tonight. Listen, do you want to hear what happened or do you want to keep interrupting?”

                    “Go on; I’ll shut up.” Hugo stuffed half a taco into his mouth to prove he could be quiet.

                    “Okay. I was heading here when Vigil sensed a villain nearby, around the north side of downtown. So I had to go check it out, obviously, and I was just in time to hear a really loud burst of wind, metal clanging, and a few seconds of an alarm before it shut off.”

                    “Daylight robbery?” Hugo mumbled almost unintelligibly through his mouthful of food.

                    “Chew,” Roderik reminded him. “When I got over there, I found a side door blasted open and a villain inside looking like she didn’t expect it to be so loud.”

                    “She said ‘Damn, guess it really was that loud’ when I showed up.”

                    “She? You find another cute girl to be your new nemesis?”

                    “I keep telling you; it wasn’t - whatever. And, no, I doubt she’s going to be <em>my</em> nemesis, because she won our fight handily. She was like a rocker girl type - piercings, crop top; like you’d see in a band - and her attacks were all sound-based. Shockwaves and such; my magic wouldn’t be a good counter even if we were on similar power levels. But the fact that she can summon a weapon means she’s even more advanced than you, let alone me.”

                    “Dude, you mean <em>I</em> can have a cute girl as my new nemesis?”

                    “You know what? Go for it. I’m rooting for you, buddy.”

                    “Hell yeah,” Hugo said solemnly. “But I’m gonna need more deets than that. Place? Motive? Powers?”

                    “North side of downtown, like I said. It was at a store that sold instruments - guess it matches her theme - so I’ll just send you the address. I’m betting it was a simple robbery since the store was closed at the time, but I don’t know why she didn’t wait till night at least. And I would bet she’s going to try again somewhere nearby sometime soon, after dark this time.”

                    “She tell you that too?”

                    “No, but the police showed up shortly after our battle and she had to leave empty-handed. I doubt she was pleased about that, and she certainly seemed confident enough to give it a second attempt.”

                    “Huh, runs from the cops but not from a hero? Weird.”

                    “Ask her yourself. Maybe she could tell I wasn’t a match for her.”

                    “Hm.” The police were certainly aware of heroes and villains, and had some technological countermeasures if they were responding to a related call, but unless a full special-response squad had been dispatched, Roderik would certainly have been the bigger threat. Or, well, Granite. Roderik wouldn’t be caught dead engaging in fisticuffs; he was far too polite for that.

So you’ll want to head for your right - my left - for the best shot of dodging, I think.”

                    “Dude, it’s super obvious you have never picked up a guitar. Honestly, are you even sure it wasn’t a bass or something?”

                    “... Ask her yourself,” he repeated.

                    “I will! But, right, yeah? Thanks. I’ll avenge you.”

                    “Do your best. And try to alert the police ahead of time, if you can. Apparently that could be an advantage for you.”

                    “Yes, chief!” A bit of a pause; he clearly considered the topic closed. But then, something else occurred to him. “Hey, speaking of cute girls with superpowers, you’ll never guess who I met on Saturday...”

                    ...
                    <em>July 1st, 2028</em>

                    Mahogany yawned deeply, letting his legs swing off the roof into open air. It was just past midnight on Friday night, which he supposed meant it was technically Saturday now. What a way to start his weekend: on stakeout. “Anything yet, J?”

                    “Nothing nearby,” the angel replied, amusing himself nearby by shuffling a pack of playing cards. Justice claimed he was learning how to play solitaire and that meant he had to know how to shuffle. Mahogany didn’t know what to make of that, but if it made him happy, it was fine with him. “I do sense a pair of powerful heroes locked in battle near the docks, however.”

                    “The docks again?” he grumbled. “What’s so popular about the docks? They should know Mr Blue-Fish hangs out there all the time.”

                    “Perhaps they are wishing to fight Aquamarine,” Justice guessed. “Any hero of darkness capable of defeating him would earn a great deal of fame.”

                    “Pah. Not a chance. He’s on a whole ‘nother level.”

                    “I wouldn’t be so sure...”

The dude’s this city’s number one hero; he hasn’t lost a fight in years!”

                    “His powers rely on water,” Justice said, spraying cards all across the rooftop with a look of mild disappointment. “Take it away and he becomes powerless. It’s surely no accident that he spends so much time by the lake.”

                    “Well, sure, but good luck getting him somewhere with <em>no</em> water,” Mahogany countered, picking up a few cards that had slid over near him. “There’s the lake, sure, but also the river, ponds, sewers, main pipes, water fountains; hell, I bet he could use the water inside a human body if he wanted to. Dude’s probably just too ‘good’ to do it.”

                    “Perhaps. But the mighty <em>do</em> fall.”

                    “... You’re bein’ kinda weird tonight; you know that?”

                    “Your target is nearby.”

                    “What kinda response is - wait, what?” Mahogany scrambled to his feet, narrowly avoiding falling off the building. “The rocker chick? She’s here?”

                    “Based on Vigilance’s description of her aura, I believe so,” Justice clarified, shoving all the cards into a little kangaroo-like pouch he manifested sometimes if he needed to carry things. “I believe you will shortly be given a more significant direction.”

                    “No need; I did my research.”

                    “Research? You?”

                    “I know; I know. I’m turnin’ over a new leaf.” Mahogany shifted his arms into large, membranous wings. Insufficient for extended flight, but very good for gliding. “C’mon; it’ll be right down the street. If I’m right, that is.”

                    <em>Scene 23</em>
                    The two of them slowly descended over the length of a block, Mahogany shifting his ears to increase their sensitivity along the way. And that shift was immediately proven useful when he picked out a muffled crack followed by a few clinks - like the shattered glass of a broken window, for instance. “Heh, right where I thought. Better hurry.”

                    He maneuvered into a dive and landed not long after, shifting back to his normal form. “See?” he asked Justice, pointing out the jagged hole in a nearby glass storefront. String instruments lined a display just inside. “I checked it out ahead of time. I can be responsible when I want to be!”

                    “Very impressive,” Justice agreed. “But where is our perpetrator?”

                    “Inside, I bet. Let’s go make friends.”

                    He hopped through the same hole, vaulting the display counter to land in the empty shop itself. No lights; no sound. “Hiding?” he asked at a normal volume. “Hey, where’s the villain who broke that window? Come on out; we gotta talk about what you did to my buddy.”

                    “...” They both listened for a few seconds. “Nothing, really? You afraid or something? Come on, get out here. I’m not gonna leave till you do.”

                    Another few seconds of silence. “Well, damn. Guess I’m playing hide and seek.”

                    Mahogany walked further into the shop, peeking behind the counter and into a few of the aisles. No one was around, though there were a few more doors. And, interestingly, one was cracked open. “Back room?” he wondered aloud, pulling it open to reveal a steep, narrow staircase. “Guess not.”

Rustling, clattering. Like an energetic squirrel, or a burglar. He shifted some muscle mass around to prepare for a fight as he emerged at the top, past another open door, to find himself in a ransacked studio-looking area. Soundproofing, miscellaneous equipment, and just general junk had been thrown all over the place. And, hearing his footsteps and peeking out of a smaller practice room, was exactly who he had been looking for.

                    “Sup,” he said casually. “Name’s Mahogany, or just Hog if you like. My buddy’s Justice. We’re here to stop you.”

                    The villain looked to be about Mahogany’s age, with a few vibrant blue streaks through her spiky brown hair and startlingly yellow eyes (part of the transformation, he assumed). She was dressed in the sort of punk-esque outfit that Rod had reported: crop top, skinny jeans, belts and spikes and the like. Pretty abnormally normal as far as hero outfits were concerned; honestly, he wasn’t even sure if she was transformed at all until a gorgeous, metallic blue guitar materialized from a mass of light and dropped into her hands. Definitely a guitar, not a bass; Rod hadn’t messed that up.

                    Cooler than he had even imagined. “Woah. Hold up, maybe I’ll back up on that ‘here to stop you’ thing long enough to get your name at least?”

                    She shifted her grip on the guitar, resting her fingers on the strings. Glittering eddies of light formed into a similarly metallic blue pick as she did so. “Lapis. Now turn around and leave if you know what’s good for you.”

                    “Lapis; sweet. You come here often?”

                    “Is that a real question-”

                    “Well, I heard you ‘stopped by’ a shop down the road just a few days ago. Ya like music?”

                    Lapis briefly glanced down at her guitar. “... Is <em>that</em> a real question?”

                    “Just making conversation. I’m here to avenge my buddy from Thursday, but we can have a chat first.”

That guy didn’t stand a chance and you won’t either. Last warning; get out or it won’t be fun for you.”

                    “I bet it will.” He shifted a bit more mass into his arms; the distance was close enough to not need too much speed. Just enough to duck to the right. Wait, whose right? What had Rod said...? “You just here to steal instruments, by the way? Why? You’ve already got a super cool one.”

                    “Obviously I can only use it when transformed!” Lapis played a single chord concurrently with the last word, releasing a blast of jagged, electric sound straight at Mahogany. He leapt diagonally aside, further into the-

                    “Wh-oof!” He wasn’t close to fast enough and the shockwave caught him off-center in the chest, throwing him down the stairs and crashing back to the first floor. “Damn,” he muttered, picking himself up. “He wasn’t kidding; she’s quick.”

                    “I can be even quicker!” Lapis shouted from the second floor, strumming another heavy blast down the stairs.

                    This one, Mahogany managed to avoid because he had already been halfway out of the door back into the main shop. Wooden boards strained and brickwork trembled with the vibrations. <em>I probably shouldn’t leave the store,</em> he decided. <em>It’s wide open out there and her range is way better than mine. But if I can just get up close and get that guitar away from her...</em>

                    “Get back here!” she yelled from the staircase. “Thought you weren’t scared!”

                    “Never said that!” he called back, retreating to the nearest aisle and preparing to snatch. “Just that I’d have fun!”

                    Footsteps. Coming closer; closer...

                    “Ha!” He leapt out of hiding, wrestling the guitar to the side with his shifted strength. Lapis let go to avoid being thrown aside with it - the instrument had no strap probably for situations like this - and then simply screamed at him.

To add insult to injury, the guitar he had been holding that whole tumble was unharmed and had ended up in his lap in the perfect position to play. Unfortunately, he had no idea how to. Plus, it probably wouldn’t work for him.

                    “Ready to calm the hell down and admit you’re in over your head?” she asked smugly, strutting confidently forward to lean over him, one hand on the guitar’s neck. “I’ll beat as many heroes as it takes till you all leave me alone!”

                    She tugged at the guitar, but Mahogany held it tightly. “Oh, you want this back? Guess you’d better-” A sudden shift let him shoulder Lapis away, tossing her inelegantly into a shelf, and run for the window while redirecting mass to his legs and still clutching her guitar. “-come get it!” <em>Having a weapon may make you more powerful, but it sure makes for a big weakness when you can’t defend it!</em>

                    The guitar dissolved back into light.

                    Mahogany stopped on the sidewalk, turning around to see Lapis peeking out of the broken window. “I can summon it back, dumbass,” she politely informed him. “You can’t steal it.”

                    “Ah,” he elegantly replied. “So that’s how it works.” Honestly, he hadn’t fought a villain with a weapon before. Most of his work was dark spirits and they didn’t follow the same rules.

                    “Yeah, it is. Can you fuck off now and let me get back to it?”

                    <em>Scene 24</em>
                    “No can do, I’m afraid. But I’d be okay with <em>you</em> leaving if you promise not to do it again.”

                    Lapis scoffed from the window. “You haven’t hit me once and you think I’m gonna run?”

                    “Hey! I knocked you into the shelf like a minute ago!”

                    “Doesn’t count; didn’t hurt. Come on, tough guy, can’t you do any better?”

                    Mahogany considered his options as she carefully climbed out of the window to face him, guitar reappearing with a glitter of light. He could charge her right now without thinking about it, but he didn’t <em>really</em> fancy his chances, despite his words. Even up close, if she could just yell and throw him that far? Ideally, he could convince her to leave peacefully, but diplomacy wasn’t his strong suit. He didn’t even know why she was stealing instruments at all! Wait, maybe-

                    “Look, why are you here at all? You just want a guitar for yourself? I can maybe-”

                    “Shut up!” Another blast of harsh sound, followed up by several more notes forming the intro to a vaguely familiar melody. All angled to catch him no matter which way he went, except...

                    “Hup!” With a full shift to his legs, Mahogany leapt straight up with enough power to crack the sidewalk beneath him. And even still, despite his incredible speed, the first blast caught his feet and spun him crazily in midair. Another rapid shift added wings to his legs instead of his arms - it would take too long to move the mass all the way up there - and he ended up with an unstable variant of the glider from before, angling down towards Lapis.

                    “Bank left,” Justice whispered an invisible suggestion, darting past his ear in the lightning-bolt guise. He didn’t think about it; just hurled himself in that direction... and dodged another set of powerful notes by inches; shuddering vibrations rippled through his wing membranes. “And dive.”

Another miss, but now he was hurtling towards the ground at a frankly concerning speed. And he definitely hadn’t practiced with leg-wings nearly as much as the regular sort. Mahogany banked up, shifting the wings away and converting them into more of a smooth, armored plating. <em>This’ll hurt a little,</em> he prepared himself.

                    Like a curled-up armadillo, he hit the ground with a tumbling spin. Protective plates shifted into place across his body as he rolled, replacing the immediate pain with a strange rumble - as if he were a tire on a rough road.

                    He grinned a little as Lapis reacted to his tactics - “What the hell-?!” - and then focused on strengthening the plates further as she surely would get into position in time for one more blast.

                    He heard it, but didn’t feel anything. <em>She missed? How?</em> But then it made sense, as he rolled on a little longer than planned. He should have hit her by now - uncurl; re-anaylze.

                    Lapis was standing a dozen feet away diagonally, outfit still settling as if she had just landed from a high leap - probably propelled by her last shockwave. He was uncurling a bit past her previous position and now stood in the middle of the street. Good thing there wasn’t much traffic at this time of night.

                    He grinned, catching his breath after the repeated rapid shifting. “That any better? I think I’m figuring you out.”

                    “What the hell is your theme?” she asked warily. “Mutations?”

                    “Shapeshifting,” he declared proudly. “And it doesn’t have’ta be super obvious like I just did; it can get real delicate too. Wonder how I heard you from so far away earlier? Shifted ears.”

                    “...” A slight change of footing. “Not gonna save you.”

                    “Oh yeah?” An idea occurred to him; a way to get out of this without having to beat her up. “How ‘bout this: you hit me with your strongest shot, and I’ll prove I can shrug it off no problem. Then you give up and leave. Sound good?”

                    “Fuck off; I just don’t wanna get charged with murder. That’s a quick way to get Aquamarine on my ass.”

                    “Oh, so you’re scared of <em>him</em> but not of <em>me?</em> Come on, give it your best shot. Promise I won’t die!”

                    “Are you sure it is wise to anger her like this?” Justice whispered in his ear, still invisible. “Do you truly have that much confidence in your constitution?”

                    He winked, murmuring a response. “Gotta have faith, J. I’ve got a plan.”

                    “Y’know what?” she shouted. “Fine! No dodging; just hold still. If you’re still standing, I’ll give up. But if not, you can’t bother me again. Got it?”

                    A thumbs up. “Works for me!”

                    Lapis breathed out; focused. Mahogany smiled; shifted.

                    She played a full song.

                    Well, the first verse of one. Mahogany didn’t recognize it, unlike the partial melody from earlier, but he kind of wanted to listen to it properly later when it wasn’t trying to kill him. Strong guitar lead (obviously), but with enough missing identity to imply the existence of several other parts. Original? Was she in a band?

                    Anyway, he had to focus on surviving the blast before appreciating the composition. Hearing was stifled dramatically and he shifted most of his body mass forward into a set of thick, angled armor plates to break and deflect as much of the impact as possible. Behind that, flexible connection points to absorb any remaining vibrations and cushion the vital organs he couldn’t move or change without damaging them. He even anchored himself to the pavement with a set of fine, chitinous hooks to avoid being thrown clear across the road.

                    Of all the things to give way in this setup, he honestly didn’t expect it to be the <em>street.</em>

He had enough presence of mind to curl and angle properly, adding a little more protection to his relatively unarmored back, but he didn’t have much mass or time to work with - it was always harder to make or dissolve armor and bone than more flexible muscle and flesh. He did in fact go clear across the street, slamming improbably into a street sign on the other side and bending the metal severely. Armor cracked, but not bones. His protection did its job and by the time Lapis finally concluded her guitar solo, he was still alive and kicking.

                    “Ha!” he called across the street, taking in the ripped-up pavement and storefronts littered with chunks of broken concrete as he slowly got up. “Still standing! Guess you aren’t as strong as you think!”

                    “Oh yeah? What do you call what you were just doing, then? On the ground?”

                    He looked down. “Really? You’re gonna say you won just because the <em>road</em> gave out?”

                    The angel appeared in the middle of the street, hovering serenely over the destruction. “I’m afraid the wording was ambiguous. Neither of you specified a timeframe during which Hog had to be standing in order to be considered successful. I may suggest considering the contest invalid and ensuring a proper set of rules for a future repetition.”

                    “Was that really helping?” Mahogany muttered, but Lapis seemed to agree.

                    “Fine; neither one of us has to leave. But you’re looking pretty hurt and I’m all fresh. And you still haven’t hit me even once! You <em>sure</em> you want to keep going?”

He had blocked a good portion of the impact, but between the magic itself, hitting the street sign, and all the shifting to avoid damage, he was close to spent.

                    “...”

                    She didn’t respond before both of them heard something else: the rapidly-approaching sound of emergency vehicle sirens.

                    “I guess that was pretty damn loud,” Mahogany decided. “Okay, I’m willin’ to fight some more till the cops show up. In fact, lemme start!”

                    He jogged forward, slowly returning to his normal form as he had a feeling he’d need to transform back pretty soon. Once Lapis-

                    “Fine! Hell; <em>you</em> explain this to them.” She dissolved the guitar back into light, then ran into the alley right next to the instrument shop. Mahogany didn’t give chase; she’d transform back as soon as she got out of sight and he’d never be able to find her. Plus, even if he did, she might very well beat him. Ow. He found himself grinning again as he decided what to do next. God, she was great.

                    <em>Scene 25</em>
                    Mahogany did consider staying to explain to the cops; he really did. But they really loved to make him do too much paperwork and it was late and he was very tired after the fight. They’d figure it out without him. With that thought, he ducked into a nearby doorway, checked for cameras, and changed back to his base form. Then, Hugo departed the scene moments before the first few cop cars arrived. Right now, he just wanted to go to sleep.

                    ...

                    “Anyone looking?” Lillian whispered, poised quietly at her bedroom door.

                    “Nope! All clear!” Vani answered, excited for the heist. “You should have a minute or two.”

                    Lillian nodded, eased open the door, and closed it just as silently. Then it was a quick but careful tip-toe down the stairs, across the dark, still house, through the garage, and finally out the side door into the humid and still annoyingly warm night air. She locked it behind her and hustled out to the street, finally returning to a normal walking pace after turning a corner to get out of any possible sightlines. “Phew. But now we have to hurry. The bus is...” She fumbled through her bag in the semi-dark between streetlights while half-jogging. “... Four minutes away. I can make that.”

                    “Go! Run for it!” Vani egged her on from above, yelling as loud as she wanted without having to fear attracting any attention.

                    Lillian tried to be a little more discreet, jogging with a balance between speed and stealth. But she really did not want to miss the bus, so speed won out as it got closer and closer to the stop on her tracker. It wasn’t stopping at all, which made sense at this time of night. It was well past 11pm; no one would be on board. She normally wouldn’t be on board either, and her parents <em>definitely</em> wouldn’t approve. Going out alone? At night? In the dark? Taking (gasp) <em>public transport?</em> No way, no how.

                    She just didn’t tell them. It worked as long as she was careful.

A tap, a beep, and off she went, alone aside from the driver (who thankfully didn’t seem the chatty type).

                    She caught her breath in the back, checking the timetables once more to make sure she’d be able to get home. The 1:44am departure still showed as “on time,” though the actual vehicle hadn’t even left its origin yet. That was the last one until the morning; if she missed it, she’d be stuck walking home in the dead of night for possibly hours. Lillian hadn’t bothered researching just how long it would take. She’d make that bus.

                    Vanity kept bouncing around near the ceiling, muttering something about bread. Lillian didn’t say anything; she was busy planning and also didn’t want to seem crazy in case the driver looked back to check on her. At least this way, swiping through timetables and maps on her phone, she’d look the part of a... what stereotype <em>did</em> she resemble right now? Hopefully not a suspicious one.

                    She got off the bus at the annoyingly-named “Marketplace Corner” stop, which was neither a marketplace nor a corner, then walked another few minutes across the gigantic parking lot to the market the stop ostensibly served: the town’s biggest (and only) general supermarket box store. 11:50pm exactly; just under two hours to enact her evil plan and make it back to the bus stop on the other side of the street. Not for the first time, she wished Violet’s powers included flight, teleportation, or at least super speed. But aside from the enhanced endurance that made it easier to run for longer, no such luck.

                    “Okay,” she said to Vani, hurrying into the store before it closed in just 10 minutes. “Let’s do this.”

She spotted an employee once, but a little application of her new technique - “Sleep mist!” - took care of that and it was like she’d never been here at all.

                    “Do you think it’s like falling asleep or like passing out?” Vani wondered overhead as Violet continued walking. “When you get ‘em with the mist?”

                    “Want me to try it on you and find out?~”

                    “Hehehe! It wouldn’t work! But maybe try it on you~ later - it could help you go to bed after a tiring night of evil schemes!”

                    She considered the potential application as a sleep aid, but filed that away for later as she pushed through one of the large doors into the stock room. “If I read the schedule right, the truck we want should be arriving in... ten minutes. More or less.”

                    “Gonna find somewhere to hide or just take ‘em all out?” Vani made fake martial-arts movements in the air, chopping and kicking at imaginary enemies. “Kapow! Sleepytime!”

                    “I’d prefer to hide, if I can. I don’t want to alert any of the security guys too early; I bet they remember me from last time.”

                    “You think they’ll have guns this time?!~”

                    “...” She quietly doubted it - that seemed probably illegal? - but they were <em>really</em> mad last time. “Let’s hope not,” she decided. “That might be a little much for me.”

                    “No way! You can take ‘em! Shapow! Bang! Poison gas!”

                    “Did you take a caffeine pill or something? You’re even more hyper than usual.”

                    “I just get hyped up when my little hero is doin’ something cool! You’re gonna be the coolest, impressive-ist person in town after this!”

                    “I hope so. Alright, maybe up here?” Violet climbed up a set of shelves, nestling between a set of boxes with a good view of the loading dock. “No one ever looks up, right?”

                    <em>Scene 26</em>
                    <em>July 2nd, 2028</em>

                    The truck did not show up in ten minutes, but thankfully it wasn’t much longer after that; she didn’t want to run into problems with time. A pair of workers opened the loading dock’s door and helped guide the semi into position, eventually opening its rear door as well to get at the contents inside. Namely, boxes upon boxes worth of bread and bread-adjacent foodstuffs (pastries, doughnuts, that sort of thing) from the chain’s own brands.

                    Her original plan had been to somehow steal an entire pallet of bread and feed it to ducks at the park. But it had been hampered by two major concerns. First: how to actually move the pallet. She didn’t have telekinesis or super strength and it was quite a way from here to there. She couldn’t exactly bring it on a bus. And second: it turned out after some research that bread actually wasn’t good for ducks and she didn’t want to mess them up that much, no matter how funny it would be.

                    So the plan had shifted. If not the ducks, what else could she do with a pallet of bread? And if it was too hard to move it on its own...

                    Violet noted the truck driver yawning as he walked into the store to compare paperwork with the workers there. The grin from before came back.

                    ... Well, it would sure be a lot easier to move if she didn’t take it out of the semi at all.

                    “Sleep mist,” she whispered, dispersing a cloud of the substance across the three visible workers. It worked very quickly on regular people, especially those who were clearly pretty tired already. Within moments, they were asleep on the floor.

                    Violet hopped down from her perch and scampered across the open area to reach the bubble, double checking to make sure her hood was up before crossing the faintly shimmering boundary. All good; she didn’t pass out. A huge bounty of high-carb food awaited her.

Vani, can you check the parking lot?”

                    “You got it!” Off she went. Violet pilfered a large, truck-looking key from the driver and casually hopped down from the loading dock to test it out. The door opened and the engine started. She now sat at the wheel of the largest vehicle she had ever attempted to drive, sitting way too low and way too far back in the seat. Where were the controls?

                    “Vi-o-let~!” Vani sang as she returned. “Someone’s coming~!”

                    “Hm?” She looked up from fiddling with the seat controls. “Who? Did they notice anything?”

                    “Some grumpy guy in dark blue. He’s got a guuunn~!”

                    “Blue? Like, a cop? You do know what cops look like; I know you do.”

                    “Dunno. I don’t think so, but he’s really maaad!”

                    “Ah, screw the seat then,” Violet decided. “Let’s just <em>go!</em>

                    Lillian had gotten her driver’s license somewhat recently and had a reasonable amount of experience driving normal, regular-sized cars. Violet, while primarily the same person, had very different opinions on traffic safety, reasonable speed limits, and (of course) stealing giant semi trucks from supermarkets. All that is to say that, while Violet understood how to operate the truck in principle, doing so in practice was an entirely different matter.

                    “Sure is nice that there aren’t any cars around!” Vani said over the wind as Violet clipped a stop sign and blew straight through two rows of parking spaces as well as the intersection the sign had marked.

                    “I can go <em>fast</em>,” Violet agreed, jostling over a dip in the road. “Which way to the lake? It’s left, right?”

                    “Did you say left or right?”

                    “I said left, right! Like, left!”

                    “That’s right!”

                    “So, left?”

                    “Right!”

                    She looked up at Vanity interrogatively. “Okay, enough of the slapstick act; I actually need to know which way to go.”

                    “Left! Yeehaw!”

After going probably a little too fast over probably a little too large of a bump, something very loud happened in the back. The mirrors weren’t adjusted properly for someone of Violet’s height, so it was initially difficult to see what had happened. But with some help from Vani, it quickly became obvious: the rear door had fallen open and a bunch of boxes had tumbled onto the main road.

                    Violet slowed the truck, intending to hop out and lock it properly this time (only now realizing she had forgotten to do that initially), when they encountered their second hurdle.

                    “It’s the fuzz!” Vani shouted maniacally, twirling in midair to indicate one of the rearmost-facing mirrors. Sure enough, red and blue lights flashed somewhere in the near distance. “Drive; driiiive!~”

                    <em>Scene 27</em>
                    Violet floored it, but that only dropped more stuff out the back and also made it way too risky to turn. She couldn’t keep that up without crashing the truck. So, a different idea came to mind. “Vani, take the wheel!” she shouted, rolling down the window to poke her head and arms out the side.

                    Wind whipped at her hair and Vani’s maniacal, unstable driving wasn’t making it any easier, but she could do it. The bubbles were large and her aim was good. Focus; get it exactly right, and...

                    “Sleep mist!” A translucent bubble sprang up in front of the line of cop cars, essentially invisible in the night. Some swerved or slowed, but they were still coming. Made sense; they were going fast and the cars would be blocking much of the mist anyway. But... “Sleep mist!” She could just... “Sleep mist!” Keep making more... “Sleep mist!” Until...

                    The lead car drifted too far right at the next intersection and glanced off a traffic light, spinning crazily to crash into a sturdy building just beyond. Several other cars met similar fates, tumbling over curbs or - in the most brutal of the crashes - missing a turn and slamming directly into a storefront. Flames spilled from the building. The remaining cars cut their losses and stopped pursuit. Probably their best option, given that it was certainly clear they were dealing with a villian of some description. Would they know who Violet was? Probably; she had caused trouble around here several times before. Never to this extreme, though.

                    The better question, however, was “what were they going to do about it?”

                    “Lemme take that back,” she said, sliding back into the driver’s seat as Vanity spun back towards the ceiling, cackling.

                    “Boom! Kapow! You got ‘em so good! So <em>evil!</em>”

                    “Good driving,” she commented. “Glad we didn’t end up like them.”

And, from somewhere far above, Violet began to hear what sounded like- “Is that a helicopter? Can you see it?”

                    Vani peeked out the still-open driver’s-side window. “Sure is! They’re so~ mad~!”

                    “You think I could get ‘em from heeere~?”

                    Vani laughed, swishing back to the wheel. “Try it! Try it!”

                    Violet leaned out the window again, squinting against the wind and glare. Her range wasn’t really that good, but the helicopter was flying somewhat low... “Sleep mist!”

                    No change in its flight pattern. She couldn’t even see the bubble in the dark to see how badly she had missed. Another few failed attempts solidified it; either she was out of range or just couldn’t aim well enough. Or they were wearing gas masks, or-

                    They were at the lake in another few minutes, leaving the bulk of the city behind as flames and emergency lights painted the bottom of a large cloud of smoke downtown. The truck rumbled over uneven roads; she slowed somewhat to avoid toppling over. Most of the boxes had fallen out by now. The helicopter still hovered somewhere overhead. “Ready for the finaaale?” she asked.

                    “What’s the finale?!”

                    To be honest, this part of the plan wasn’t very well thought-out. She had initially kinda intended to do a loop towards the main city - to the south - in order to ditch the truck somewhere so that other people could just take all the food that she couldn’t steal herself. But with the cops hot on her tail, that probably wasn’t much of an option at this point. Hence the detour to the lake. If she wanted to annoy this corporation as much as possible (which she did, hence why she almost exclusively targeted them), there was one good way to make sure of it.

                    “We’re GOIN’ IN!”

                    She drove the truck into the lake.

Violet dramatically underestimated the slowing power of slamming directly into a lake - and had inadvisedly taken off her seatbelt to sling mist at her pursuers - so she was immediately flung into the steering wheel hard enough to see stars. Water flooded the cabin through the open window; she spluttered and tried to get her bearings before plunging beneath the waves in only a matter of seconds.

                    Violet broke the surface a few moments later, gasping for air and still dazed from the hit to the head. But she tried to appreciate the spectacle anyway, treading water as the semi rapidly sunk, fountaining air from hidden compartments. “And th-that’s the... finale.” God damn, her head hurt.

                    Vanity was thrilled, though. “What a splash! Bread everywhere! The fish are gonna love it!” Similar compliments peppered the beleaguered villain as she swam back to shore - only to remember that she was still being tracked by a helicopter, now a very long way from the bus she intended to catch back home, and had just dumped her ride in the lake.

                    She may have gotten just a little bit carried away.

                    “Okay,” Violet decided, holding her forehead to try and think better. “First thing: lose the cops. Gotta... find somewhere to change back...”

                    She was standing on the eastern shore of the town’s lake, near the boat launch and marina. The town proper was directly in front of her, but she could already hear more approaching emergency sirens - presumably they were more confident now that she had sunk the truck. There were semi-mansions along the lakeshore; she could hide amongst the suburbia or try her luck in some of the small patches of trees nearby. Or, of course, dive back into the lake. Would that fool the helicopter?

                    <em>Scene 28</em>
                    The helicopter was the biggest problem right now and there was only one nearby option that offered anything akin to a roof. Violet hurried towards the long, narrow band of trees that separated the mansion zone from the town proper and slipped under the canopy. Great, now it probably couldn’t see her anymore. But if she just changed back and popped out, she’d probably be taken in for questioning even if they didn’t make the connection between her forms. And that would be really, really bad for really, really obvious (parent-related) reasons.

                    So she had to get fully clear of the area and not just rely on the anti-recognition enchantment. Okay; it was fairly dark here outside of the town proper, at least if she got away from the helicopter’s searchlight. And the line of trees stretched quite a distance to wrap around the lake. The beginnings of a plan began to take shape.

                    “Shadow mist,” she whispered a minute later, three times over. Three bubbles of darkness (more than she could have done at once even a week ago) appeared in three careful locations, each bridging different gaps between this band of trees and one of several buildings where she could theoretically hide from the helicopter under overhangs or similar. “Which one are you going to check?” she asked the sky as she jogged up the band.

                    Apparently, it decided to check all three of them in order. South to north, based on its position when she had started this. Which would have been a good idea... if she hadn’t quickly crossed in the open while it was otherwise occupied, relying on the night’s darkness to hide her and her own darkness to act as a distraction.

                    It started circling to try and pick her up, and at this point another set of cop cars had arrived at the crashed semi, but Violet was fairly fast and had fairly good endurance; she could run for a good while to get out of range. All it took was that one initial leap to give her a minute to do just that.

                    Now that she was downtown instead of on the outskirts near the box store, the time and direction the bus would arrive was obviously different; she only had fifteen minutes to get to the stop instead of 35. Still enough time, but not exactly “plenty.” Lillian had to walk quickly through the darkened streets, stopping just once to wring out her socks because it was really annoying to have them squishing with every step. Well, stopping twice, actually. Because-

                    Her route brought her close to the still-smoldering wreck she had caused with sleep mist. Fire engines worked to extinguish the building and car alike; Lillian had never been this close to an active emergency before. Vani popped into view somewhere overhead. “Hehe; like your han-di-wooork? Look at all the chaos!”

                    “...” She spotted a pair of discomfiting white sheets draped over a pair of uneasily human-looking forms. S-surely, she hadn’t... “Vani, do you think those are...”

                    Lillian trailed off, both because she was unwilling to finish the question (Vani didn’t seem to mind) and because she had spotted something concerning in a different way to look at. There was a girl with impractically long, impractically pink hair, wearing what was obviously some sort of frilly pink hero costume, talking with a cop. Lillian couldn’t hear anything they were saying from here - and certainly couldn’t get closer - but it was clear the hero wasn’t being interrogated. In another minute or so, she lifted gently into the air and shot upwards to leave behind a sparkly light trail.

                    “Hmmm, hmmm!” Vani rubbed her head, acting out the act of thinking. “I think that’s my lovely enemy Com-pass-ion~’s partner! What was her name...? Some sort of fruit, I think... Vi-o-let~, think of pink fruits for me. Maybe it’ll come baaaaack.~”

                    “Er...” Coming up with any pink fruits on the spot wasn’t easy. “Like, a... peach? That’s sort of pink?”

                    “No; that wasn’t it... More fruits!”

                    “Er; n-nevermind; that doesn’t matter. I can probably look it up later. But she can <em>fly?</em> And she’s probably looking for me. How can she fly?”

                    To be clear, flying heroes weren’t entirely unheard of, but the power was rare and often difficult to control. Usually, heroes with the power of flight would only be able to hover or glide at first, slowly gaining ability as they matured. To see someone who was seemingly even younger than Lillian able to rocket into the sky like it was nothing was certainly beyond rare. Likely not <em>unique</em>, but close enough.

                    “Compy’s really strong!” Vani answered. “She’s like, kapow! I bet she’s strong enough to make her partner fly!”

                    “Angels can just do that if they’re strong enough? Without having to go through all the training and development and such?”

                    “Demons toooo~! That’s why I bet your best buddy Silver’s gonna have some craaaaazy tricks soon. Mr Grumpy’s <em>super</em> strong.”

                    “She’s not my ‘buddy.’ And, wait, the way you said that - is Zeal a demon?”

                    “No, no. Just King Grump of the angels.~ I was just sayin’ there’re some demons that are <em>super</em> strong toooo.~ In fact, I think there’s one comin’ here soon!”

                    “Which one? When? How do you know that?”

                    A silly, upside-down wink. “It’s a secret!~”

No one paid her any mind, but it again meant she couldn’t talk to Vani without seeming insane.

                    Instead, she had plenty of time to worry about...

                    <em>Scene 29</em>
                    Well...

                    Violet was a fairly new hero of darkness. She had met Vanity less than a year ago and had agreed to the deal because she just needed <em>something</em> to do where she didn’t have to be the person her parents wanted her to be. Going out and stealing from the box store, or causing some minor property damage, or putting down blinding mist in inconvenient but funny places - that was the extent of it. Just some harmless (well, minimally harmful) antics to get it out of her system, you know?

                    But over time, things had escalated. Just a bit, but it hadn’t felt as cool or rewarding or generally fun to do the same little things every time. Vani encouraged her to think bigger. More exciting. To branch out.

                    Even so, tonight had been a pretty massive escalation. She hadn’t intended to steal the entire truck in her original plan, and even after deciding to do so at the last minute, she really hadn’t intended to get into a car chase. But once she had...

                    Well.

                    Even just in her thoughts, the question <em>“Did I actually kill someone?”</em> was too difficult to ask. The image of those two white-sheeted bodies was too uncomfortable to recall. So, instead, she rationalized.

                    She couldn’t have. Her sleep mist only made people drowsy, then put them to sleep. Obviously. She hadn’t used her poison mist, or even the shadow mist that could have blinded a driver and caused a crash. The cars had some level of airtightness, and they were going fast, so it would have been given in small doses. They would have had plenty of time to realize what was happening, slow down, and give up. It wasn’t her fault, even if anything had happened. Even if anything had happened, it had been because they just didn’t make the right decision. That’s all.

                    Thoughts like this occupied her mind on the ride, then walk, then slow, careful climb back up the stairs to her room. Where, finally, Lillian could fall into bed and utterly fail to sleep.

                    “...”

                    Hiding under her covers to conceal the lightshow, Lillian transformed back into Violet in order to cast the sleep mist on herself. Maybe it would work. Maybe she’d be able to just go to sleep. Oop, hood down first. Then, “Sleep mist,” she whispered, casting it just above her bed.

                    Within moments, she felt her eyelids getting heavy. Violet only barely had enough time to remember that maybe she should transform back in case anyone barged into her room, then do that, before she passed out entirely. It sure was a good thing that the mist bubbles only lasted a matter of minutes before dissipating, or she might never have woken up.

                    But it sure wasn’t such a good thing that the mist only helped her get to sleep, and not necessarily get a <em>good</em> sleep. Lillian’s dreams that night weren’t exactly pleasant.

                    ...
                    <em>July 4th, 2028</em>

                    “Yo, Silver, you made it.” Mahogany nodded to her, then at the person leaning against the wall nearby. “This’s Granite. Dude I was telling you about.”

                    “Hi; good to meet you.” There was an awkwardly formal handshake.

                    “So, what’s he been telling you?” Granite asked. “All my best heroic exploits, I assume?”

                    “...” Silver didn’t immediately answer, but her expression said enough.

                    “All my <em>worst</em> heroic exploits, I see.” He sighed good-naturedly. “Wouldn’t expect anything less from this goober. But don’t worry, he told me only good things about you.”

                    “Really?” She felt like she had to share at least <em>something</em> embarrassing about her own performance, given that Granite was of course completely correct. “He skipped the part where I had just been knocked out and was probably about to be eaten when we first met?”

                    “No, he must have left that part out.” He leaned just a bit closer, as if to exclude Mahogany from the conversation without actually lowering his voice. “This man is a very unreliable storyteller. Don’t trust a word he says about someone else.”
                    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1339060312950964256 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1339060312950964256><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, February 11, 2025 9:27 PM">9:27 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Oi! Stop dissing my good name!” Mahogany shouldered in. “I was just tryin’ to be nice about my new friend!”

                    “And not about your old friend?”

                    As the two of them half-argued, half-joked with each other, Silver took a moment to look over Granite’s outfit. He seemed about her age, with short sand-colored hair partially covered by a futuristic-looking visor/helmet sort of thing. His main theme color seemed to be tan, like an expensive countertop, which matched fairly well with his sort of park ranger-esque hero outfit. Really, she didn’t know how to describe it any better; aside from some obvious sci-fi touches here and there (such as the visor, some inlays on the vest, and circuit-looking designs on the pants) it seemed like he could be giving tours at a mountain or forest or something.

                    “Anyway, enough about that,” Mahogany waved the conversation away. “Let’s get goin’. Sil, you good to go?”

                    “I’m good. But I can’t be too long or my parents will get worried. I came here with them.”

                    “We can take breaks; no worries. Let’s give it, say, a good half-hour to start with and see what we find? Sound good, G; Sil?”

                    Two expressions of assent. Off they went.

Fireworks attracted people, people attracted dark spirits, and huge crowds of people attracted huge crowds of spirits. Huge crowds of dark spirits, then, drew heroes to fight them. There were almost certainly other heroes - and likely villains - mixed in with the crowd tonight for similar reasons, so these three heroes had decided to stick together in order to track down and destroy as much evil as they could find. Preferably before it ruined anyone’s night.

                    <em>Scene 30</em>
                    The festival was large, lively, and filled with enough distractions that even their group of three transformed heroes didn’t draw much attention. Beyond just the fireworks, the streets along the riverbank were closed to cars for the event and populated by many dozens of pop-up stands or performances of all kinds. Music overlapped from various instruments at conflicting tempos and volumes. The atmosphere wasn’t exactly harmonious, but it was still energizing.

                    “Hey, that reminds me,” said Mahogany as they followed a mostly-invisible Justice towards their first target. “I was trying to see if I could at least find the song that villain I told you about was playing, even if I couldn’t find <em>her</em>, but it didn’t work. As ya might expect.”

                    “Are you saying this band sounds somewhat familiar?”

                    He tilted his head, listening. “Maybe. S’pretty good either way. And their lead guitar’s pretty cute too.”

                    “Honestly,” Granite said, peering over the crowd to get a better view. “You’re quite tactless sometimes.”

                    “Huh? Why?”

                    “I don’t mind,” Silver reassured them. “As long as you’re not going to try anything weird with me.”

                    “Oh!” Mahogany figured it out. “Nah, all good. You’re cute, but not really my type of cute. Unless you’re secretly a badass guitarist?”

                    “... Nope.”

                    “Just hero pals, then. Like me ‘n Granite! You know, one time last summer, there was a limbo contest and-”

                    “I believe we’re here,” Granite hurriedly interrupted. “Justice?”

                    “Yes,” the angel affirmed, hovering about a story above their heads. “It appears to be a humanoid-type. Limited threat to any of you; low range.”

                    “Ha! How ‘bout you two show each other what you can do, then?” Mahogany suggested. “Since you’ve both seen my skills.”

                    Silver was a little nervous to be put on the spot like that, but Granite seemed to be fine with it, so she shrugged. “Okay. Er, before we go in, what <em>can</em> you do? Mahogany told me a little, but...”

Anything involving the ground. I’ll probably start with a few shockwaves or an eruption, depending on its position. And yourself?”

                    Mahogany hadn’t told Granite anything about Silver’s signature magic, of course, because she hadn’t developed it when they had last met. By now, however, she had. Sort of. “Reflection. I can bounce just about anything off my hands, if I hit it right.” A bit of an exaggeration, but she had to sound competent to these stronger, more experienced heroes.

                    “Interesting; there may be some synergies there. I’m quite good at throwing things, so if you’re quite good at reflecting them, we could seriously confuse an enemy. Although it may be simpler to just attack directly.”

                    “Maybe we’ll think about it later. For now, just go get it?”

                    “Sure.”

                    They entered the side street together, pushing past occasional pedestrians as Mahogany trailed a bit behind. Nothing was obvious for a while, until a rasping, slurping sound clued them in on a small, sinewy silhouette crouching inside a cardboard box that people had obviously been using as a makeshift trash can. It looked up with a rattling grunt.

                    “Eruption, then,” Granite decided, stamping his foot on the ground and causing a spire of earth to erupt directly beneath the cardboard box. The imp-like creature was thrown into the air, along with a shower of debris. An easy target as it slowly crested its trajectory and began to fall, screeching and flailing. “How’s your aim?”

                    Pretty average, actually, but Silver didn’t say that or even go for a ranged, unattuned bolt at all. She wanted to show off. So she hurried forward, reaching up as if to catch the plummeting monster. An empty cup bonked off her forearm but she didn’t care. “Pretty good,” she answered after a delay. Silver pulled back and punched the falling monster, connecting with a flash of silvery light. And the thing shot at least twenty feet into the air.

                    “Solid unattuned melee,” Granite complimented her.

That’s why-” She pulled back and punched it again, sending it clear past the roofs of buildings on both sides. “I can just keep sending it further up with every hit.” A third whack sent it tumbling up at an awkward angle, crashing into the left building’s brick wall at high speed. The creature smeared, its body stretching and tearing like soft clay, before falling apart into a scattering of dull, dark pellets like hail or particularly evil-looking marbles. A bunch of them bounced off her head and upper arms. “Er, ta-da!”

                    He nodded appreciatively. “Very impressive, particularly for such an early foray into signature magic. I did expect we would have synergy relating to throwing things, but admittedly I hadn’t expected <em>the enemy</em> to be the thrown thing.”

                    “Yo, Silver, you chuck that guy up a building?” Mahogany interrupted, arriving now that they had dealt with the creature. “What the heck; been hittin’ the gym?”

                    Well, she didn’t mind explaining her cool abilities twice.

                    The half-hour before meeting up with her parents again absolutely flew by. With Justice’s help and the sheer number of monsters lurking around the periphery of the festival, hardly more than a minute or two passed between quick, efficient exterminations. It was hard to consider them “battles,” really, given how weak most of the monsters were - at least, compared to three heroes. Silver certainly would have had some serious trouble on her own, but with Mahogany and Granite here, it was hardly a problem. It was even - dare she think it - a little fun. Chatting and enjoying the festive atmosphere between fights; destroying the monsters with little difficulty during them. The knowledge that she was helping people the whole time. Even Zeal didn’t seem particularly grouchy today.

                    Hum. She had clearly been killing these lesser monsters tonight, and it was hard to argue that wasn’t her intent. It didn’t <em>feel</em> cruel or mean or evil or really like she was intending anything more than the “to stop” verb she had made her default over the last weeks. But, well, the result was clearly death. The deaths of inhuman dark spirits in the process of feeding on - actively harming - real humans, of course.

                    “...”

                    Why did he have to say anything? And why was this “intent” thing still such a big deal to her? Now she couldn’t stop thinking about it!

                    But it turned out that “couldn’t” was a bit of an exaggeration; by the time she found a place to transform back and returned to the rendezvous point with her parents, Bria had mostly gotten over it. Again, the things were monsters. It wasn’t like she was killing people or innocent creatures. It was fine. Justifiable; heroic, even. Now she just had to check in quick to get back out there.

                    “Hey,” Bria’s dad greeted her as they finally found each other near the railing overlooking the river. “Having fun with your friends?”

                    “Yeah,” she admitted. “I’m gonna meet back up with them in a bit, if you guys don’t mind.”

                    “You don’t want to spend time with your parents? I’m hurt!” he asked jokingly.

                    “You know that’s not it. Tell him, mom.”

                    “I don’t know, Brianna. You’ve hardly been home all summer, even when you’re not at work! So busy with your friends or preparing for college! I’m going to have a hard time when you move out.”

                    “...” She fidgeted a little, feeling a bit guilty but still wanting to get back to hero-ing. “Okay, okay; I think the first show starts in just a few minutes. I’ll tell them I’ll be staying here for it.”

                    Mom nudged her. “Don’t let us stop you if you really want to go. But we’d appreciate it if you stayed.”

                    She stayed. The fireworks were pretty neat.

                    And at the end of the first show, when Bria had gotten her phone back out to figure out where Mahogany and Granite were going to meet her, she unexpectedly met someone new. A girl with long pink hair and in a fancy, frilly, ribbon-y white/pink/red outfit was working her way through the crowd, asking people about any monsters they had seen.

                    “Monsters?” Bria’s mom answered; Bria looked up from her phone, startled to notice this new hero. “I don’t think so. Surely there wouldn’t be any nearby, right?”

                    “Hopefully not, but that’s what I’m checking on. How ‘bout you?”

Obviously she had seen some monsters; she had <em>killed</em> several. But wouldn’t that be kind of suspicious? <em>But</em> she didn’t want to impede some other hero’s work, so... “Er, m-maybe? What kind of monster are you looking for?”

                    “Really? Finally! I’ve been - ugh, don’t get your hopes up. ‘Kay, it’s a big egg, I think. Or something like an egg. My angel-” She patted the air just above her shoulder as if petting an invisible parrot. “-says there’s something around here somewhere that’ll cause a huge problem if we don’t deal with it soon. But I kinda suck at tracking monsters, so we’re lookin’ for it the old fashioned way. So, you seen anything like an egg? Or any kinda eggy looking thing?”

                    “... No, no egg. I’ve seen, er-” She glanced back at her parents, trying to be careful. “Some little fanged guys? B-but, I think some other heroes were already taking care of them.”

                    “Ugh, that’s no - other heroes?” The frilly girl took an excited step forward, skirt swishing with the movement. “Where? What’d they look like? Are they already handling this so I can go home?”

                    “... You just want to go home?”

                    “Or, like, hang out here like a normal person, I guess. It’s so lame to be wandering around asking people about monsters or digging through alleys when I could be having fun! But Compy’s very persuasive and I was sorta here looking for that other villain anyway, so I’ll do it. Gotta save the day. Anyway - other heroes! What about ‘em?”

                    “W-well...” Bria made a quick decision. If there really was some huge problem that this very pink person was chasing down, they could probably help her. Or vice versa. So... “There’s three of them. H-have you heard of Mahogany, Granite, or S-Silver?”

                    “Oof, yep, ‘the Hog,’ hehe! Maybe if he’s on it, I can-” A pause; she glanced at her shoulder. “Ugghhh! Fiiine, I’ll go <em>talk</em> to him. If I can find those three.” Back to Bria. “Any idea where they might be at?”

Maybe they’ll still be there, or someone will have seen them?”

                    “Okay, thanks! I better hurry; stay safe!” The pink hero lifted into the air and quickly gained speed to the east, leaving behind a glittery trail as she flew.

                    Bria stared after her, kind of stunned at the demonstration of easy flight. “I should, uh, probably go meet my friends, then,” she said weakly. “Make sure they aren’t in any trouble if there are monsters around?”

                    “You’re staying right here where it’s safe!” Bria’s mom decided, shaking off her surprise at that whole exchange. “Have your friends come here instead; they’re nearby, right?”

                    “Well-” She quickly typed a message to Mahogany, briefly explaining where he should go and who he should expect to meet. “Er, sort of?”

                    “Aren’t you texting them right now?”

                    “Y-yes? Look, I really need to make sure they’re okay-”

                    “You always were like this, weren’t you? Never willing to take ‘no’ for an answer when it comes to helping people.” Mom sighed. “Alright, you can go. But I’ll come with you to make sure you’re safe.”

                    “Y - no, mom! What about your legs?”

                    “They got me here, didn’t they?”

                    “Don’t push yourself,” Bria’s dad interjected. “I can go with her; it could be a lot of fast walking.”

                    “... Alright. But be back soon, okay?”

                    “Well, Bria? You heard your mom; let’s go.”

                    Well, she probably couldn’t wiggle out of this one. Using her phone as reference, Bria led her dad east down the street, leaving her mom still sitting by the river. She had health problems that kept her from moving around a lot, or quickly, but didn’t let that stop her. At least, not often. Still, for things like this, dad often offered to take her place.

                    “Who are we looking for?” he asked as they pushed through the crowd. “Anyone distinctive?”

                    “...” <em>Two heroes in fancy, obvious costumes,</em> she did not say. Could she even describe their appearance outside of their hero outfits? That probably wouldn’t work, since they probably looked about the same in their base forms. “Two guys around my age. They’ll be watching for us and hopefully looking lost.”

                    “Do these gentlemen have names?”

                    “Ergh-” Bria wasn’t cut out for this secret stuff. She was already starting to reply with their hero names and had to change course midway through the first syllable. “M... M-ike and, um, G-Gary.” A brief wince; that hadn’t sounded convincing at all.

                    “Mm hm. You’re sure you’re good friends with these two? Took a second to remember their names.”

I’m meeting a lot of new friends this summer... It can be hard to remember who exactly I’m with?”

                    “... Well, as long as no one’s taking advantage of you. You are being careful, right? Always double check when you’re meeting new men.” He nodded, tapping his own chest as an example. “Can never be really sure with one of those guys.”

                    “It’s fine; no one’s being weird. You worry too much.” <em>Mahogany even said that much today; I’m not his type.</em> Which, to be honest, was probably a relief. She didn’t mind him as a friend, but... <em>Anyway, how do I get away from dad and transform without making a scene? He’s not going to let me out of sight to go searching, and if I just disappear in the crowd he’s going to freak out. C’mon; think!</em>

                    She didn’t come up with anything good. So, on to the backup plan. “I think I see them!” she called, then dove into a much denser crowd surrounding one of the music performances from earlier. Dad briefly lost sight of her in the shuffle, Bria changed direction abruptly to get out of an obvious location, and then she slipped into one of the aforementioned spooky alleyways to quickly transform - oop, nope, too many people. She hurried down that one too, found a more secluded corner in a weirdly-designed store’s facade, and texted her dad.

                    “Think I lost you in the crowd somewhere,” she typed. “Gonna go back to mom once I find them, see you there”

                    That should put him off the trail. Now then, time to be a hero. And time to hope that it didn’t take too long or she’d be in <em>real</em> big trouble when she got back.

                    It only took her another few minutes to work through the maze of backstreets to where Mahogany and Granite were waiting, but the pink hero had beaten her there by quite a lot. She raised a hand to the three of them. “Hey; finally made it!”

                    “Sup,” Mahogany greeted her casually. “That’s Silver. You two met before?”

I’m Strawberry, as you can tell.” She pointed at the brooch fastened just below her collarbone, which indeed resembled the very same fruit. Bria hadn’t noticed before; she had been a little preoccupied. “Nice to meetcha and all that; you know what’s going on?”

                    “There’s an egg, right? Mahogany told me,” she lied smoothly. “Some sort of big disaster if we don’t find it?”

                    “Right. Compy says we’ve only got like 15 minutes to figure it out, but I still can’t tell where it’s coming from! Hog’s got his super-hearing, but, y’know, it’s an egg.” Strawberry shrugged. “Eggs don’t make much noise.”

                    “That’s super unfair, by the way,” Mahogany commented from the back. “If it’s about to hatch, shouldn’t it be clickin’ or tappin’ or somethin’ like that? But <em>noooo</em> it’s all quiet.”

                    “And none of the angels appear to be able to sense it with any degree of precision,” Granite noted, peeking around Strawberry’s other side. “Only Compassion was able to detect it independently at all, and her detection radius encompasses essentially this entire district.”

                    “So, we’re screwed,” Strawberry summed up. “Pretty please tell me you’ve got some super cool trump card that’ll let us find it in like, a minute flat?”

                    “... Zeal?” she asked, glancing upwards.

                    Somewhat surprisingly, he was actually still here. “Hmmm,” he intoned, drifting serenely between the buildings. “Yes, there is a substantial gathering of dark spiritual energy nearby. Unfortunately, detection was never my primary area of expertise, even outside of heroes of darkness. All I can tell you is that the river seems to be uneasy.”

                    “He thinks the river’s... ‘uneasy,’” Silver relayed, emphasizing the wording. “Whatever that means. Zeal, what does that mean?”

                    He shrugged. “Perhaps it does not appreciate being used to gestate a new spirit. Perhaps it is unrelated.”

It’s also <em>huge</em> and we’ve only got like 10 minutes if we wanna kill the egg before it hatches.” A pause. “Which we do, btw. In case that wasn’t clear.”

                    “I’m happy to go for a swim!” Mahogany volunteered. “I can do flippers; I’m super fast!”

                    “And I can ‘fly’ underwater, so I’m fast too,” Strawberry reluctantly admitted. “It’s just <em>gross</em>.”

                    “But if we don’t know which section to search, it still seems unlikely even the two of you together could inspect the entire area.” Granite tapped the wall in thought. “Is there any way to get a better idea of where to look? Or do we just have to guess?”

                    They thought about it for a minute, but really, the answer seemed obvious. “Why did we all come to this festival in the first place?” Silver asked rhetorically. “Because it’s full of people and is a big draw for monsters, right? So, wouldn’t it make sense for the egg to be as close as possible to right here? We’re basically right on the river.”

                    “You thinkin’ I should just jump off the edge and take a swim?” Mahogany asked, seeming excited about the prospect. “And if I find an egg, crack it up right good, yeah?”

                    “If you’re going to search somewhere, ‘right here’ does make some sense,” Granite began, nodding with a bit more vigor as he decided he actually did agree. “Sure, go right ahead. Call me if you find-”

                    “I’m on it!” he shouted, dashing towards the water.

                    “Now, since we do have a second hero who can search, we should send you off to a second location in case this guess is incorrect,” Granite continued, unphased by Mahogany’s sudden departure. “If we’re thinking about maximum potential damage...”

                    “There are a lot of big bridges around here,” Silver noted nervously. “If something big enough could break one...?”

                    “True, but how big would it have to be to reach all the way up from the river? Wouldn’t that be a little extreme?”

                    “I don’t know how big ‘something big’ will be!”

                    “Isn’t there a ferry terminal just a bit upstream?” Strawberry wondered, materializing her phone to check. “Yeah, right here! I bet it could knock some boats over; that’d be a super big mess!”

                    “Excellent,” Granite decided. “Off you go, then.”

                    “... But it’s so grooosssss.”

                    “Don’t people kayak and fish in the river? It can’t be <em>that</em> gross,” Silver tried to reassure her.

                    “Oh, it’s gross. You haven’t had to get river smell out of your hair. If you wanna go swimming with me, you’re welcome to come too and find out!”

                    “Er, that’s okay...” She shifted back slightly to avoid the proffered hand. “I’d probably just slow you down...”

I’ll call you if - waiiit I don’t have your number. Either of you. C’mon, quick!”

                    Silver hesitated a few seconds as Granite de-transformed his phone. She had done this before, but never in a real high-stakes situation. It had been a while since she had accidentally transformed back all the way (i.e. a day or two) while practicing partial transformations, but you never knew...

                    “Phone please!”

                    “...” Half-closing her eyes as if that would do anything if it went wrong, Silver put a finger on her hairclip and willed her phone back to her hand. A glow of transformation light, a soft sensation of weight, and... it was fine. She quickly swapped info with Strawberry and the pink hero rocketed into the night sky.

                    Granite watched her go for a few moments. “I know I shouldn’t complain, but seeing a power like that sparks a little jealousy. I wonder if I could catapult myself...”

                    Silver wasn’t listening. “Oh, dad’s - ah, mom too. Er, I should probably...” She fiddled with her phone, trying to come up with an excuse for why she hadn’t returned yet. “sorry, still looking I’ll be back asap” would have to do for now. Not much of an excuse, but it would at least tell them she was still alive and hadn’t been kidnapped or eaten by a monster.

                    Hopefully those assurances wouldn’t change in the next fifteen minutes or so.

                    “We should get to the river,” Granite reminded her. “So we can react quickly if the egg is allowed to hatch.”

                    “Right.” Silver transformed her phone away again (this hero outfit was flashy, but didn’t have any pockets) and jogged with him in the same direction Mahogany had sprinted. “Do you have any idea what the ‘something big’ will be? If we do have to fight it?”

                    “Afraid not. I’ve seen my fair share of large monsters, but if a hero like Strawberry is worried about it - especially with all three of us here as well - it’ll be something beyond the norm.”

                    “I think she’s more active in the northwest, near the airport. Uses her flight powers to stop aerial monsters that try to attack airplanes, so she’s very popular around there. She’s quite powerful for someone so young.”

                    “Oh good, I wasn’t the only one to think that,” Silver exhaled in relief. “I mean, her outfit definitely doesn’t make her look any older, but she can’t be more than like, a freshman in high school.”

                    “I’m not sure; I think she’s mentioned driving before, so she must be at least 16.”

                    “Really? I - I guess that makes sense; she must have been a hero for at least a few years to get such strong powers, so-”

                    “Her first public appearance was in November of last year,” Granite said with a smirk. “She’s only been doing this for about six months.”

                    “...”

                    He laughed. “Think about how it makes <em>me</em> feel! And Mahogany too; he got his powers in...” A moment’s pause to count it up. “Must have been three Decembers ago? 2025? And he can still only glide with his wings, for the most part.”

                    “Strawberry can’t be invincibly good, though,” Silver protested. “So she can fly; that’s not <em>that</em> impressive. What else can she do? I need to know for, er, team-up purposes.”

                    “Sure. You know unattuned magic?” Silver nodded. “She can do that, but with more power and flexibility. Energy beams, shields, nets, bubbles, that sort of thing. Like, in those old cartoons where you’d have barriers of magic force between old guys in pointy hats duking it out. That’s her signature magic.”

                    “That sounds pretty cool...” she admitted softly.

                    “Haha; don’t worry, she’s not invincible. Strawberry’s lost a few fights too. Her main thing is that she can fly so much better than just about any other hero except the height-of-their-career adults with similar powers. Without that, she’s really not as impressive as you’d think.”

                    <em>Scene 34</em>
                    “Huh. You sure seem to know a lot about Strawberry for someone who’s apparently never met her before,” Silver mused.

                    “You think so? I try to keep tabs on most of the local heroes I might end up working with, and there’s a lot of public information available. I just like being informed.”

                    “I guess that makes sense,” she said, not entirely sure if it did. Maybe? “Anyway, shouldn’t we get down to the water so we can help Mahogany quickly if he needs it?”

                    “Sure. There have to be some stairs around here somewhere...”

                    It took a few minutes to locate the poorly-signed entrance in the dim lighting, especially with more crowds gathering for the second fireworks show. Thankfully, that meant there weren’t as many people down at the actual river level - you couldn’t see as well from down there - but it was still busy enough to be noticed. In fact, they may have actually been more obvious down here, since there was less activity to hide their outfits.

                    So people asked what was going on. Was there something to be concerned about? It was a reasonable question, with two obviously-in-a-hurry heroes pushing past.

                    “We’re investigating a possible disturbance,” Granite vaguely explained. “I would recommend going back above if possible, in case we find anything.”

                    A few people listened; a few people didn’t. Some weren’t even paying attention or didn’t notice their presence. Before long, though, someone else noticed.

                    “Pffwah!” Mahogany burst out of the river a few feet in front of them, clambering onto the path like a drenched dog. “Hey guys! Fancy meetin’ you here.”

                    Silver tried to ignore the distressingly blood-red slits that had grown in his neck, probably acting as gills. “Did you find anything? I don’t know how long we have.”

I was about to call you, but funny thing! Turns out phones don’t like gettin’ wet!” He shook some water out of his hair, only furthering the dog comparison, and summoned his phone into his now merely-damp hand. “Biiiiig eggy lookin’ thing right down there,” he said, pointing. “Tried to break it, but it ain’t budgin’. So I’m gonna call Strawb and see if she can get it. Hey, what’s her number again?”

                    “You left before we - okay, it’s...” Granite started to read it off his phone as Silver peered into the water. Zeal was swooping around a strangely persistent set of ripples.

                    “What’s that?” she asked, unable to make anything out below the surface. “Is it doing something?”

                    “Hatching, I believe,” he commented dryly. “<em>Someone</em> seems to have cracked it slightly; enough to get its attention. It seems it would be wise to prepare for battle.”

                    “It’s not gettin’ through,” Mahogany said, somehow amused. “Just a ‘voicemail full’ sorta line. You think her phone’s off cause she’s still in the river? Boy, we really coulda planned this better.”

                    “Um, guys, Zeal says it’s hatching. You see those ripples?”

                    “Huh? Those? No, that’s just from when I... hmmm... actually, maybe you’re right.” A pause; the ripples grew stronger, churning into true waves. “Yeah, that ain’t my doing. Alright, how we gonna fight this thing?”

                    “We don’t even know what it <em>is</em> yet!”

                    “That’s okay; we’re about to find out!”

                    ...

                    Strawberry sped through the murky water, hair streaming behind her and turbulent bubbles clouding her vision. Pink light poured from her hands and feet as she “flew,” illuminating her surroundings, but it was still really hard to see more than a few feet in any direction. Why had she even said anything? Hog loved swimming; she could have just let him do it!

Unlike some heroes, she couldn’t actually breathe underwater; just move quickly with her flight. So she had to be careful to not accidentally drown while down there.

                    “Strawberry!” Compassion tugged at her hair to get her attention. “Look, over there!”

                    She wiped water off her face to look in the direction indicated. “What is it? I don’t - holy cow!”

                    Strawberry leapt upwards, jetting into the air a few seconds before a massive wave passed by where she had just been. It inundated the docks and lower paths along the river, but wouldn’t have caused her any serious problems beyond just being tossed around a bit. No, she was more interested in the building-sized creature rising from the river a few blocks away.

                    Water and muck sluiced from its slick, eel-like form as it pulled itself out of the water, sluggishly rising into the air as more and more gross, finned portions of its body emerged. Occasional slimy yellow eyes dotted the monster’s flanks, staring wildly at everything in sight. The monstrosity finally rose fully from the water, body still dripping buckets of water onto onlookers below, and howled with a voice like a foghorn. Deep, powerful, and with enough vibration to feel it throughout her whole body.

                    “What is <em>that?</em>” Strawberry exclaimed without really expecting an answer. “Aside from stupid-ugly, that is.”

                    “It looks like an eel.”

                    “With more eyes than I’m used to! God, why can it fly?! I’m gonna have to fight it basically alone now! Ugh, this is <em>so</em> not my day.”

                    “I bet your friends can still help you! Look, it’s flying really low, like it’s about to - uh oh.”

It slid along one of the two riverside festival streets, sending up a huge cloud of dust as stands, walls, and pavement were all pulverized in the face of its sheer scale.

                    “How many people did it just eat?” she wondered, almost stunned. “We - we gotta <em>move!”</em>

                    But as she shot forward, essentially blow-drying herself from the speed, there was a loud, obvious... guitar riff? The eel lurched, shifting back into the sky and raining debris. And from somewhere on the ground, a small person-shaped speck launched itself into the air on a blast of sound.

                    “Compy, who’s-”

                    “Not a hero of light,” she determined quickly. “This is Havoc’s partner. Be very careful; your flight is a bad match-up against her sonic abilities.”

                    “But if she’s attacking the eel too...?”

                    Compassion’s mood shifted in an instant. “Team-up time?”

                    “To be honest, I’m gonna need all the help I can get.”

                    <em>Scene 35</em>
                    The eel banked up and right as Strawberry approached, doing a slow, lazy turn across the river and giving her time to set down and assess the situation. The street was a bit of a (lot of a) mess, with large strips of broken concrete and a cloud of dust obscuring most of the damage. No one was obviously torn in half or dying, though she didn’t have <em>much</em> time to assess. Instead, she shifted a slab of pavement off someone’s leg before spotting who she was actually looking for crashing back down from the sky to land in a ripple of pressure and a brief chord.

                    “Lapis; hiiii!” she called, waving as she jogged over. “It’s me again!”

                    The older hero turned. “Oh god, not you too. I just saw some other idiot down by the water; how many of you are there tonight?”

                    “At least four!” Strawberry sidled a little closer, keeping one eye on the sky as the eel swirled back towards them. “You’re fighting it too? Don’t monsters usually not attack darkness people like you?”

                    “Not this one. Had to transform right in front of everyone to - hell, why do you care? Go fly up there on your pretty princess ribbons and get rid of it! Don’t waste your time trying to start something with me!”

                    “I’m not trying to start anything...” she exclaimed, bouncing another step closer. “Except maybe a team-up!” A proffered hand, an innocent smile as if they hadn’t tried to kill each other just a few weeks ago. “I could really use your help, if you’ll give it.”

                    “And why should I trust you?”

                    “Cause we’ve got the same goal! I want that thing gone and so do you, so let’s take it down together and-”

                    “I could just let it eat you. That’d save me a hell of a lot of trouble later.”

                    Strawberry gasped dramatically, covering her mouth with a hand. “How rude! C’mon, if it kills me you’ll have to fight it yourself and that’ll be super tough and lame for you!”

                    “I could just get out of its way.”

Even you’ve got someone you want to protect, I bet. Or else you wouldn’t have transformed right in front of everyone to-” She cut herself off as Lapis had done just a minute earlier. “Just once! You can go back to being evil right after we-”

                    “Fuck’s <em>sake</em>, fine!” She quickly grabbed Strawberry’s proffered hand and shook it once, then took a few steps back to get back into a playing position. “Got a plan, then? Cause if I blast off from here, you’re going flying, and not the kind of flying you like.”

                    “Course I do!” she beamed. “I’ve thought about our team-up attacks a lot-”

                    “You have? Why?”

                    “-and you don’t have to waste your magic on flying! I gotcha covered!”

                    “Hold on, you can’t possibly lift - WAIT JUST A-”

                    With a tight one-armed hug and a net of pink energy extending from one hand, she could and did. Strawberry blasted off with Lapis in tow, secure but with both arms free to play. Similarly, Strawberry herself retained her other hand for utility use, which was immediately proven wise as the eel noticed them coming. Several of its auxiliary eyes swiveled in their direction, several colored rings around the pupil illuminating in turn.

                    “Hang on tight! Evasive maneuvers!” Bolts of laser-like yellow light flashed out of the eyes at rhythmic intervals, but Strawberry managed to either dodge or deflect the initial barrage with a combination of agile flying and an energy shield deployed from her free hand. Then, with a short pause as they arced over the eel’s back, “Now, get it right in the eyes!”

                    “Shoulda let the eel eat you,” Lapis muttered, but coordinated anyway. A deafening blast of sound combined with a flare of pink light, sending the eel squirming sideways as one of its eyes popped with a squelching burst of thick ochre slime... and also sending the pair of supers shooting further into the sky.

                    “Is that REALLY your top priority right now?!”

                    “Nope! Let’s do it again!”

                    ...

                    “G, gimme some height,” Mahogany requested as the eel spiraled back towards the festival. “Right when it’s about to pass over us!”

                    “There’s no way I can get you <em>that</em> high,” he replied, eyeing up the distance. “It has to be at least a few hundred feet up.”

                    He spun in place, thinking. “Well, how am I supposed to get up there if Strawb’s not pickin’ up? It’d take way too long to climb one of these buildings and glide over.”

                    Only a few moments passed. “What about Silver? She just bounced a little monster up thirty feet without much effort; perhaps if we combine our abilities-”

                    “Say no more; I’m in! Sil, do your thing!”

                    “Er- I can only reflect things I can touch, so-”

                    “Hand up.” Confused, she raised her hand. He high-fived it. “Bam. Touched.”

                    “N-no, I mean when you’re going up, I’d need to touch you right when you’re going fastest, and with air resistance I don’t think you’d actually be gaining much speed just from my punch.”

                    “Oh, I getcha. But don’t worry, you won’t be punchin’ me. G, you get what I’m sayin’?”

                    “I believe so. Silver, please stand back two steps. Good. Now, get ready!”

                    A massive column of stone erupted from the pavement beneath Mahogany, shooting him up a good distance - but not nearly far enough to reach the eel.

                    “Now, forward!” Granite motioned to Silver as the column sank back down to leave only a patch of churned dirt and rock. “Into the column!”

                    She figured it out. “You’re gonna <em>launch</em> me into him?!”

                    “Good luck!”

Thankfully (for it would have been very painful for both if she had failed), Silver managed to tag him in the chest with her hand, instantly reversing both their momentums. Mahogany shot back up with roughly twice the speed, while Silver slammed into the ground as if she had fallen from a much higher distance.

                    “Oooo-” Granite winced. “May have forgotten one part of the - oh, you’re - <em>is</em> this going to work, actually?”

                    She bounced off the ground and shot back up, reflecting her momentum again to rise a good distance into the air before falling back down. “I hate this plan!” she shouted as she plummeted a second time.

                    “I’m going to bounce you again!” he yelled, watching Mahogany’s trajectory crest and begin to angle downwards. “Two more should do it!”

                    Another column flung Silver into the air with a burst of reflected speed, and another well-coordinated collision sent Mahogany blasting into the sky, easily more than halfway to the eel’s current height. Of course, Silver was now falling with even more speed than before and bounced up even higher on her reflected return trip. She shouted something else at Granite as she went, but with all the noise he couldn’t hear.

                    “Goodness, this is quite a spectacle,” he murmured, preparing the column for one more go. “Ready? Last one!”

                    “-THE WORST!” he managed to make out as she rebounded off the rising column for a third time, this time almost missing Mahogany and sending them both rocketing off at weird angles. Conveniently (did he do that on purpose?), Mahogany shot diagonally towards the eel at incredible speed, which of course left Silver screaming towards the ground at an angle where Granite couldn’t possibly catch her. Or, well, he probably wouldn’t have been able to anyway; rock doesn’t exactly act as excellent cushioning for a great fall.

                    <em>Scene 36</em>
                    He couldn’t do much more than watch her bounce off the street on the opposite side of the river, then ricochet off a skyscraper and arc right back towards the eel - in roughly the same direction as Mahogany’s launch. He couldn’t see Hog from here, given that he didn’t glow and was probably on the eel somewhere anyway, but he could certainly make out a tangle of pink streamers that indicated Strawberry had made it over there at some point. Silver would certainly have her hands full as she shot into that mess.

                    Granite stood there a moment more, hands on hips as he considered his handiwork. “Ah, everyone seems to have left me behind,” he realized. Now occupied with a roster of airborne heroes, the eel didn’t seem particularly interested in coming back down where he could hit it. Maybe if he got a little higher, though?

                    Another column of rock burst through the pavement and Granite launched himself back up to the main street level. He gauged the distance, considered just how far he could raise the ground, and... “Nope, not a chance. Good luck, everyone. Suppose I’ll help out down here.”

                    There was certainly plenty to do; the street was swamped in debris and who knew how many people were trapped just out of sight? With another glance towards the sky, Granite rolled up his metaphorical sleeves (his hero outfit didn’t come with any) and got to work.

                    ...

                    Silver reached the top of her arc and began to fall. Somehow, she was <em>above</em> the eel now, despite several reflections and many seconds of bleeding speed to the air. Somewhere to the left, Strawberry and the guitar-playing villain Mahogany was obsessed with were doing an admirable job of keeping its attention while making occasional targeted attacks against its eyes. Somewhere nearby (though impossible to tell where in the chaotic dark), Mahogany was presumably about ready to start tearing it up. And somewhere just below, the eel’s slick, smooth flank writhed as it fought its attackers.

But she had never done so many reflections in a row before, let alone of <em>herself</em>, and her magic was seriously waning. It wouldn’t be a guarantee she’d have enough power left to safely bounce to a stop if she fell.

                    “Honestly, what were they <em>thinking?</em>” she half-muttered, inaudible even to herself past all the rushing wind. “Not even telling me first?” It had worked - somehow - but she hadn’t been ready for the plan at <em>all.</em> It had taken all her concentration to avoid slamming into the pavement hard enough to probably turn to jam. How durable was her battle form, really? Enough to survive the first few bounces? Maybe. Enough to survive a drop from a thousand feet up? Maybe not.

                    Questions for later. Right now, Silver had an eel to catch. Unfortunately, she didn’t have any sort of power that would help her <em>stay on</em> - she had thought of the idea to reflect only half her momentum, thus cancelling it entirely, but come on. She had only gotten the basic thing working like last week. And bouncing wholly off it from here would probably be enough to send her all the way down. So...

                    Somehow, Silver crashed into the eel about a third of the way down its body, tumbling uncontrollably along its slick, sticky back until she smooshed into something softer and finally came to a stop.

                    “Uuugghhhh...” She struggled to get up, alternating between slipping and sticking and not really sure what she had hit. Until she managed to turn partially around and see her elbows jammed up against an enormous yellow eye, distorting the goopy covering and preventing its thick, milky inner eyelid from closing to get her out. One foot was jammed under the outer lid and she couldn’t get it unstuck with the thing trying to close and only pressing her in more. “GAH-”

                    Embers of yellow light drifted in the air; Silver fell back against its skin, stunned. Fiery pain throbbed in her back where the laser had hit, but at least she was alive and out of the eye so it couldn’t do that aga - REALLY?

                    Silver screamed with effort as she tugged at her leg, somehow still stuck under the eel’s eyelid and now being crushed between them as it tried to blink her out. Heat bloomed beneath her foot as it charged a second laser, but now that she was lying down in the other direction, it couldn’t get an angle to hit her. Bolts of light flashed into the sky, doing no damage beyond heating her lower leg to an increasingly painful temperature. It was <em>really</em> stuck; she just couldn’t pull it out no matter what she tried! If the eel would just <em>STOP BLINKING</em> for a few moments maybe she could get a better grip, but- “AAAAAAAUGH!” she yelled, then half-collapsed into something resembling laughter as the situation’s sheer absurdity almost overwhelmed her.

                    <em>“How’d you die?”</em> an imaginary ghost asked her.

                    <em>“My leg was stuck inside a giant eel’s eyeball and it microwaved me with its laser eyes,”</em> the deceased imaginary-Silver responded, deadpan. Alive real-Silver thought that was very funny in the moment, though she certainly wouldn’t at any other time. <em>“Seriously, I’m not making this up. How would YOU have gotten out of it, smart guy?”</em> she asked the disbelieving imaginary ghost.

                    <em>“Well,”</em> it began.

                    <em>Scene 37</em>
                    <em>“Given that I would have the ability to reflect any projectile if I were you, I simply would have had the eel microwave its own eye with its own laser.”</em>

                    Silver snapped out of it, suddenly remembering that she wasn’t dead, the ghost didn’t exist, and she had just thought of something. It seemed obvious in hindsight, but she could make any number of excuses. She didn’t know if the laser was too strong to reflect. She might run fully out of magic and splat when she hit the ground. The reflected beam might fry her leg too. But really, she had just kinda forgotten. And it made too much sense not to try.

                    “Let’s see how you like a taste of your own medicine,” she murmured, still a little out of it from... everything. A lean back over, a confidently spread hand right over the eel’s stupid laser-shooting pupil. A series of lights pulsing towards the iris, a burst of heat and light, a flare of reflective power.

                    Silver shot the eel. Or the eel shot itself, depending on your perspective.

                    There was an immediate scent of burning eyeball and a sickly inner goo began to ooze out from a ragged, cauterized tear. The eye deflated enough to finally release some pressure on her leg and let Silver - at last - pull herself free. “Yes!” she exclaimed, sliding along the eel’s back, before very quickly remembering that she now didn’t have any obvious way to stay on the creature as it began a full-on loop-de-loop.

                    “No!” she revised, scrambling for purchase but coming up with only handfuls of slime. A blast of sound sent the eel whipping quickly in the other direction and almost twisting fully around itself, finally dislodging Silver entirely and sending her spinning into open air.

                    Mustering the last remains of her magic and without any other options, Silver bounced off the pavement with a burst of light, spinning back up and desperately hoping that air resistance would slow her down to a nonfatal speed before she completely ran out of power.

How much did she have left? It was hard to tell beyond a sense of overwhelming exhaustion.

                    Bounce. Was there anything else she could do? Land on top of a building, maybe? Could she angle just right to hit one?

                    Bounce. Surely, <em>surely</em> she could come down on the roof over there. If she just managed to fall a few feet in that direction...

                    Crash.

                    Bria lay on the roof for a few moments, catching her breath and marveling at how alive she was. Her battle form had burst apart on the last hit, which hadn’t been a reflection at all since she apparently had run clean out of magic. That left her exhausted, beat up, untransformed, and stranded atop a random building, but it was certainly better than most alternatives she could imagine. Her back throbbed and her leg burned. They’d probably be fine. At least she’d managed to do <em>something</em> against the giant monster; she had actually blown up one of its eyes. It was more than she had expected, to be honest.

                    “...”

                    She sat up, watching more bursts of pink sound explode against the eel as it twisted unnaturally from some other invisible force. Mahogany, presumably, carving it up like a chef. They were doing fine; it hadn’t come back down even once past its initial attack. Despite its massive size, it actually hadn’t been <em>that</em> threatening. A few blocks of destroyed street; maybe some varied injuries from that. For as worried as everyone had been, it certainly could have gone much worse if they hadn’t all been together.

                    “...”

                    How could she get down from here? Was there a staircase or...? Oh, she could probably ask Strawberry to fly her down, once she recovered enough to transform again. Maybe she’d just get her phone out now to-

Only a couple dozen missed texts and calls from her parents. That made sense. In all the chaos, they would definitely be worried. She should probably tell them she wasn’t dead. “Still alive,” she typed, then deleted. Was that too flippant? “I’m okay” - was she really? Bria locked her phone, then unlocked it a second later. She had to say <em>something!</em>

                    A horrifyingly loud sound, like that of a foghorn taking the job of a tornado siren, distracted her. Bria covered her ears, looking up just in time to watch the eel fall towards the river in slow motion, burning with pink flames from its open mouth. Yellow liquid streamed from a number of destroyed eyes along its flanks. And in just a few more moments, it crashed into the waves, fountaining water well over the banks in an umbrella-like spray. It was dead. They had done it.

                    Which meant it was <em>definitely</em> time to send that text already. “I’m okay but stuck somewhere,” she wrote, trying very hard to not overanalyze it. “I’ll find you once I get out.”

                    That would have to be enough. And it was fairly true - she certainly didn’t feel like risking a fall from here and the only entrance to the building was locked with a hefty padlock. So, after recovering enough energy to feel like she could manage a transformation again, she hesitantly tried to get ahold of the only hero nearby who could easily come get her.

                    “Okay, I’m just gonna set you down here,” Strawberry said, gently touching down near the waterfront. “You hang out with the guys while I go pick up someone else, k?”

                    “Not a chance,” Lapis replied, wriggling out of the energy net within which she had spent the last many minutes. “I gotta go check on-” A pause. “-the street,” she decided.

                    “Great! They’ll help you check!”

                    Granite was already nearby and did a polite little wave. “I could certainly use some help here. Assuming you aren’t going to try to fight me again.”

                    Lapis seemed to figure out who he was. “This guy too? Unbelievable. You’re not gonna tell me I know your fourth hero too, right?”

                    “I don’t think so?” Strawberry lifted into the air, drifting to the south. “I only met her tonight. Silver, I think.”

                    “Good. Get outta here. And I’m not helping you,” she informed Granite.

                    “There are wounded civilians here,” he tried. “Can’t you put aside your-”

                    “Get <em>going,</em> pink,” she growled, seemingly ignoring Granite in favor of snapping a rush of air at Strawberry that sent her twirling further up. “‘Fore this guy’s friend shows up.”

                    “He’s by the water!” she called faintly, drifting away backwards. “Getting rid of the eel!”

                    “I don’t care! Leave!”

                    Strawberry left. But then she turned around and peeked out from behind a rooftop to grin widely. Lapis was helping, using her sonic powers to break apart a massive chunk of rubble so Granite could move it more easily. She just didn’t want to look friendly, but of course she was a softie inside! Strawberry did a little somersault in midair at her conclusion, finally darting off to actually go get Silver. Which building had she said, again?

                    “Compy?~” she called in midair. “You think Lapis is actually nice?”

                    The angel materialized from light, drifting serenely despite keeping up with Strawberry’s terrific speed. “I can’t say that; I can only comment on her partner.”

                    “Boo,” she pouted. “Kay, how ‘bout Havoc? That’s who you said earlier, right?”

                    “Malice? Who’s the partner there?”

                    Compassion shrugged. “Maybe no one. The very powerful, very ancient demons have a habit of pushing their partners too far. I suppose the powerful angels can be guilty of that, too.”

                    “That’s right; you <em>should</em> feel guilty for making me do all this work!” Strawberry declared. “I haven’t had a night off all week!”

                    “It’s Tuesday.”

                    “And I was busy hero-ing yesterday too! And the night before, of course. But that was a little different.”

                    Compassion sighed; they had this conversation a lot. Still, Strawberry never quit, even though she could. “I was referring more to those of the highest echelon, such as Zeal or Purity.”

                    “Silver’s, I think, but...” Strawberry thought about it a moment. “You keep talkin’ about angels I don’t know! Who’s Purity’s partner?”

                    “Who can say?”

                    “You can!” She shook her head. “You guys really drive me up the wall sometimes, you know that? So pointlessly mysterious.”

                    “It’s part of the full hero experience. You wouldn’t want to miss out, would you?”

                    “...” A pause; a side-eye. “As long as you don’t try and sell me on ‘the whole hero experience’ being, like, death and pain and staying up all night and that kinda thing.”

                    “Which I haven’t.”

                    “And that’s why we still get along! Hey, I think that’s her. Hold on, gotta slow down.” Strawberry dropped onto the roof, taking a few quick steps forward to dissipate the last of her momentum. “Oh, Silver! Your chauffeur has arrived!”

                    She climbed around an awkward tangle of pipes or chimneys or something to make her way over. “H-hi. Er, thanks for picking me up. I could maybe jump off and bounce, but...” Silver glanced over the edge; Strawberry joined her to look aaaaaalllll the way down. “... Not keen on risking it right now.”

                    “You can bounce?” she asked. “Like, with your reflections?”

                    “You were up there too? Geez; I didn’t see you at all! We didn’t shoot you by mistake or anything, right? How’d you get all the way down... you fell off and <em>bounced</em> over here?”

                    “Yep.”

                    “... Wow. We’re like half a mile from the river. I gotta see that in action later.”

                    “Maybe once I learn how to <em>stop</em> too...”

                    A little giggle. “Might be important. Okay, ready to get goin’?”

                    “Yeah. How does this work? Should I, er, climb on your back, or-”

                    A less-little giggle. “Ooh, piggyback might be fun! Usually I’d just carry you in a net like this-” She demonstrated, briefly. “-but maybe I can maneuver better with both hands free. Yeah, let’s do it!”

                    “M-maybe we should try the way you’re already familiar with?”

                    “Naw; you’ve got good grip strength, right? Held onto that eel for a while, I guess. Come on, up you get!”

                    Nervously, and with a brief protest that she <em>had</em> fallen off the eel, after all, she climbed up. Strawberry fell down. “Oh gosh; I’m so sorry - are you okay?”

                    “All good,” she said, rolling over. “I think I just forgot that I’m actually not very strong, even transformed like this. The net helps with the weight, I think.” She got up with Silver’s help, brushing off her skirt. “I’ll work on it. But for now, maybe you’re right with the net.”

                    They flew slower on the way back, as Strawberry wanted to get a better view of the damage. “Man,” she said, drifting over the tail end of the street the eel had chewed up. “Glad I happened to be around to help with all this. Didja know, I was actually only here ‘cause I was looking for another villain? Not the one I actually found, btw.”

                    “Really?” Silver asked. “Do you fight a lot of villains?”

Figured this festival might be a draw for someone like that, and it’s real close to her last crime. But nope, found someone else instead.” A pause. “You okay? You’re kinda pulling on the net.”

                    “Yeah, we’ve met. Once. She temporarily blinded a train driver and tried to make me fight her. But - but I don’t think she would have done something like - like actually <em>really</em> hurting anyone!”

                    “Why d’you say that? If you only met her once-”

                    “It just wasn’t like that! She didn’t - er, you know intent, right?”

                    “Yeah?”

                    “She didn’t have killing intent. Not when fighting me; not when doing anything to the train. She has, like, poison mist clouds and stuff, but didn’t use them on any civilians. And even with me, I think she just kinda let me go when I was stuck in a cloud? It just - I think there must have been some mistake.”

                    “I dunno; it was pretty brutal. I wasn’t there when it happened, but apparently she put a few cops to sleep while they were driving after her. One of them crashed into a building. There was a spark, the gas tank blew up, the fire department had to show up - it was a whole deal. But, y’know, who just puts someone to sleep when they’re driving? She musta known what could happen.”

                    “Maybe it was an accident? Or she panicked, or-”

                    “Not much better. Look, you know there’s basically two kinds of villains out there. Nuisances, and <em>threats.</em> If someone’s just messin’ around pranking people or doing a bit of shoplifting... who cares, right? But like, you start <em>killing</em> people; that’s when it gets serious. That’s when you gotta be stopped. Honestly, she should be happy it’s just me lookin’ for her and not someone more important.”

                    “... What are you going to do if you find her?”

                    “We’re gonna fight, I’m gonna win, and I’m gonna hand her over to the cops. After that, it’s not my problem. And, hey, if you see her again, you mind giving me a call? Maybe stall her a little? I’m pretty fast, so it shouldn’t take long to get there.” A pause. “Unless you’re, like, <em>way</em> out there. Where’d you run into her before?”

                    “N-not that far. On one of the western commuter rail lines, a little past the airport.”

                    “Uh, sure. I’ll let you know.”

                    They arrived back near the river not long after, joining up with the whole crew from the night’s work. Lapis refused to admit she had helped with any of the cleanup, Granite was willing to support her lie as he wasn’t ready to risk the seemingly fragile peace, and Mahogany and Justice returned from disposing of the eel only a little before Strawberry and Silver touched down.

                    “Wouldn’t believe what we found in there,” he said. “Wanna guess?”

                    “More eyes?” Strawberry tried, while Silver admitted “Not really.”

                    “Nope! It was a guy!” He pointed down the street a bit; the newly-arrived heroes turned to look. There was a group of maybe five slime-covered people being attended to by paramedics from a pair of ambulances parked a little further down. “And some other people, too. That guy was first, though.”

                    “The eel ate them?” Silver observed at the same time as Strawberry exclaimed “It didn’t kill them?”

                    “Yesno!” Mahogany replied to both at once. “Looks like it’s not very good at digesting people, and those teeth - surprised me too - aren’t that sharp. Like, I gave one a good whack and it was too dull to even chip my plates. So, I guess not everyone’s been found yet, but so far we haven’t seen a single dead body! I think we did prreeeeetttyyy gooooood!”

                    “Yeah we did!” Strawberry twirled around to offer a high-five to Lapis, who was sneaking away. “You too, girl! C’mon, you can be happy too!”

                    “You four can throw your own little party; I’ve got my own stuff to do.”

                    “Aw, you wanna check on your friends you wanted to protect, right? I hope they’re okay!”

                    “That! Is your <em>guess</em>, and not what I am going to do.”

                    She was cut off by Lapis pushing her back towards the other three. “Can you promise you won’t text me every goddamn day about something stupid?”

                    Strawberry gasped. “You’re not saying no?! ‘Course I can promise that!”

                    “... Yeah, no. I don’t believe you for a second.”

                    “But-but-”

                    “If - and ONLY if - somethin’ else big comes up... maybe.” She turned away. “See ya chumps later.”

                    “Aww maaaaan,” Strawberry whined a little later. “She didn’t even say no...”

                    “Isn’t that something to be pleased about?” Granite asked. “Although, if something else big comes up, that would certainly be nothing to be pleased about...”

                    “I wonder if they’re gonna reschedule the fireworks since they never did the second course?” Mahogany wondered out loud, then shook his head like he just remembered something. “Hey, anyway, Sil, you should go find your folks, right? You came here with ‘em; they’re gonna be real worried if you don’t show up.”

                    “Y-yeah, I really should go. Good job, everyone. Maybe we can team up again sometime. But if we do-” She glared at Mahogany and Granite. “-you guys <em>gotta</em> tell me the plan <em>before</em> launching me a hundred feet in the air. Okay? That was <em>not</em> fun.”

                    “Sorry, boss! Got too excited; G usually stops me. Do my best not to next time!”

                    “Yes, apologies. It seemed more certain in the moment.”

                    “It’s okay,” she relented. “Just... be more careful.”

                    <em>??? ???th, ???</em>

                    “You’ve chosen an interesting vessel for your gambit,” hummed a soft, rich voice. “I wonder how well it will serve you?”

                    “Why are you even here? Go play with your own toys!” responded a higher, sharper tone.

                    “My, my. That’s no way to respond to your elder,” the rich voice murmured with a dangerous undercurrent. “Why don’t you try that again?”

                    “Why don’t you leave me alone? I’m busy!”

                    “Why don’t you <em>make me?</em>”

                    A pause. Briefly, you wondered who you were.

                    “S-sorry,” muttered the higher voice. Something shuffled across a surface. Papers rustled. “I’m just... stressed.”

                    “Hmph. See to it that you recall your manners in the future. Though you may hold this role presently, your grip is weak. You need me <em>far</em> more than I need you. There are many who would replace you in a heartbeat.”

                    An even quieter tone. “Sorry...”

                    “Don’t be sorry. Be better.” A light tap of sound. “Show me.”

                    A deep breath; the higher voice recovered some of its strength. “This is it, so far.” A series of vibrations drummed on a rigid material right next to you. Briefly, you wondered what you were.

                    “This is all you’ve managed? It’s disgusting.”

                    “It’s more than what it looks like! Listen!”

                    Some rustling and a brief clank. “This isn’t a proper heartbeat,” the rich voice declared. “It’s malformed.”

                    “It <em>is</em> proper!” the higher voice protested. “It’s just got more chambers than humans do! It does a sort of 3-2 thing - look, I diagrammed it earlier. See?”

                    Some clicks, like keypresses. Briefly, you wonder why you’re here, listening to this conversation.

                    “Are they all like this, or just your malformed sample here?”

                    “It depends. Some of them are more normal; some are even weirder. Some don’t even use a heart at all; they’re more like giant cells that don’t even need a blood analogue to live.”

So it has a heartbeat. It’s still nothing but sludge. You have made hardly any progress since the last check-in. If the schedule slips any further, you will be replaced.”

                    “No!” the higher voice exclaimed. “No; there’s no need for that! I’ve made progress. This one can make eyes!”

                    “Show me.”

                    “...” Some uncertain noises. You felt... bulgy. Then, with a slick glopping sound, portions of your outer membrane tore open to flood your newly-manifested eyes with light.

                    “It’s not focusing.”

                    “It’s basically blind! It’s never had eyes before; give it a minute!”

                    “Pah.”

                    Slowly, shapes swam into a semblance of focus. Through a filmy grid of hexagonal blotches, you started to make out form and color. So bright; everything was nearly whited-out with illumination. Two shadows loomed over you, one dramatically taller than the other.

                    “See? See? Look, it’s paying attention. Hey, look over here please!” The smaller shadow waved an appendage; you involuntarily tracked its movement. “Look, it’s looking at me!”

                    “Creature. Attention.”

                    The taller shadow didn’t move, but you could tell it was the one speaking. Curious, you looked over to see if you could make out any indication of how it was doing that. No such luck.

                    “It looked at you! See, the eye was right here, but now-”

                    “I can tell. At least you’ve done <em>something</em> in the last two weeks, but of course this is nowhere near enough. If you wish to keep your position, you must improve more quickly.”

                    “...” The smaller figure shuffled on the spot. Your hexagons subdivided with an audible schlorp, improving your vision’s clarity by a dramatic amount. You wondered if you could do that again. Maybe you could see the speaker better. “Then let me show this to my vessel. If I can-”

                    “Absolutely not.”

                    “But, if I can-”

Your hexagons subdivided again; you could almost start to make out details. “Under absolutely no circumstances can any humans ever learn what we’re doing here. You know this. Put it out of your head.”

                    The smaller figure’s voice was shaky now, but they tried a third time. “I-I know that. But - please listen - if I can erase her memories of this place every time, it shouldn’t be a problem.”

                    “You don’t have the power.”

                    “But <em>you</em> do.”

                    “...”

                    The hexagon blotches were now so small as to almost blend together. You could make out details with reasonable clarity. You sat on a bland white table in a bland white room, surrounded by machinery that you could not comprehend. The two speakers stood in front of you, both wearing bland white outfits to go with the bland white room. The smaller one had a palette of pastel reds, oranges, and yellows; the taller one of deep blues, purples, and greens. You didn’t understand why their bodies looked like that; why they were so rigid and solid. Anti-malleable. It didn’t make sense.

                    “Please; I promise I can make the deadline if I can just get-”

                    “Quiet.”

                    The smaller one took a step back, quickly falling silent. You wondered why they reacted like they did to the taller one. You wondered if you could ask. After all, you had just heard a lot of speech; surely you could do that too.

                    “bxsgfh,” you said, doing your best.

                    Both figures immediately turned to look at you. “What is it doing?” the taller one asked, in its soft, dangerous tone from the start of all this.

                    “I... I don’t know. How did it...?” The smaller figure looked at you, leaning over the table till you could make out eyes and an opening beneath, which moved when it spoke. How did it form sounds so cleanly? “Excuse me; er, were you talking to us?”

                    “gjrplisv,” you replied, trying a different technique.

I promise I’ll make super sure she never goes back with anything - you can even check if you want!”

                    The taller figure sighed. “You can hardly be ahead of schedule when the current schedule is already <em>years</em> behind. Fine. You may enlist your vessel for assistance, but if <em>anything</em> goes wrong in any way, you must kill it.”

                    “P-personally?”

                    “Yes. If you cannot agree, you cannot bring it here.”

                    The smaller figure seemed nervous. “ygbsrplip,” you advised, trying to be helpful.

                    They glanced at you. “Okay. I... I’ll do it. But only if I have to.”

                    “Of course.” The taller figure turned, moving out of your field of view. “Begin immediately. Check-ins will be every week now. If you miss any more deliverables, you will be dismissed.”

                    A heavy metallic clank, as of a closing door. The smaller figure hesitated for a few moments, bringing their appendages up to their head and making several unhappy noises. Then, “It’s okay,” the smaller figure whispered in your direction. “You’ll make sure that doesn’t happen, right?”

                    “asgurmpj,” you affirmed, not really clear what they were asking.

                    <em>July 19th, 2028</em>
                    Bria was starting to get the hang of this.

                    The two-ish weeks after the eel incident on July 4th were a lot quieter than the ones before, which was good. Despite her battle form’s enhanced durability and healing capabilities, she had legitimately injured her leg and had to keep weight off it for a while as it recovered. That meant a lot of sitting around at home, or at the library, or occasionally in a car while in transit to somewhere more exciting. Mom wouldn’t let her go anywhere on her own until fully healed, telling her to treat it like a grounding for running off in the crowd like that. Bria supposed that was fair.

                    This didn’t quite mean a cessation of hero activities, however. While she flatly refused Zeal’s prodding to go out anyway, she certainly didn’t waste all the time sitting around at home. Objects bounced all over Bria’s room at odd hours of the day as she learned new ways to control momentum. “Reflection” was turning out to be an extremely versatile type signature magic - so far, her biggest limit was just that the powerful stuff could only work from her hands.

                    Somewhat surprisingly, some of her hero friends kept in touch. Obviously, none of them could actually visit due to the whole secret identity thing, but she received texts, pictures, and videos of varying degrees of sincerity from everyone who had been present. Except Lapis, who hadn’t given out her number. But she did hear about her secondhand from Strawberry and Hog, who were both still chasing her down for ostensibly different but probably fairly similar reasons. The three of them got into a few more fights, during which Lapis won or escaped every time, but that didn’t seem to bother either of the heroes much.

                    But she hadn’t heard anything about Violet.

Was she just lying low? Scheming? Something else?

                    Bria wouldn’t normally be thinking much about her, but today just felt so much like the day of her first hero fight that it was on her mind. She had finally been cleared to walk on her own again just yesterday - having healed more quickly than anyone but her had expected - and was out on a hot summer’s day around noon. Wandering by the same cafe from before and vaguely considering stopping by the train station just to check for any villains. You know, for fun.

                    Despite all that, it was still a surprise for Zeal to pop into visibility from somewhere above, hover to a near-stop just in front of her face, and announce “That hero of darkness from before is back” in a calm, almost disinterested voice.

                    “Huh? Wh-what? Who? Which one?”

                    “Oh, you know. The one that frilly pink menace won’t stop bothering us about.”

                    “Violet? Are you kidding?”

                    “When have I ever kidded?”

                    “... Right.” Bria ducked behind a barricade blocking off view from the main street. A few moments later, Silver hopped out instead. “Which way?”

                    “Who knows?” He kind of drifted in a circle, almost yawning. “Who cares?”

                    “If you don’t care, why did you tell me at all?” On a whim, Silver ran for the train station. It was as good an idea as any, given where they had last fought.

                    “You care,” he responded. “So I saw no need to hide the information from your attention.”

                    “Wait - pink-” Silver remembered a few weeks back, when she had kinda-sorta agreed to tell a certain someone if a certain different someone reappeared. “Is Strawberry anywhere nearby? Is she gonna be able to sense anything?”

I doubt it. Her partner may be skilled in detection, but even Compassion would have trouble over a distance this great. Besides, they are at the waterfront today and will likely not be leaving.”

                    “How do you know that?”

                    “How indeed, I wonder?”

                    “Whatever. Let’s go.” She had made good progress dealing with Zeal’s... personality. Basically, it was always easier to just let it go than to try and argue with him on stuff like this. Much less frustrating, too. Sometimes she pretended he was cryptic like this because of some global rules for angels where they couldn’t be too helpful in order to let their heroes grow on their own terms. Who knew; it could be true! Zeal certainly wouldn’t tell her if it was!

                    “So,” he asked blandly. “What will you do when you arrive?”

                    “Hm?”

                    “I notice you have made no move to alert your ally. Do you intend on fighting independently?”

                    “Well... y-yeah, basically.”

                    “Hm. Your confidence has improved. We shall see if your intent has grown to match it.”

                    Silver didn’t miss a step, but she did hesitate briefly. She had been assuming this whole time that Violet hadn’t <em>intentionally</em> killed anyone. But, if she actually had, her intent would be... certainly stronger than Silver’s, who still hadn’t changed much of her approach towards non-monster adversaries. <em>But with my reflection, it doesn’t matter how strong the attack is. I can just turn it around.</em>

                    That was a dangerous thing to think, and she knew it. Overconfidence killed. But really, Violet wouldn’t try to kill her. She hadn’t last time. It would be fine.

                    She arrived at the station. A familiar-looking villain lounged idly on a bench. Waiting for her.

                    “Hey,” Violet said, hopping to a standing position. “No old people around this time to talk my ear off. Isn’t that nice?”

                    “Aren’t you paranoid,” she needled, sidling closer. “What if I said I wasn’t here for a fiiiiight?~”

                    “I guess I’d ask again. Why are you here?”

                    “What if I said it wasn’t even anything eevviiiiilll?~” Another foot of subtle approach.

                    “Are you going to answer my question or not?”

                    “I wanna race!~”

                    “... Race?”

                    “To that crossing light,” she said, pointing. Silver turned to look, allowing Violet another few discreet steps forward. “The first one to touch the cross-thingy wins!”

                    “W - it’s called a crossbuck,” she clarified automatically, remembering her dad’s - hold on! “Hold on,” she echoed her thoughts. “Why?”

                    “Cause I wanna see who’s faster, duh.”

                    “Uh... no thanks.”

                    A pause. “Huh? Why not?”

                    “It’s gonna be some sort of trick, right?” Silver retreated back into the sun, suddenly aware of how close Violet had gotten in the past minute or so. “You’ll have trapped the route with an invisible death-mist bubble or something. Or you’re gonna try to attach some really high stakes. Or both!”

                    “So paranoid!” she accused again. “You really think I’d cheat like that?”

                    “I mean... yes?”

                    “How mean! After I came all the way out here, too!” She didn’t seem that different from the last time they had met; no visible guilt about what she had allegedly done. Energetic, probably trying to do more villainous things. Maybe Silver had been wrong, actually. Or maybe she should try asking. “So, what, you’re only here to fight me? That didn’t go great for you last time.”

                    For some reason, that comment just rubbed Silver the wrong way. After all the thinking she had done about Violet’s innocence, she just showed up here and antagonized her? Really? “I’ve gotten stronger since then.”

                    “Yeah? Me too.”

                    The divide of sunlight and shade mirrored the heroes of light and darkness facing each other under the edge of the station’s roof, although the symbolism was lost on both of them at the time. Even without being otherwise preoccupied, it would have been a silly thing to notice regardless. However, the sharp illuminative contrast certainly made it harder to make out quick details - such as a sudden motion from Silver that might have looked like the start of an attack, but was actually just an instinctive swat at an unexpected bug.

                    Violet raised both hands into the air, yelling something indistinctly as the shaded concrete between them swelled, rising up into an almost wave-like structure at a rapid pace. This pushed Violet back while bumping Silver into the air and giving her immediate flashbacks to the last time something like this had happened.

Her ankle tingled. Barely healed, here she was abusing it again. “Hey-”

                    “Poison mist!” Violet cut her off, drawing a translucent bubble in midair.

                    Silver choked on her words - or, rather, she choked on the poison - but didn’t just run out of the bubble this time. Instead, she pressed her hands together and formed a weak reflective barrier similar to the one that held off the rain, but designed to act on much smaller particles. Air, in this case. Or, rather, poison.

                    “---” She coughed again. Nope, that did not work. Not only did breathing still hurt, but it also seemed much harder than before, like trying to inhale through a thick cloth. She hurried out of the cloud normally while letting the barrier drop, well aware that having stood around long enough to try would give Violet time to attack again.

                    “Shadow mist.”

                    This one again. But unlike before, Silver wasn’t pinned against a building; she was in the open on the platform. All she had to do to escape the cloud was pick a direction and walk.

                    Except that Violet could apparently control shadows now. Right. The borders of the cloud shrank, somehow exerting physical force despite being made of... literally nothing: the absence of light. It felt a little like what she imagined being buried in giant beanbags might feel like: squishy, uncomfortable, and very heavy. Also, reflectable.

                    The cloud burst apart from two horizontal jets on either side as Silver reflected the inward momentum into two much sharper points of outward momentum at her hands. The entire thing deflated like a... well, a beanbag, perhaps, with the beans removed, causing the cloud to lose cohesion and fade vaguely away to wisps of fragile darkness, then nothing at all.

Violet wasn’t standing at the station anymore. “Wait, where-” Another pause as she looked around. “Where’d you go? You can’t go invisible or anything, right?”

                    “...”

                    Warily, Silver looked closer at the station; there wasn’t anywhere else she could have gotten to in time. “Zeal, did she transform back or something?”

                    Hovering overhead and gently drifting towards the station along her sightline, he responded bluntly. “No.”

                    “So she’s still here <em>somewhere,</em>” she murmured, cautiously advancing towards the building. “Maybe she just went inside? Trying an ambush or something?”

                    “...”

                    “It’s really quiet,” she whispered, ostensibly to Zeal. “Weren’t there more people around before?”

                    He didn’t respond, so she just kept going. The station didn’t have much of an inside - just a small waiting area with some bathrooms - and windows provided a good look into everywhere public from out here. No Violet anywhere, though if she <em>had</em> managed to escape notice earlier, she could be just about anywhere nearby at this point.

                    “I don’t like this...” Silver muttered, glancing around in all directions. “Where are you?”

                    <em>Scene 43</em>
                    Maybe the roof? She could have gotten up there with her shadow bounce trick, probably, and wouldn’t be visible from the ground. But how could Silver get up? There wasn’t a staircase or convenient ladder that she knew of. Could she just climb up one of the posts? After one attempt, it became clear that she could not. Her battle form was stronger, sure, but not quite strong enough to climb without any decent handholds. But that did give her a different idea. It was something she had been practicing a little bit before getting hurt, but hadn’t got anywhere near proficient. But she didn’t have to be <em>good</em> to get just a few feet of extra height.

                    “Hmm...” Silver hummed uncertainly as she tapped her foot on the ground. This wouldn’t be good for it, but it would only be a few hops. With a quick leap, she jumped a normal height, then tried to time it so she extended her legs just as she hit the ground - to deliver maximum force in the impact. Although she was the one moving, not the ground, the relative momentum was the same and she could reflect herself back into the air for more distance, as if she were bouncing on a trampoline.

                    Of course, all that force went straight to her ankles rather than getting gently dispersed by a soft, stretchy surface. Like stomping on concrete from a foot in the air.

In simple scenarios - like reflecting a projectile while she wasn’t moving, or bouncing herself off an immoble object - her power made sense: take the moving thing and make it go the other direction with the same speed. But in more complicated scenarios, like when both herself and the other thing were moving, or at different angles, or - in this case - if some parts of her were moving at different speeds than her center of mass, it was less clear what the results would be. Zeal said regular physics didn’t need to apply (duh), and the outcomes would be a result of her “inner understanding of the concept.” It might even change over time, especially if she studied the physics that her powers interacted with! Some heroes had done that, though outcomes were mixed in whether the changes were beneficial or not.

                    Anyway, the upshot to all that was that - for some reason, unlike being bounced off Granite’s huge stone columns - it seemed kicking off the ground like this actually transferred some portion of the force to her legs like it normally would, instead of reflecting it entirely into just more speed. Not all of it or she’d never gain height, but enough to cause a nontrivial amount of pain in that injured ankle.

                    But it only took her two bounces before she could catch onto the gutter and kick off the post from earlier to get a leg up too. At that point, she could roll onto the roof and just barely get her hands up in time to reflect a barrage of inky-black streamers.

                    Well, most of them.

                    As she had thought, Violet was on the roof too, crouching behind a decorative chimney and weaving a series of ribbon-like shade projections through the air towards her. They seemed to be pretty fragile - the reflected ones just broke apart with the sudden change in direction - but there sure were a lot of them. Silver couldn’t catch every single one with just two hands.

She changed tactics quickly upon seeing just how delicate they were, and returned to that whole-body barrier that had failed to stop the poison. Here, it was much more effective. Each streamer was too light to resist, but also not too small to just pass through entirely. With only the concentration needed to maintain the barrier, Silver was effectively immune to this particular attack.

                    “Ugh!” Violet yelled, standing up suddenly. “Why are you like this? How did you even know where to go?”

                    “I guessed?”

                    That just seemed to frustrate her more. A call of “shadow mist!” buried the roof in darkness; Silver shuffled sideways to get away from the edge. At least she could tell which way that was due to the roof’s slope, but not much else. Last time, Violet hadn’t been able to see through her own darkness (so it seemed, at least), but if she could this time, Silver would <em>really</em> be at a disadvantage. She couldn’t reflect the darkness away, and it would be too hard to react to any attacks by sound alone. She could jump off the roof, but that wouldn’t really help her end the fight. So... what should she do?

                    Well...

                    “Why did you kill those police officers?” was the best she could come up with. Inelegant and <em>certainly</em> poor timing, but at this point it was looking less and less likely she’d get a better chance. At least Violet wasn’t attacking her at this exact moment.

                    The response was immediate, almost cutting off the end of Silver’s sentence. “What are you talking about? I bet you don’t even know who it was.”

                    Okay, so she was still on the roof; she hadn’t run off again. Good. “A couple of weeks ago, you stole a truck or something like that. Two people died in the chase. I want to know why.”

                    “That could have been anyone. You weren’t there.”

                    “You don’t know I wasn’t, if you weren’t.” A brief pause, but she didn’t want to leave it at that. “I wasn’t there, though, you’re right. But the whole incident is real and a lot of people saw you. And a certain hero mentioned your name.”

                    “That fruit-themed-” A pause. “Is she on her way, then? I’m surprised it’s taken this long.”

                    “I didn’t tell her. I wanted to ask you what happened first.”

                    “Listen, I didn’t kill anyone. I was just trying to get away and I put down some mist on the road and it’s <em>their fault</em> they were driving so fast or that they kept going after or... or that they just didn’t know how to drive! All it even did was make people sleepy, not even poison or blindness or anything! There would have been so much time to realize and stop the car! It’s not - nothing even happened, but even if it <em>did</em>, it wasn’t my fault.”

She wasn’t sure how she felt about that, actually. Probably good that it hadn’t been intentional, but... well, assuming Violet wasn’t lying about this, it meant that... What <em>did</em> it mean? She had still killed them, even indirectly. She couldn’t just <em>overlook</em> that, right? Just let her go? Ignore it and move on? Maybe Strawberry was right after all; just let the cops deal with it through the normal legal system. That would be the right thing to do, right? It would be fair. Right? Just... getting away with it wouldn’t be.

                    Right?

                    “You happy now?” Violet asked from a different point on the roof. Silver shifted to the new direction, still blind in the cloud. The shadows weren’t pressing on her, so she still couldn’t reflect them. “Ready to get on with it?”

                    “You still want to fight after all that? Why are you even here?” she asked yet again.

                    “I told you at the start! You just didn’t want to believe me!” Another change of position. How was she moving so quickly without making any noise?

                    “You really came all the way here <em>just</em> to race me? ... Why?”

                    “You just don’t GET IT!”

                    Silver was unexpectedly and quite violently punched square in the face.

                    The shock of the impact honestly did more than the actual momentum, but the result was the same: she stumbled back and fell off the roof. Despite the confusion and rapid drop, however, she had sort of been expecting something to happen and managed to bounce back up and out of the cloud with a twirl that looked more graceful than it felt. She landed on one knee back on the station platform, holding her head as blood trickled from her nose. She probably could have blocked if she hadn’t been blind and distracted by the conversation and the stress of holding up her barrier against the shadow snakes that Violet hadn’t even used a second time. Silver let it drop, trying to refocus through her new headache.

                    Silver didn’t have time to reject that assessment. She leapt sideways to escape the bulk of the torrent, which swept mostly past her to splash onto the tracks like so much pitch-dark water. Still, even the edge was enough to send her tumbling dizzily across concrete to come to a painful stop near the main road. On her back and upside-down, her gaze settled on a pastel, cat-adjacent creature hovering disapproving above her.

                    “Do you understand intent <em>now</em>, Silver?” Zeal asked insufferably, as if this were just another one of their training sessions. “Your opponent certainly seems to. You would do well to ‘get your act together’ if you wish to survive this encounter.”

                    “-gg ovv,” she coughed, wiping blood off her face and struggling to stand up. It was probably time to run away at this point; she was already badly hurt and-

                    Violet screamed wordlessly and the ground bulged with a dark, ink-like liquid. She slid across the pavement like a skier, raising more and more evil-looking black streamers at an unbelievable rate. Silver scrambled to her feet, pain almost forgotten with a jolt of legitimate fear.

                    Another quick dodge, this time with an extra reflection, launched her clear across the parking lot to tumble to a stop near an intersection. Near the level crossing Violet had wanted to race to, actually. Meanwhile, Violet herself shouted something else, trailing void streamers from her limbs and drawing a web of thin cracks in the pavement where she walked.

                    Silver ran for it. She ducked around a few parked cars to get onto the sidewalk and slipped around a side entrance to backtrack closer to the rails. Out of view; no one looking. Time to change back and-

                    And what?

Would she worry about murdering an <em>actual</em> civilian? There hadn’t been anyone around the station for some reason, but there had absolutely been a lot of people just a few blocks away. What if she went further into town?

                    She hesitated, listening to concrete snap and shadow-ribbons whistle through the air.

                    How was Violet this strong? Even with the “right intent,” as Zeal would probably put it, there was a limit to how much magic heroes’ bodies could store. He told her that. Draining too much power would cause you to revert back to your base form. How much was too much? How long could she keep this up? And even if Silver went back out there, could she even stop her?

                    <em>Scene 45</em>
                    Maybe she didn’t need to stop her. Maybe that thought from a few seconds ago would be enough; that heroes couldn’t access unlimited amounts of power. If Silver could just keep her occupied and make her waste all her magic, it’d be over. At least, assuming she could stay alive for however long it took to accomplish that goal.

                    More crashing from the main street. Car engines revved; there were other people here. Silver shook off her doubts and ran back into danger.

                    This is what it meant to be a hero.

                    Violet was a block further down the street, streamers of darkness wrapping around buildings, traffic lights, and a few unlucky cars in the middle of trying to reverse or turn around. Solid materials bent; cracked. The shadows were unreasonably powerful, even under the glare of a near-midday sun. Maybe even because of it. After all, darkness only grew more defined in the presence of light.

                    “Back here!” she shouted. “Didn’t you want to race?”

                    Violet didn’t respond with words, but her attention was certainly clear. Darkness dripped from her body, pooling around her feet and feeding into the network of streamers. Even more grew as she turned towards Silver, shouting something in overlapping tones too garbled to make out.

                    “What was tha - gaH!”

                    Silver sprinted back the way she came as Violet blasted off the road fast enough to pulverize a section of pavement. Streamers whipped at the gap as she overshot, pulling her back and seeking for Silver. Violet’s movement was becoming less reminiscent of a human’s by the moment, instead starting to resemble a sort of strange suspended puppet, pulled along by streamers of darkness rather than driven from a central body. It was creepy, sure, but more than that: it was <em>fast</em>.

Every time, the combined Violet / giant mass of darkness “thing” would overshoot, skitter past while changing direction, and often crash into some other solid object on the other side. Destruction followed, but Silver managed to maintain enough of a lead to avoid running too far outside the mysteriously empty zone around the station. No one - yet - had been seriously hurt.

                    ... Seriously, where were all the people? There weren’t any trains right now, but this place was right near the center of downtown. And <em>no one</em> was here?

                    Despite her misgivings about the emptiness, it was certainly extremely convenient. Silver managed almost fifteen minutes of near-constant running, buoyed occasionally by reflecting herself at high speeds when Violet managed to catch up and attack her. The shadow-streamer things actually had more mass than the original ones, which meant if she could catch one with her hands, she could use the reflection to launch herself huge distances and gain a lot of ground. Somehow, Violet never seemed to catch onto this trick; she always attacked in the same way every time she caught up. More screaming in garbled, contradictory, incomprehensible voices. From appearance to behavior, right now she hardly seemed human.

                    And then, with an almost comical suddenness, Silver’s plan worked.

Violet hurtled into the bricks of one of the framing buildings just down the road, then gathered speed to charge towards her. Silver, knowing she would be unable to move in time, braced herself for another reflection to launch herself probably across the main road again.

                    And then all the shadows winked out in an instant. Violet stumbled and fell into an inelegant tumble to land in a heap a few feet further down the sidewalk. Silver hesitated, almost not daring to believe she had done it.

                    Her breath caught. Violet wasn’t Violet anymore. Her magic had run out and, just as Zeal had warned her right at the start, a battle form took energy to maintain. The girl lying on the ground was blonde instead and - shockingly - familiar.

                    “You’re the one who found me when it was raining,” she whispered. Then, something else clicked. “You’re the one who was sitting in the station the very first time we fought! You never left at all!”

                    She hurried forward and knelt down next to... what was her name, again? “Violet” would have to do for now; her mind was too scrambled to remember. “Hey, are you okay? That was a bad fall.” A pause. “... Are you alive...?” Silver strained to remember what she was supposed to do in a situation like this. Not move them, probably? Should she call 911? What if Violet woke up and started attacking everyone again, though!

                    Silver was spared having to make a decision by Violet groaning and slowly pushing herself off the ground into a kneeling position, with some help she hardly noticed receiving. She had rough-looking scrapes on her hands and forehead, but didn’t seem seriously hurt. “Wh... y-you’re... still here?”

                    “And I’m glad you’re okay,” Silver decided. “Feeling a little less angry now?”

                    “Lillian!” Silver exclaimed, finally remembering. “That’s right, <em>Violet.</em> It wasn’t on purpose, but I saw you transform back. And you know what that means.”

                    “No no no nono; no you didn’t... you don’t...”

                    “I do. Now, I think we have some things to talk about.”

                    <em>Scene 46</em>
                    What happened? What was going on? Lillian could hardly remember how she had gotten here or what she had been doing for most of the day. However, at least two things were very clear. One: she had done something very bad, given all the damaged infrastructure and the very mad-looking hero dragging her along. And two: Silver knew her secret identity.

                    The thought alone was terrifying. It usually felt right to be Violet <em>while</em> Violet, but Lillian was under no impression that anyone else would feel the same way. Even her normal antics would be enough to land her in jail, probably, but this most recent stuff was way more extreme. If Silver told the cops - worse, if she told her <em>parents</em>...

                    She recognized their location now; Silver was leading her towards the secluded clearing in the woods where she had been training the last time they had met. For privacy, probably, but what was she going to do once there? Yell at her? <em>Kill</em> her? Lillian scanned the skies and lower branches, looking for Vanity but unsure whether her presence would be reassuring or not. That uncertainty was resolved in only a few seconds as she spotted the demon fluttering along behind them and immediately felt even more sick. Definitely not reassuring. What had she done? Little flashes were starting to come back, none of them good.

                    That was the point, of course - she was the villain - but that thought wasn’t very convincing right now.

                    There was a little stone bench with tiny tendrils of ivy growing up the legs. Silver sat her down on it, then stepped back, folding her arms. She looked a lot more intimidating like this than before. “... Okay, what changed?”

                    “... What?”

                    “You didn’t try to kill me last time. You didn’t turn into a horrible goopy shadow monster. Heck, the last time <em>you</em> were here - not Violet - we even had a nice little chat. What changed?”
                    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1353110577282678937 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1353110577282678937><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, March 22, 2025 4:58 PM">4:58 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“...” What had changed? Nothing really, except the scale. Things had been escalating over the past month or so, with every outing as Violet leaving her feeling the need to cause more chaos than the one before. Then, there had been that one where she stole the semi truck and...

                    She hadn’t transformed for a while after that. But not for a lack of prodding. Vanity didn’t seem to understand why she didn’t want to go out again and kept feeding her ideas, complaining she was boring, and idly but pointedly wondering what would happen to a villain who didn’t want to be one anymore. Would she really be satisfied just going back to her everyday life after getting a taste of this one? The power; the thrill?

                    Eventually, she had agreed. Eventually, she had gone out again. Taken the train all the way here, to face off against her first hero again. But not to do anything evil; just to get the hang of transforming again. Certainly nothing to actually hurt anyone.

                    And yet.

                    “Well?” Silver prompted. “You can’t just say ‘nothing’ - or were you just pretending before?”

                    She always felt different in her battle form. Was that really her? Surely - <em>surely</em> Lillian wouldn’t have done any of this. “Every time I transform lately,” she began, “I’ve been feeling this <em>need</em> to do something bigger than the last time. I tried to slow down after... th-that thing you asked about, but... it didn’t work. I think the battle form might be, um, ch-changing me?”

                    Silver looked alarmed, then maybe a little sympathetic, then alarmed again when Vanity swooped down from the trees making a loud “BZZZZZT!” noise. “Wrong!” she shouted, spinning around them in a figure-eight. Silver tried to duck out of the pattern, making it clear Vani had made herself visible to <em>both</em> of them.

                    “Hey - get - what do you mean?!” she exclaimed, swatting at the demon like an extra-large mosquito.

                    “Hold on,” Silver said before Lillian could decide how to respond. “It does, though. When I transform, I get a lot more confident and... I guess, used to dealing with dangerous situations? I don’t think I’d ever go fight a monster without that. What do you mean that’s wrong?”

                    “Nope, that’s right!” she said happily, spinning up in a loop-de-loop. “Battle forms give ya more confidence, focus, energy; that kinda thing. Makes ya better at fightin’, but also just more put together and sometimes even a bit hyper.” A pause; she swooped down to press against Lillian’s forehead. A bit of sticky blood came away on her fur. “But it never gives ya anything you didn’t already have. If you don’t like whatcha see, take a good hard look in the mirror.”

                    “That can’t be true,” she said softly. “I’m almost like a different person when transformed; I hardly even remember what happened today.”

                    “It’s truuuee~! Maybe you’re just so unconfident when you’re not transformed you don’t even recognize yourself! But it’s all there even right now; you just gotta dig deep.” She mimed shoveling motions to match.

                    “Maybe I should quit, then.”

                    Silence for a moment. “Woah woah woah; hold up. Whyyy, Vi-o-let~? You get to be so cool~!”

                    “I lose control; I’m not me. I...” She still couldn’t say it. “... hurt people.”

                    “I don’t get what the big deal is - but even if you think so, we can fix that~! Some gumption; some practice!”

                    “...”

                    Silver considered it for a moment, both deciding what she thought about the idea and whether she should say anything at all. But, well, she was here and Vanity hadn’t stayed hidden from her, so she was part of the conversation... “I don’t think there’s anything wrong with not being a villain,” she eventually said. “If you’re hurting people now, and you’re saying how you lose control sometimes, maybe it is better to just quit. You get to just be yourself instead.”

                    “...”

                    “But then you’d go back to just being lame and boring and sad! Didn’t you say you wanted to be cool when we first met? Aren’t you cool now?”

                    “Sometimes...”

                    “Then you get to stay!” Vani declared as if she had just proven something. “And if you <em>really</em> want to change something, we can change it!”

                    “I don’t know if that’s going to work so easily,” Silver warned. “It seems like your battle form is really different from your real personality; like it’d be hard to try and put them back together...”

                    “You don’t know anything~ about this,” Vani called, still spinning and only seeming to be getting faster. “Why don’tcha keep your mouth shut, mmkay~?”

                    “B...because I think you’re trying to corrupt someone who’s clearly trying to do the right thing?” Silver replied, kind of taken aback by the question. “Like, why do demons even want to partner with heroes at all? To make more monsters; to cause more chaos; to make everything worse! You <em>know</em> that: look what you - er, Violet - just did right here! You <em>can</em> say no and start helping instead of hurting!”

                    “That’s not how it woooorks~! Plus, we’d have to split if you quit and that’d be real saaad~.”

                    “That’s not a real reason! If you’re going to say I’m wrong, you need to say why!”

Look, she’s just tryin’ to make you give up all this, for <em>her</em> benefit...~”

                    “Th-that’s not true!”

                    “You gotta say whyyyy,” she winked. “If you think I’m wrong~.”

                    Mostly forgotten in the escalating shouting match, Lillian tried to think. It was hard to feel confident in her decisions, given... well, yeah, but she was pretty sure she really <em>didn’t</em> want to give up her powers. In a life of rigid structure, being able to just do what <em>she</em> wanted for a bit was... was... something, at least. The question of whether it was what “Lillian” wanted or what “Violet” wanted could be solved, probably, with some confidence - assuming Vanity was right. It couldn’t be that hard now that she was aware of the problem. Surely.

                    Still, she didn’t quite believe Silver was arguing like this just to make her job easier. It wasn’t like they knew each other well, but it did require some level of commitment to the ideals of justice to take the mantle of a hero of light, right? Maybe it was really as simple as wanting to stop her from hurting anyone else, or maybe there was some concern for Lillian in there too.

                    Maybe this decision was a little too big to make right now.

                    “I think-” she began, but neither Vani nor Silver was paying attention. “Er, I think-” she tried again, again to no avail. “...”

                    Someone landed gently on the bench next to her. Lillian looked down, taking in the smooth, pastel coloration. An angel. Silver’s angel, probably.

                    “You could always do both, you know,” he said softly. “Quit being a villain while keeping your powers.”

                    “... You mean...?”

You would have to dispense with that... unsavory character currently providing your abilities, but I’m certain you would have few issues maintaining a relationship with any number of my kin.”

                    “Even after... what I did...?”

                    He shrugged. “Accidents happen. It’s not as if you pulled the trigger yourself.” A pause, though not one of hesitation. “And many heroes of light seem far too reluctant to manifest the intent necessary to win. You have shown yourself capable of doing so.”

                    Somehow, that statement hardly seemed angelic. “I could... I’ll... think about it.”

                    “See to it that you do. And you always know how to communicate your answer.”

                    “HEY! Get away from my Violet!” Vanity exclaimed, finally noticing what was going on and breaking away from her shouting match with Silver. “Shoo! Get!” She swooped in, pushing Zeal away; he drifted off with a smile to hover vaguely near Silver. “He didn’t say anything weird, right? That tricksy grumpster...” A brief growl.

                    “N-no, not really.” A hesitation; that didn’t seem convincing. “He was just complaining about how immature you were being...”

                    “What a jerk! You try having someone try to steal your partner; see how mad <em>you</em> get!”

                    He shrugged again, effortlessly going along with her lie. “It is unbecoming of a celestial, whether aligned light or dark. Now, if you two are quite finished, I believe someone here needs to sit down.”

                    “?”

                    Silver grimaced, slumping onto the other side of the bench and favoring her injured leg. “How’d you notice?”

                    “Hmph.” Zeal didn’t answer.

                    Still, his intervention effectively cooled things down and before long, Lillian and Vani were on their way back to the train station. Silver declined to do anything drastic with her new knowledge, or even mention who had caused all the trouble to the police that were no doubt still investigating near downtown. Maybe if Lillian didn’t change... but she would. No doubt. Probably.

She had been so optimistic this morning, too.

                    “Sir? Someone at the door asking for you.”

                    A sigh. “I am not to be bothered for simple visitors. You know that.”

                    “She’s very mad. Says you did something to her vessel.” A pause. “Er, Vanity, sir.”

                    “Start with the name next time,” Zeal advised with a cold look. “You’ll save us both the trouble.” Then, he stood and departed from the lab.

                    “S-sorry, sir.” A pause. The figure noticed you. Crept a little closer, clutching a flat, dull-colored board to their torso. “What in the world are you...? He’s come this far in just the last few...? Are you... aware?”

                    You could reply, but Zeal had told you not to. You weren’t to reveal how advanced you were. Not to these figures, and especially not to anyone... orange-ish. This figure had a narrow band of the very same color in its orbs, darting this way and that as it took in your appearance. You would not reveal anything further.

                    “... No, I suppose not,” the figure breathed, seeming to relax. “Of course. Even he couldn’t... certainly not; not so quickly. G-good, of course...”

                    The figure departed not long after. And you quietly, sanguinely pressed one of your primary appendages to a thin, electrosensitive button left for this purpose. A nearby machine took note of your action and marked a certain timestamp for review when its master returned. In the near future, the orange-marked figure would return to the ether from which it was wrought. Obliquely; quietly; efficiently. And of course, quickly.

                    You didn’t like the orange-marked figures. Zeal had been quite clear with that directive. But you didn’t mind; how could you? That was, after all, the point.

                    ...

                    Zeal hardly had a moment in the entryway before Vanity spotted him and rushed over, finally freeing up the flustered aide she had been previously harassing. “You!” she called, flaring angrily before him. “What did you say to my vessel? She’s been all grumpy and weird and isn’t telling me whyy~!”

He would clearly rather be just about anywhere else - particularly back in the lab - but he had chosen to face her now rather than later. The more efficient method, ideally. “Perhaps it has more to do with the day’s rather distressing events than with any jibes, insults, or condolences I may have offered?”

                    “Nuh-uh! We had a nice talk about all that <em>before</em> she went all grumpy. I think you’re infectious.”

                    Zeal noted a pair of recording devices deploying near the entrance. The aide from before was taking advantage of the situation, it seemed. “You’re borderline hysterical. Why don’t you make yourself useful and test this new calming pattern developed as part of-”

                    “Get that thing away from me! I learned my lesson about your inventions a loooong~ time ago. And don’t change the subject!” she realized belatedly.

                    “Come inside, then,” he offered, gesturing to the door. “If you won’t be dissuaded.”

                    “Thank you! I won’t!”

                    He followed her into the lobby, weaving a brief, near-undetectable pattern as he went. One of his recent specialties, modeled off the strengths of his greatest opponent. Vanity didn’t <em>calm down</em>, exactly - her default state was certainly anything but - rather, she became somewhat more agreeable to his point of view. Certainly not anything as boorish as what the humans would label “mind control,” but along similar lines. He was willing to admit at least that much.

                    “Wooow~; you really decked the place out,” Vanity noted, spinning to take in the decor. “Where’s your little guy? I wanna - hold on! No, we were talking about <em>my</em> problems!”

                    “Certainly. What is your impression of the transformation undergone by your suffering vessel? Intentional on your part; hm?”

                    “I would never! You saw how sad she got; I know she wouldn’t wanna go <em>that</em> far.”

                    “So you lost control.”

                    “N-no; it was just, her emotions and she hadn’t transformed in like two weeks and her magic was all built-up and-”

                    “You lost control.”

                    “...”

He was correct, of course. The humans could only hold so much power, and being unable to convince her vessel to discharge it was a significant loss of control. Advanced practitioners like Zeal could even draw out dangerous levels of magic directly to prevent such buildups, but Vanity was an amateur. One handed a role beyond her abilities. One he could <em>use</em>. “It happens to all of us at some point. The important result is that you must learn from it.”

                    “... Like what; how to suck it out?”

                    “Of course not. You aren’t capable of such feats yet. No; observe first. What did you notice about your vessel’s animating link during the incident?”

                    A blank expression. “I was a <em>little busy</em>-”

                    He didn’t scoff, because he was a professional. “Disrupted, the entire time. Uncontrolled by you or your vessel’s core. Think: how could such a scenario prove useful?”

                    “...”

                    “Think harder. Consider our mutual enemy...?”

                    Another few seconds. Then, “I think I get it, but I don’t like~ it.”

                    “Hmph. If the core cannot control the lattice, then our enemy’s control of the core makes no difference. A simple, repeatable way to create temporary immunity to such powers.”

                    “But she’s just berserk the whole time! It doesn’t help anyone!”

                    “Control,” Zeal asserted. “With enough foresight, a mindless beast can be channeled in productive ways. Particularly one with the proper intent to produce enough power to be worth channeling.”

                    “Won’t that be really dangerous to her, though?”

                    “Vessels are designed to break. None outlast us.”

                    Zeal returned to the lab exasperated. “Honestly, that one is almost more trouble than she’s worth,” he muttered to himself, but also to you. He wouldn’t be speaking aloud if he didn’t intend for you to hear. “If she had even the slightest bit less ability to shape intent, it would be far simpler to handle her tasks myself. Yet there’s never enough time to handle <em>everything</em> on my own...”

                    You stayed quiet. If he wanted your input, he would ask for it.

                    “Regardless, let us pick up where - hm?” He noticed the flashing light on the machine, indicating you had pressed the button. “Him too, then? It’s impossible to get any reliable help these days. Fine; I’ll have him dealt with and-”

                    The sound of loud, repeated knocking on the door interrupted him. “Zeal, you massive jerk! I wasn’t done with you yet! Stop casting spells on me!”

                    Another long, drawn-out sigh. “You see what I have to work with?” he asked rhetorically, glancing in your direction. You nodded gelatinously; it seemed tough. “And yet...” A pause; he ignored the assault on his door. “Perhaps she could still be useful.”

                    Vanity stumbled through the doorway as Zeal suddenly pulled it open, nearly falling before catching herself on his shoulder. “Gah! Answer the door normally next time!”

                    He pulled her the rest of the way inside, then closed the door and carefully approached. “Stay still,” he ordered. “I need to verify your color.”

                    “You just won’t stop being rude, will you? You don’t even trust me, after all this time~?”

                    “It has been less than a year. I trust no one implicitly, much less one as unknown as yourself.” A pause; he didn’t see anything suspicious. “Face that way.”

                    “Oh my gosh it’s your little guy!” Vanity peeked down at you, taking in your appearance. And, much as the previous figure had done earlier, allowing you to examine her in turn. No orange. Not even a hint. You didn’t press the button. “Hiii~, how’re you~?”

                    “I offered her the chance to become a hero of light.”

                    “YOU WHAT?!”

                    “Calm down. It’s not as if I expect her to take the offer, not with your bond.”

                    “B-but - but you can’t be <em>sure</em>-”

                    “Hm. Could it be that you aren’t confident in your relationship with your vessel? That you worry I might steal her away?”

                    “W-well, it’s not like you’re too happy with yours right now...”

                    “I chose my latest vessel for a specific reason, and she will play that part, willingly or not. Despite what you may perceive as struggles with intent, I am certain she will still perform adequately for her required tasks.”

                    “Mr Defensive over here,” she mumbled, eyeing you sideways. There seemed to be something about your presence that made these figures want to confide in you.

                    Zeal chose to ignore her comment. “Of course, if she <em>does</em> accept the offer, I will be relying on you to apply as much guilt as possible in whatever way you choose. Ensure she changes her mind or, at minimum, that she feels she is betraying you in some manner.”

                    “That’ll be easy enough,” she grumbled, before raising her voice again. “Wait, why can’t I just be an angel instead if she wants~ to be a good guy?”

                    “The dissonance is the <em>point</em>. Think back to when we began this program in the first place. Recall why we decided to create villains at all, and why you personally became one.” He shook his head. “Honestly, with your memory, I am astonished you <em>haven’t</em> been captured yet.”

                    “Rude!” A pause. “Wait, so you just said that to make her even more sad?”

                    “The dissonance -” he repeated, as if speaking to a child. “- is the point. Crafting the proper intent to repel our enemy requires such states of mind. Heroes would be useless without villains. Now, are you quite satisfied with my answer?”

                    “I think you’re a big meanie for it.”

Now, if you wouldn’t mind <em>actually</em> leaving this time?”

                    “No, I wanna know about your little guy!” Vanity crouched next to you again, pressing up close to your enclosure. “Why’s he look like that?”

                    With a flat, almost bored tone of voice, Zeal gave up and asked, “What are you referring to, specifically?”

                    “His eyes are so glittery and humongous~!”

                    “To properly detect corruption in the facility’s staff. And certain visitors, as well.”

                    “His skin is so shiny and wet!”

                    “The air inside the enclosure is at near 100% humidity, and the specimen is lightly misted every several minutes. The skin dries too quickly and cracks apart without it. Currently, we are focusing on improvements elsewhere as the workaround is sufficient.”

                    “He’s got a... weirdly human mouth.” She poked her own face. “Not like ours.”

                    “The specimen is grown using human cells as a base culture. Most of its features inherit from the human body template, except those that we modify intentionally - or change while modifying other features.”

                    “So that’s why his nose is...?”

                    “Yes.”

                    “Kay, last question. Why’s he got that big mark on his cute, weird, kinda...blobby head?”

                    “Surely even you recognize the metzmatan.”

                    “... Oh! <em>Oh</em>, it was just - from this angle, with the skin folds and - yeah, I getcha. Hehe~, that’s pretty clever. You’re such a his-tor-iiiiaann~.”

                    “That was your last question. Leave.”

                    “Kay, byee~!” Vanity twirled to the door, her energy seemingly restored by observing your cute, weird, blobby appearance. “I’ma go tell Compy you wanna talk to herrrr~!”

                    “I do not-” The door shut. Another long sigh. “For pity’s sake. To think <em>she</em> would be critical to this effort...”

                    You burbled encouragingly. At least she had the wits to appreciate how awesome you were.

                    <em>Scene 50</em>
                    <em>July 22nd, 2028</em>

                    “Come out with your hands up, villain!” someone annoying yelled from the street. “We know you’re in there!”

                    “Don’t you two idiots have anything better to do?” Lapis shouted back, blasting another set of furniture into pieces against the far wall. “Go hunt monsters or something!”

                    “You didn’t even know I was here!” someone equally annoying interjected. “I <em>could</em> have stayed home this time!”

                    “But you didn’t.” Lapis shot a blastwave into the ceiling; it wobbled but stayed intact. Damn. She’d probably have to leave soon; even these two could probably take her on if she were trapped indoors. “Seriously, why do you even care about this place? It’s an insurance broker, for god’s sake!”

                    Some conversation outside. The first annoying person eventually responded. “It’s still a crime! Now come out or we’re coming in!”

                    Lapis rolled her eyes, broke another computer tower in half with a swing of her guitar, then hefted it over her shoulder and headed for the window. “Fine, if it makes you feel better.”

                    As expected, Strawberry and Mahogany were in their dumb little hero poses waiting for her. All cool and collected; as if. “Those hands don’t look up to me,” Mahogany commented. He already had a set of armor plates across his chest, slightly deforming his costume. And, unlike the first few times, Strawberry had learned to keep her feet on the ground - at least to start with. That had been funny, swatting her out of the air like a pesky bug. “Are you planning on resisting?”

                    “What do you think?” She leapt forward, swinging the guitar with a simple overhead motion. Just to scatter them, to start with. He went right; she went left. Lapis, landing between them, chose to go for the less-mobile Mahogany first tonight; maybe she could knock him away before Strawberry could get any of her weird magic bubbles out.

Mostly together, too, though one or the other would be absent here and there. And they were just so <em>happy</em> about it, too. It was infuriating, hardly getting to do anything without Miss Pretty Princess Sparkles and Captain I’m A Rhino Now on the case.

                    Still, it was kinda cathartic to beat them up. Strawberry was still a terrible match for Lapis; her flight powers relied on control over air, it seemed, and all the extreme vibrations Lapis could produce just wrecked that control. So she had learned to stay on or near the ground, relying on her more traditional glittery pink magic to fight. Meanwhile, Mahogany could be a better match - his ability to mutate his body meant he could temper his form to better resist sonic attacks - but he just didn’t have the airspeed to keep up with her. She had been caught a little off-guard during their first fight, not knowing what his powers were, but now she had a much better grasp and way more experience.

                    It’s not like she won every time, though. It was still two-on-one and Lapis had to retreat more than once after getting into a bad spot. But she was improving too, gaining more skill aiming at moving targets and growing her range even wider, so it was a constant back-and-forth. Havoc approved, both because their partner got to beat up heroes and because it was excellent, realistic training. Because, of course, it <em>was</em> real. It wasn’t like any of them were holding back. Certainly, Lapis hadn’t diverted Strawberry’s falling trajectory away from a heavy spike that one time. Obviously, Mahogany hadn’t held his punch a little too long to let her get away. Surely, Strawberry hadn’t left a little segment out of her net, allowing it to be broken.

                    But, whether or not there was any fun involved, their fights certainly had a rhythm. Give, take, dodge, attack. Switch targets; do it again. Like a verse in a song. Harmonious, despite the incredible capacity for violence everyone present held.

                    So, it was a real surprise to have that flow completely interrupted by a guy just sort of showing up in the middle of this one.

                    Havoc was the first to notice. Or, at least, they noticed before Lapis did, whispering an alarmed warning as she rocketed through the air. “Streetside,” they commented, voice unusually subdued. “Guy in a black t-shirt. He’s your enemy. Be <em>extremely</em> careful.”

                    Their tone was so unexpected that Lapis nearly missed her dodge, narrowly recovering to slide just barely under a lunging Mahogany. “Why be careful? Who is he?”

                    “... I don’t know. But I can sense Despair.”

                    “Another demon I don’t know? So he’s just another villain, then.”

                    “No; you don’t understand-”

                    The entire building lifted off the ground.

                    Concrete shattered; pipes broke. Wiring snapped, wood crunched, and bricks showered the street below. The entire storefront, from foundation to roof, rose up to nearly the same height as Lapis, just reaching the apex of her jump. Then, with a tremendous crash, it fell back down. Utterly demolished; not a hint remaining of what the shop had once sold.

                    She landed in the street, facing the new guy and the enormous field of rubble behind him. Mahogany slid to a stop beside her and, a moment later, Strawberry fluttered down on her other side. For once, she didn’t mind.

                    “Hey,” he said, raising a hand in a casual greeting. Strong, lean muscles. Ghostly white eyes with a hint of yellow-orange glow. “Name’s Umber. Glad that got your attention.”

                    “Too scared, huh? Boring.” He kicked a broken chunk of concrete that had recently been part of a building. With a crack like a gunshot, it disappeared into an adjacent wall, leaving a crumbling hole through solid brick. All Lapis had seen was a streaked blur. “Say something.”

                    <em>Scene 51</em>
                    “Hated that building too,” Lapis commented, since it didn’t seem like anyone else was going to. “What do you want?”

                    “That’s better,” Umber said, picking up another piece of debris and angling it in his hand to inspect all the sides. “Just wanted to get a better look at you. Know who I’m killing.”

                    “Well, it sounds like you’ve got something very important to get back to, so we’ll just be on our way and you can... um, get back to it...” Strawberry seemed very eager to leave. Given the situation, Lapis didn’t blame her for that, but she did perhaps blame her for not listening properly.

                    The stone accelerated out of his hands, breaking through the wall of a building across the street. Wind from its passage stirred up Strawberry’s hair, making it quite clear he <em>could</em> have aimed just a little to the left. “You’re the target,” he explained succinctly. “I don’t care what your friends do, but <em>you</em> aren’t leaving here alive.”

                    “M-me?” she squeaked.

                    “You,” he confirmed, reaching down for another rock. “You can fight back if you want. Don’t just stand there and take it.”

                    “Hey, what do you have against Strawberry?” Mahogany found his voice, stepping sideways to stand between them. “You’re not gonna just ‘deal with her’ like she’s some checkbox.”

                    Umber exaggerated a yawn. “Try to stop me, then.”

                    “Maybe I will.”

                    No one moved for a few seconds. Then, Umber shrugged and raised his hand a little, aiming the rock just right. At the same instant, Mahogany hurled himself backwards in a sort of reverse-armadillo whirl of chitinous plates. Strawberry was swallowed up in the wheel and the rock zipped past just overhead, demolishing a wide window across the street. The two heroes spun crazily into the entryway of a business, set back from the street and just out of view for the moment.

                    “Fine,” Umber said, starting forward and glancing briefly at Lapis as he passed. “You’re the smart one, I take it?”

                    She didn’t say anything.

Go home, then.”

                    <em>What the hell am I doing?</em> she had to ask herself. It would be so much easier to just leave, like he said. Might even make her life easier if these two got themselves killed trying to fight him. But, somehow, just running off didn’t seem appealing. Maybe it was some sense of pride. Maybe it was the knowledge that, if she did nothing tonight, he might come after her next. Or maybe she didn’t want to let the idiots get-

                    “Oh, nice of you to come back out.” Umber tapped his palm on the pavement, causing a massive slab of the stuff to break away from the road surface and float over a random pair of civilians that had happened to walk out of the same entrance the heroes had vanished into. “But too boring. Fight back next time.”

                    The pavement fell. Lapis made a snap decision.

                    A sonic blast from her guitar disrupted the already-damaged asphalt, sending it spraying onto and away from the civilians in a burst of scattered pebbles. “What are you doing?” she snapped. “You said you were after-”

                    A pause. Umber rolled his eyes, raising a much larger block of compacted soil from the now pavement-free trench. Wires snapped and several streetlights went dark. There was no way she could blast apart this thing in the same way; far too much mass.

                    “How can he tell?” the girl asked urgently, starting to run from the massive block.

                    “Don’t know; just change back! We need the powers-”

                    “But they’re <em>right here</em>-”

                    “DO IT!” the guy shouted, touching something on his wrist and becoming wreathed in light. As the block sailed towards them, too heavy for Lapis to affect and too fast for them to outrun - as the girl touched something on her head and began to glow as well - as armor plates formed and pink light created a shield around them... she understood.
                    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1357525207211835566 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1357525207211835566><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 3, 2025 9:20 PM">9:20 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The block of soil slammed into Strawberry’s shield, delivering a gargantuan amount of force. The light held for a few instants, just long enough for her to grab Mahogany and get into the air, emerging from the danger zone fast enough to avoid being flattened but not fast enough to avoid being clipped by the edge and tumbling to the street again.

                    Umber could see through their disguises.

                    “Getting better,” he nodded, running his hands along the pavement and sending another huge strip to curl up like a roll cake. “I’m almost not entirely bored.”

                    Strawberry had hit her head on something in the fall and was slow in getting up; she couldn’t fly yet. That was one of her weaknesses: her incredible air control required incredible focus. Mahogany pulled her upright, his legs starting to shift, but he wouldn’t be fast enough. Lapis knew how long it took him to change from armor to speed mode. They were about to be turned into the jelly filling of the pavement cake.

                    “Rrrghh,” she growled to herself. “This is such a bad decision.” But she made it anyway. Lapis blasted herself into the air with a chord from her guitar, arcing over the onrushing pavement roll, and landed just beside Mahogany. “Grab on!”

                    He did. She leapt. Strawberry, clinging to Mahogany in turn, barely cleared the top of the roll as the three of them landed awkwardly on the somehow still-intact roof of a fast food restaurant just next door. The roll stopped; Umber looked up. “Not as smart as you seemed earlier, huh. Go ahead, then. Try to stop me.”

                    “Maybe I will.” To Mahogany and the slowly-recovering Strawberry, she muttered, “You two had better be worth it.” Then, without waiting for a response, she did what none of them had tried yet. She attacked.

                    <em>Scene 52</em>
                    A heavy blast of sound drove cracks into the pavement around Umber, shaking it apart and causing him to drop an inch or so as the ground sank. But <em>he</em> just stood there. Casually, hands in his pockets, watching her play as he simply wasn’t affected whatsoever.

                    Lapis stopped, more worried than she’d admit to anyone. Umber shook his head, stepping out of the section of broken road. “You’ll have to do better than that.”

                    “How’s he doing that?” Mahogany muttered, stepping up beside her on the roof.

                    “Dunno, but you better help distract him if you’re just gonna stay here. Try something else!”

                    “But he’s after her-” He nodded behind them. “I’ve gotta help-”

                    “I’m okay,” Strawberry assured them, taking a few steps forward. “But we need to get out of here.”

                    “Not if he can just snipe us with a rock from a block away.”

                    “Smokescreen? So he can’t see anything?”

                    “... Worth a try.”

                    A loud crack; the building jolted. “Hey, what are you talking about up there?” Umber asked as the entire restaurant lifted into the air. Its outer edges began to crinkle inwards, starting to crumple the whole thing up like a discarded wad of paper.

                    “Go find something to do that!” Lapis yelled as she blasted off to the side; Strawberry lifted Mahogany into the air in the other direction. “I’ll see if anything works on him!”

                    She had no intention of fighting him directly. The guy who could turn an ordinary rock into a railgun projectile? Roll up pavement like paper? Crunch entire buildings? No thank you. But Lapis had a feeling he wouldn’t just go away even if they did manage to escape this time; she needed to know what could actually stand a chance of hurting him.

                    “Havoc?”

                    “Here.” They materialized next to her, shaped long and sleek against the wind.

                    “Help me out here.” Lapis rarely asked for help directly, but here... “Who’s Despair? What can they do?”

                    “Used to be a demon. Now worse. He’s channeling near-unlimited strength into his partner.”

Again, unaffected. He tapped a streetlight, having it rip from the ground and arrow towards her like a missile. A near miss; she spun through the air from the turbulence and narrowly recovered. Mahogany and Strawberry were out of sight somewhere; they’d better not just be running away.

                    “How can I stop him? My attacks don’t work.”

                    “I can tell he’s reacting to your attacks when they arrive; he’s <em>blocking</em> them, not just doing nothing. I don’t know how, exactly, but you would have an effect if he didn’t or couldn’t.”

                    “Surprise attack or overwhelm him,” Lapis translated. “Maybe we’ll try that with the smokescreen.”

                    “Be careful. He may have additional senses.”

                    “Great. You’re gonna have to tell me why this chump’s so strong later.”

                    “As much as I can.”

                    Lapis angled towards the ground, landing in a two-note tone and a cloud of dust from all the broken pavement. The city would have a hell of a time cleaning this up later. “You’re a kinda lousy shot,” she called towards Umber, still standing near the demolished fast food restaurant. “All your flashy power doesn’t do anything if you can’t hit anyone with it.”

                    He shrugged. “It would be boring to just kill everyone instantly. You want to see the proof, then?”

                    “Not really.” She spotted Strawberry arcing behind another building, carrying a net of several large bags. Out of Umber’s view, since he was facing Lapis. “Just making conversation.”

                    Another shrug. He knelt to slap the ground, causing a huge tremor. Lapis launched back into the air instantly, avoiding a sudden chasm by a second. And, as suddenly as it formed, the crevice slammed back together again; it would have utterly crushed her if she had been much slower.

The <em>crack</em> hit her ears an instant later; Umber vaguely smiled, lowering his hand. He had held a pebble in his offhand, waiting for her to jump before releasing it at damn near supersonic speeds. Blood and scraps of shredded flesh sprayed into the night. She lurched in midair, concentration broken by pain, and landed badly just across the street. A huge hole in her leg let blood pool in the street. She wouldn’t be able to walk, let alone jump. Hell, if she were a regular person, this much bleeding would be fatal in minutes. Even for her...

                    “See?” Umber stalked closer, now smiling just a little more obviously. “It gets boring if it’s over too quick.” A pause as he moved closer. “Although, there is an allure in this part, too...”

                    Havoc fluttered impotently overhead; they couldn’t fight Umber any more than she could. And she could hardly keep her battle form together at the moment; actually getting up was beyond her current abilities. But maybe... “...ck yo...” she whispered, imbuing her voice with a bit of power from her guitar as it dissolved back into her main body.

                    The ground beneath his feet trembled, but Umber himself was unaffected yet again. “Awfully one note,” he commented. “Boring.”

                    And then the air exploded.

A heavy metallic <em>clang</em> resonated somewhere nearby, followed by a harsh, unpleasant-sounding crunch. Then a soft breeze from above and a low hum as someone pink and annoying bundled Lapis into a net for flight. Finally, a much louder pink firework exploded overhead, the scuffling sounds from nearby stopped, and as Strawberry lifted off the ground, Mahogany leapt up to grab onto her. His wings expanded to reduce her workload and they pushed into the sky, leaving behind a cloud of dust and an opponent that definitely could not, under any circumstances, possibly be able to aim after them.

                    Lapis passed out.

                    <em>Scene 53</em>
                    <em>July 23rd, 2028</em>

                    Anya slowly woke up. Her leg ached. Her head hurt. Her mouth was dry, her fingers tingled with mild pins and needles, and she generally felt like she shouldn’t be alive.

                    Good start. She opened her eyes.

                    She was lying in a plush, pastel pink bed within a traditionally girly bedroom. Something was bound tightly around her right thigh, where she had been shot, and she wasn’t transformed anymore. Bright sunlight filtered in through the blinds; it was obviously well into morning or even later. She’d been out for a while.

                    Soft, even breathing caught her attention just to her right. She carefully turned her head just enough to look in that direction.

                    Strawberry sat in a desk chair beside the bed, head drooping to one side and obviously fast asleep. Only, this wasn’t Strawberry, exactly. She looked very similar, but this wasn’t her battle form. She was wearing a simple grey smock or extra-long shirt or something, with evidence of hastily-cleaned blood staining her fingers and clothing. An open first-aid kit sat in disarray on the nightstand just beside her.

                    “...” Clearly, she owed Miss Pretty Princess for saving her life. Even if she hadn’t bled out then and there, Umber certainly would have finished the job without her being airlifted to safety. Although...

                    Anya scanned the rest of the room. Mahogany wasn’t there. That was either good or bad, but it certainly wasn’t neutral.

                    Well, there was one way to find out what had happened most quickly. She opened her mouth to ask what was going on, but instead just coughed with her dry throat. It did the job anyway; not-Strawberry stirred and quickly noticed Anya was awake.

                    “Oh, gosh! H-hi; good morning! I must’ve fallen asleep... How are you feeling?”
                    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1359340039674400959 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1359340039674400959><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 8, 2025 9:32 PM">9:32 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Bad,” she answered succinctly, after another few coughs. Not-Strawberry looked around to find a water bottle, which she offered. “But better than dead.” Anya took the water, muttering “Thanks” at the same time. Maybe she meant for rescuing her; maybe just for the water. Not-Strawberry didn’t have to know.

                    A nod, an uneasy smile. “I tried to bandage up your leg and I don’t think it was bleeding <em>that</em> much anymore, but it probably still hurts a lot... Sorry; I don’t have any ‘real’ healing magic.”

                    “Like I said, not dead’s better than I expected.” The water helped a lot; she felt like one of those “just add water” TV things that was starting to come back to life. “How’d you and Idiot #2 fare?”

                    “Oh, I’m okay! I just dislocated my shoulders, but-”

                    “Both of them?”

                    “Yep! But it’s okay; Hugo put them back in. I can almost lift them over my head again already!” She demonstrated briefly, struggling to reach her ears. “It happened when he got shot too, so I almost dropped everyone and it was a bit of a jolt. O-or at least I think that’s when it happened; everything was going so fast...”

                    “That’s his name, then? Hugo?”

                    “Oh, y-yes! And, I’m really sorry, but, um, you changed back while we were flying and I kinda... totally saw it happen. S-so...”

                    “It’s fine. I expected that after waking up here.”

                    “Y-yeah... I probably wouldn’t have just brought back a normal civilian to my house, huh...”

                    “...” A few moments passed. “This is the part when you tell me your name,” Anya clarified.

                    “Oh! I’m Yumi,” not-Strawberry said, finally claiming a name beyond “not-Strawberry.” “And, er, did you want to tell me-”

                    “Anya. Surprised you didn’t just check my ID.”

                    “Wha-?”

                    “In my pocket? When you - where are my pants, if you don’t know what-”

                    “Oh! Sorry, sorry! That just didn’t occur - I mean, looking through someone else’s stuff without permission?” A pause. “T-they’re in the laundry, ‘cause of all the blood...”

                    “Right.” Another pause. “So, where is he?”

He’s okay! I mean, he was really hurt, but with his magic... erm... maybe I can just tell you what happened? What’s the last thing you remember?”

                    “A big pink firework and you picking me up in a net.”

                    “Okay, okay... so, right after that...”

                    ...
                    <em>July 22nd, 2028 (again)</em>

                    Strawberry strained her magic to its limits, pushing through the air as fast as she could while carrying two passengers. Mahogany was helping a little with his wings, but he could only make them more aerodynamic and better at gliding; he couldn’t add much <em>power</em>. “Bank left!” she yelled over the wind. “I’m gonna get us behind some buildings!” The smokescreen wouldn’t last forever and there was always the dual risks that Umber could see through it somehow... or just walk out of it. Either way, they needed better cover.

                    Their flight changed course as Mahogany shifted his wings and Strawberry turned with him. Smoother, but not as fast as she could do on her own.

                    A tiny glint in the far distance became a very close glint before she could react. There was an explosion of blood and gore, something the size of a telephone pole clipped her net arm, and both Mahogany and Lapis slipped from her grasp as her magic faltered. Then, a rattling <em>boom</em>.

                    They fell; Strawberry dived. Somehow, pushing herself further than she ever had, she managed to weave a new net and catch both of them. But too close to the ground; she banked sharply up, the net’s elasticity cushioning her friends against the sudden change in direction but not doing nearly as much for her arms. Brutal, tearing pain; she couldn’t maintain the angle and lowered it. Less strain; she managed.
                    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1359340164274454721 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1359340164274454721><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 8, 2025 9:32 PM">9:32 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>A bit of a lapse. She flew almost aimlessly for a while, just trying to get distance from the human(?) railgun known as Umber. For a time, she didn’t even know if her passengers were alive or if she was just carrying a net of corpses. At some point, she landed on a roof and bound tight shields of pink energy around the bloodiest holes to try and keep as much inside as she could.

                    But then Mahogany stirred, recovering enough to stem his own bleeding by shifting around flesh to cover the missing portions. He had lost an entire leg, part of his pelvis, and a chunk of his torso. No way he could fully recover right now, but it would do to keep him alive for now. That lifted enough strain off Strawberry that she could properly, though temporarily, seal Lapis’ leg wound almost completely, preventing any more bleeding until they could do something more permanent.

                    Then: hospital or somewhere else? Strawberry wanted to get them to real doctors, but Mahogany convinced her it wouldn’t be safe. They wouldn’t be able to hide their identities properly and who knew how much surveillance Umber had? They needed to hide somewhere and recover for a while, as long as no one was in imminent danger of death.

                    After popping her arms back into place with a minimum of screaming, Strawberry pointed out that Lapis was in fact in such danger. At least, she was until Mahogany managed to perform a blood transfusion with his powers.

                    <em>July 23rd, 2028 (again)</em>

                    “He what? How?!”

                    Strawberry winced, wiggling her hand noncommittally. “He can change the type of blood if he touches it, I guess? It really hurt and was really gross and I don’t wanna talk about it.”

                    “... Your blood, then. Not his.”

                    “Well he didn’t have enough left! He didn’t have a <em>leg</em> at the time! I mean, it’s super crazy he was even <em>awake!</em> Of course it was my blood; I was the only one who still had any left!”

                    “Right.” A pause. “Thanks, again.”

                    <em>Scene 54</em>
                    There wasn’t actually all that more to tell. Strawberry brought everyone back here, they did their best to get Anya stable, and then Mahogany left to regrow his leg (a process that he warned was “messy and fragile,” and thus not one he wanted to undergo in less-than-ideal circumstances).

                    “So that’s what happened,” Yumi concluded. “But we still don’t really know anything about this Umber guy or what he wants or how he’s so strong. I was gonna ask Compy, but I was... a little busy last night.”

                    “Yeah, we gotta know what’s going on.” Anya pushed herself a little further towards a sitting position, trying to ignore the powerful ache in her leg. “Havoc, you there?”

                    “Yes,” they said, fading out of some shadows above the window. “I did mention something about that yesterday.”

                    “Tell her too.” Anya gestured to Yumi. “Like it or not, we’re gonna have to work with her and the other one, whenever he’s done regenerating.”

                    “... Very well.” Havoc didn’t make any obvious motion, but Yumi blinked and looked up a little; she could clearly see them now. “As I said, Despair is his partner. A demon at one point, now he has devolved into something worse.” A breath. “He-”

                    A second celestial materialized out of beams of light from the window. Compassion tackled Havoc, sending them both tumbling into the ceiling like a pair of angry, flying, wrestling cats.

                    “Hey! Whoa! What are you - they’re trying to help us!” Yumi called, standing quickly and reaching up as if she could knock them down. No luck; too short. Maybe if she jumped. “Stop it!”

                    “I’ve never seen an angel and a demon actually fight before,” Anya mused calmly. “Didn’t even know they could touch each other.”

                    “Get off the ceiling!”

                    They both vanished.

                    “...”

                    “I guess they’re off the ceiling.”

                    “I didn’t mean like that! Compy? You still around?”

                    No response. Havoc didn’t return either. “Did your partner know you were gonna bring us here? That why she’s so mad?”

She knew. Compy usually likes team-ups; she’s all about friendship and working together! I bet it was about something your demon was about to say.”

                    “What, telling us what Despair is now? A ‘worse demon?’”

                    “I guess?” Yumi sat down again, huffy. “Maybe it was a lie and she got all mad about it!”

                    “You think that guy <em>wasn’t</em> being powered by something worse than a demon?”

                    “Well...”

                    “Bet it’s some big secret that your angel’s too much of a prude to tell us.”

                    “She wouldn’t do that! Besides, angels and demons have different secrets.”

                    “You really believe it when they say they’re that different? I mean, they look damn near identical and do the same damn things. The only difference is what they want their partners to do.”

                    “That’s different enough! I bet it’s one of those things where they were one big happy kingdom, then some rebels stole some magic, and those were the demons, and the angels are trying to bring them back, and if they just can work out their differences...”

                    “Sounds like it’s one of those things where you watch too much <em>Tales from Zycocia</em>.”

                    “I do not! Wait, how did you know what that’s-”

                    The two celestials reappeared at around this point, drifting back down to eye level and saving Anya from having to answer that question. Compassion was the first to speak. “Despair is a very powerful demon who bears a particular grudge against me - and thus my partner.”

                    “He is capable of channeling incomparable amounts of power into his partner, allowing for incredible feats,” Havoc continued, not showing any signs of having just been tackled by the angel next to them a minute prior. “As you have seen.”

                    “There will be more of these incredibly powerful demons arriving soon. We have reason to believe they are targeting heroes-”

                    “-And villains,” Havoc interrupted.

                    “Heroes of light <em>and</em> dark,” Compassion agreed. “Those who hold abilities or circumstances that could threaten their dominance.”

                    “So we’ll work together. Despair must be stopped and ideally destroyed. Conveniently, we already know he’s scared of you-” A paw-point to Yumi. “-because he chose to target you first.”

                    “Umber is not invincible. He is powerful and has quick reactions, but if taken by surprise or somehow prevented from defending against your attacks, he can be brought down,” Havoc echoed their words from last night.

                    “And when that happens, we can use the connection to Despair to force him to manifest.”

                    “And to be destroyed.”

                    That seemed to be the end of the two celestials’ presentation. “Confident?” Compassion asked, fluttering back towards Yumi. “You get to fight alongside your friends!”

                    “Questions?” Havoc asked instead, noting Anya’s expression. And Yumi’s, actually. Neither seemed to be fully satisfied with the explanation. And that was because, of course...

                    <em>Scene 55</em>
                    A pause. Anya was about to say something, but Yumi got there first. “If you guys agree on all this, why were you fighting like two seconds ago?”

                    “I don’t remember any fighting,” Compassion said innocently. Havoc shrugged in either agreement or disinterest.

                    “No, you can’t just say that didn’t happen; everyone saw it! Right?” She looked over at Anya, who nod-shrugged in agreement. “Right. Do you two get along or not? I - I mean, I’d kinda get it if you didn’t, but since we’re supposed to be teaming up and all...”

                    “I don’t hold any grudges against them. Only Despair... and maybe a few others,” she assured. Havoc shrugged again in a near-identical way.

                    “Then why did you just - okay, whatever. You’re gonna tell me this is all part of the ‘hero experience,’ aren’t you?”

                    “Who can say?”

                    <em>“You can!”</em>

                    “Yeah, they’re not gonna tell us,” Anya spoke up. “Think of it like a trust thing, if it makes you feel better.”

                    “It doesn’t!”

                    “Then don’t.” A breath. “Hey, anyway, your big team-up plan has a giant flaw.” Both celestials turned their attention to her. Anya pointed at her leg, still under the covers. “I don’t know if you were paying attention, but we got fuckin’ steamrolled last night. Didn’t stand a chance. And, I know this is gonna heal faster than usual, but I still can’t, like, walk for weeks probably. Let alone jump around or fly or, y’know, <em>fight.</em> Point is, you’re both nuts if you think we’re gonna be able to do jack about this guy, even <em>if</em> we do all your fancy power-of-friendship team-up magic. It’s not happening.”

                    “... I didn’t want to say anything, but I don’t think I can fly for a while either,” Yumi admitted. “I think I got hurt the least, but it was still a lot...”

APPARENTLY he can just GROW IT BACK but the point stands. It’s gonna be weeks at least before we could even think about fightin’ him again, and I don’t see it going any better in round 2 without a hell of a plan or a lot of backup.” A pause; she thought of something else. “<em>Also</em>, he’s not just gonna sit around that long. If he’s after her for whatever reason, he’s gonna try and find her again. And - hey, one more thing: how’d he see through those disguises? Even you two can’t do that.”

                    Having provided too much to respond to in a single rant, Havoc decided to focus on just the last question. “The anti-recognition enchantment is extremely powerful, but it is <em>only</em> extremely powerful - not categorically unbreakable. Despair must have devoted a significant portion of his new power to piercing the enchantment.”

                    “Who else can do it, then?”

                    “Others of similar strength.”

                    “Okay, we’re gonna need more info on these ‘worse than a demon’s,” Anya decided. “Why are they showing up now? How did they become ‘worse?’ What does that even mean?”

                    “Can angels be that powerful too?” Yumi chimed in. “Maybe they can help us?”

                    The celestials looked at each other. “One moment, please.” They both vanished again.

                    Anya rolled her eyes in a vaguely Yumi-wards direction. “You think they might be <em>hiding</em> something from us?”

                    “It’s SO ANNOYING!” she exclaimed in response. “How do they expect us to help with anything if they don’t TELL US WHAT’S GOING ON!” She yelled that last part in the direction the celestials had vanished, but neither one reappeared.

                    “Fine. Let’s think about it. Did anything big happen lately that could change things?”

                    “Um... I dunno; I don’t think there’s anything, like, <em>globally</em> huge...”

                    “You think this is happening worldwide?”

                    “Maybe? Why would it just be here?”

                    “Maybe something happened here.”

                    “There was that big snake, I guess, but it didn’t seem <em>that</em> big...”

No one important’s died recently... Haven’t heard of any new crazy heroes... They wouldn’t care about politics and the election’s not for months anyway...”

                    They thought about it for a while, but didn’t come up with anything that seemed important. Eventually, the celestials reappeared.

                    “The timing is mostly a coincidence,” Havoc began.

                    “A latent corrupting force that has slowly been growing more tempting over years,” Compassion clarified. “Recently, certain demons have begun giving into greed.”

                    “Angels are not immune either,” Havoc pointed out. “Their greed takes a different form, but they are no less dangerous because of it.”

                    “Those who have fallen to temptation cannot be relied upon in a fight against it.”

                    “Those who have not remain at a disadvantage against those who have. It would be possible to gain such powers ourselves, for instance-”

                    “-but to give in would mean defeat regardless.”

                    “It’s really weird when you two finish each other’s sentences,” Anya interrupted. “I mean, you just met.”

                    “Our enemies maintain the same form of powers that we possess,” Havoc continued without acknowledging her comment. “The change is merely in scale.”

                    “But a change of scale can become a change in form, if the difference is severe enough.”

                    A pause; it seemed like they were done. “So what is the ‘force’ you’re talking about?” Yumi asked. “What is it that’s so tempting?”

                    “Power beyond what is agreed,” Compassion said. “Outsized influence over the affairs of humans. There is a reason why we tend to affect the world only through the actions of our partners, you know.”

                    “And that reason is?”

                    “Who can say?”

                    Yumi just sighed. The answer to that particular question was at the heart of the biggest mystery of all: what all these celestials were doing on earth in the first place and why they had started choosing heroes and villains. She’d asked it a few hundred times by now, probably. “Worth a try.”

If it’s just getting more tempting, like you said.”

                    Again, the mysterious “Who can say?”

                    “Yeah, see, the problem is that <em>this time</em>, I actually believe you don’t know.”

                    <em>July 26th, 2028</em>

                    “So that’s what happened, basically,” Mahogany concluded, leaning back to lie on the grass. “Anyway, crazy that we both hurt our legs again like, three days apart. Oh, and Lapis too.”

                    “I don’t think mine is really on the same level as yours...” Silver disagreed, gesturing vaguely at her kinda-achey but still perfectly normal-looking leg compared to his... well. It was <em>there</em>, but way thinner than usual. He was hiding it with an extra pair of trousers over his normal hero outfit, though she could still tell how much mass was missing from how the fabric folded around it.

                    “‘Nother few days and I’ll be all good again! Just gotta keep up with my diet!”

                    “Right.” This was, ostensibly, why he had brought her out to the park again: more hot dogs to turn into more leg meat. “Wait, you’re not going to distract me. I kinda thought Strawberry was exaggerating, honestly. But, um, she definitely wasn’t.”

                    “Nope! If anything, she toned it down a bit.”

                    “So, what did you actually want <em>me</em> to do?” That was the big question. Strawberry had sent her a hard-to-follow and very hyper summary of what had happened, but now that Mahogany had filled in the details, it was pretty obvious that- “There’s no way I can do anything to him either, even if I tried reflecting his, um, bullets. There’s a limit to how much force I can do, you know; his railgun thing would just go right through me.”

                    “Really? But you could, like, bounce yourself off the ground from hundreds of feet in the air. I bet that’s tons more energy than in a little chunk of rock going at mach 1!”

                    “I don’t think that’s true...”

                    “Well, isn’t energy - wait, you said force. Is that a different thing? Do your powers work on force or energy?”

I don’t know if I really want to think about it too much.”

                    “Hmm... couldn’t that be a good change though? One that can help you bounce railgun bullets around?”

                    “I really don’t know if it’s going to work that way...”

                    “Here! Have this rock.”

                    She took the rock.

                    “How much heavier do you think you are than it?”

                    “...?”

                    “I mean, it’s not a one-pound rock, so probably at <em>least</em> a hundred times, right? Unless you’re like a feather or something.”

                    “I guess? What does this have to do with-”

                    “And you fell off that eel and were totally fine! How fast d’you think that was?”

                    “Er... pretty fast?”

                    “Like, faster than a car?”

                    “Maybe?”

                    “Okay, maybe like 70mph then; that’s pretty fast.”

                    “Was I really falling that fast?” Silver muttered to herself, but Mahogany kept going anyway.

                    “So, like, if you’re a hundred times heavier than this rock and you can catch yourself at <em>at least</em> 70mph, then that means you can catch this rock at... uh... seven <em>thousand</em> miles per hour.”

                    “That’s like ten times the speed of sound.”

                    “So you’re totally fine, right? I think he was chuckin’ rocks around fast enough to make some sonic booms, but probably not that much faster! I bet it wasn’t ten <em>times</em> faster!”

                    Silver wasn’t entirely convinced his math was accurate, but she decided to go for the more obvious flaw instead of trying to remember what <em>exactly</em> the difference was between force and momentum. “What if he throws something bigger than a rock? Like, even <em>if</em> you’re right, if he throws something bigger than me, it’d have to be going kinda slow to even have a chance of reflecting it.”

                    “Well, the bigger stuff is easier to see coming and dodge out of the way...”

                    “You just said he got you from a few blocks away!”

                    “Look,” Mahogany said suddenly, sitting up a bit. “I know it’s gonna be dangerous, but I really think you’re about the best hero around for dealin’ with his - I mean, it’s basically just a gun with the little stuff.

Plus, all three of us lived through the fight and we didn’t even know what he could do at first! I’m not askin’ you to take him on yourself; I’m just askin’ that you help us out a bit.”

                    “... That’s a little better.”

                    “I didn’t <em>exactly</em> say that...”

                    “So you’re <em>not</em> gonna help?”

                    “Well, pick one or the other,” Mahogany said with a little huff. “But between you and me, you should pick the ‘help us’ option.”

                    “I mean, I’m not saying I won’t help; it’s just... fighting him directly is a bit...” She mumbled something indistinctly. “Just, maybe give me a bit more time to think about what I can actually do without just getting turned into a fine powder?”

                    “I mean, you got about as long as it takes me to grow this sucker back-” His leg, he indicated. “-plus for the other two to get better too. But even before that, I wanna get plannin’ to make sure it goes better the second time.” A pause. “Don’t you wanna be part of the biggest superhero team-up for probably years? Granite’s on board too, and I’m talkin’ to some other guys I used to know in another group. I bet it’d even be safer with all these friends and allies and stuff than on your own, right?”

                    “I didn’t say no!” she repeated. “I just - I need some time to think, okay? Plus,” she realized, looking down at the phone she had gotten used to summoning in her battle form, “I’ve gotta go now anyway. I didn’t have <em>that</em> long to talk.”

                    “Aw, you’re ditching me?”

                    “No, I really already had something else planned. I mean, you just texted me like an hour ago and I just happened to be going near here anyway?”

                    “Ditching,” he sighed, though not seriously. “Alright, see ya around. And hopefully see ya reflecting a pebble right into that guy’s smug face.”

                    “I’ll think about it.”

It was a little weird how hesitant she was being about this, but something about this Umber guy just seemed like really bad news. Well, besides the obviously-bad-news part of his absurd powers and ability to win against three fairly powerful heroes at once. No, what really threw her off wasn’t just the extreme danger, though that didn’t help. Her battle form had resistance to that sort of thing; she vaguely understood how differently her emotions worked when transformed by now.

                    What <em>really</em> threw her off was how Zeal was acting.

                    Usually, he would let her blunder into problems without providing much in the way of guidance. Sure, he would usually have some alternate plan in place if she <em>really</em> got in trouble - by now, she was fairly certain he had contacted Mahogany and Justice that one time she had nearly gotten eaten by the arms monster - but it was rare for him to actually recommend or discourage a particular course of action.

                    But he had actually said “no” when she asked about fighting Umber, back when all she had to go on was Strawberry’s summary. And, even more unusually, he had clarified a little. “Your match-up against him could be no worse, even with many more months of practice. Though it might seem that your ability is a reasonable counter to his, the very instant he determines how it works and what <em>precisely</em> you can do, defeat will be inevitable. Your path must avoid him, for now.”

                    Of course she had asked why, what it <em>was</em> that she could do, how long “for now” would last, and so on, but predictably got nowhere. Typical Zeal stuff. But for just a little while, he had seemed truly serious.

                    Bria climbed up the stairs to the platform, checking the time. She was a little late, but so was the train, so it balanced out. A peek down the tracks didn’t immediately reveal her ride, so she found a relatively clean bit of wall to lean against while surveying the crowd.

Mahogany had told her that Umber could see through disguises, and although her base form did had different hair and eye colors than her battle form, it wouldn’t be impossible to guess who she was if you didn’t have to deal with the anti-recognition enchantment. She had been photographed before while in her battle form; there had been news articles. She even had a wiki page on that one site that obsessively catalogued information about heroes and villains, which was always weird to think about.

                    The point was, she certainly wouldn’t be anonymous if it weren’t for that enchantment, so she kept an eye out for anyone who looked like Umber. Unfortunately, <em>Bria</em> couldn’t see through disguises, so if he was in his normal form, she’d look straight past him even if he were right there. And if he <em>were</em> right there and could tell who she was... it would be very easy to sneak away, transform, and kill her before she could react. As far as she knew, he wasn’t after her specifically, but still...

                    Not a happy thought.

                    The train pulled to a stop and she got on board, glancing warily at all the muscular guys around. There weren’t any more than normal, but any of them could be him. Maybe. It would only be a few stops. Maybe she should have just bounced there. But that would have required jumping off a building or something first, and the momentum would be mostly back up rather than sideways...

                    Wait, there was a muscular guy standing over there, absorbed in something on his phone. Wearing, like, most of a suit but with the jacket slung over his shoulder instead of put on? Maybe cause of the heat. But why wasn’t he sitting down? Maybe cause there weren’t any available seats, actually. Plus, Umber didn’t seem like the kind of person to wear a suit... unless it was the perfect disguise!

                    ... She probably wouldn’t even be able to think of his base form as suspicious, even if she did find him. The enchantment was <em>really</em> strong.

                    <em>Scene 58</em>
                    Bria was able to realize how ridiculous she was being before the next stop and looked away from the almost certainly innocent man. Honestly, she couldn’t just decide random people looked a little bit like she assumed Umber probably did (she hadn’t actually met him or seen any photos) and use that as an excuse to stalk them. If he showed up, she’d deal with it then. There wasn’t really much else she could do... aside from maybe joining up with whatever effort Mahogany and co were putting together. But with what Zeal said...

                    Every so often, Bria wondered why she had decided to accept Zeal’s offer way back then. Or, actually, it had been less than two months but it sure felt longer. Being a hero was very stressful, took up a lot of time, and carried a lot more risks than she had initially thought. There were still the ideals of justice and helping save people from monsters and stuff, but outside of when she was <em>actually</em> fighting monsters, those ideals (and the motivation they provided) felt a little more abstract than she might prefer.

                    Oop, this was her stop. Squeeze out through the crowd, descend into the hot, sunny streets below. She didn’t have far to go; her destination was, funny enough, another park. This one was just closer to the lake. Probably packed with people given the weather, although at least it wasn’t a weekend.

                    After a bit of walking, she found exactly who she was looking for at exactly the agreed-upon meeting place. “Hey, Lillian,” she said, lifting a hand in a little wave. “Sorry I’m a bit late; I - um, you good?”

                    “Are you talking to me? Do we know each other?”
                    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1363251781488087292 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1363251781488087292><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, April 19, 2025 4:35 PM">4:35 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Yeah, of course we do,” Bria almost said, before realizing what the problem was. “A-ah; sorry. I thought you were someone else...” She hurried off to get out of sight before Lillian could ask any more questions, like how she knew her name. Because, of course, she’d never met <em>Bria</em> - only <em>Silver.</em> At least she knew the disguises still worked on <em>almost</em> everyone.

                    One quick transformation later and she returned from a different direction in the proper form this time. “Hi; sorry I’m late,” she paraphrased her earlier words. “Ran into someone else and he had a lot to talk about. How, um, are you?”

                    “... Not great,” she admitted. “I - okay, do you... I’m just going to get right into it - do you remember last week when you, um... all ‘that’ happened?”

                    “Yeah...?” Relieved she didn’t seem to be bringing up her identity mistake a few minutes ago, Silver sat down in the shade. Nice breeze. Lillian hadn’t actually told her what this was about, just that she needed some advice.

                    “You know how there was that argument about whether I should... quit?”

                    “Yeah?”

                    “Well...” She looked around; there was a group of three people slowly making their way up the nearest path. “Just a minute...”

                    Silver got it quickly. “I think if you stand over here behind the tree, you’re probably out of view? It’s a pain, isn’t it?”

                    “Yeah.”

                    It took another half-minute or so, but eventually Lillian was satisfied no one was watching and transformed. Silver wasn’t really sure what she should expect - clearly, by transforming, it was obvious that Lillian hadn’t quit. But if she was just turning back into her regular battle form, that wouldn’t be a surprise either. Maybe it had changed? Zeal did say something about the “vision that lies within your heart” influencing how it looked, and that it could change over time. Maybe she had those weird black streamers built-in now? Silver certainly wouldn’t have much advice if <em>that</em> were the case.

                    Violet(?)’s outfit was roughly the same shape and style, but its coloring was much lighter - more of a pale purple than a deep near-black. A lot of the belts and chains and stuff had been replaced by lace and ribbons and extra bits of smooth fabric. The translucent black cloak was now more of a silky, gossamer kinda texture, scattering light into prism-like colors from certain angles. She spread her arms like “ta-da.”

                    “Whoa. What changed? I mean, you didn’t quit or you wouldn’t be transformed. How did you change your battle form so quickly? Zeal told me it was really hard.”

                    “He didn’t tell you what I did?”

                    “He doesn’t tell me anything! Mostly. Also, why would he know?”

                    “I <em>did</em> quit,” Violet(?) declared. “But not being a hero entirely. Just... being a dark one.”

                    “... You’re a hero of light now?!” Silver deduced. “You can <em>do</em> that?!”

                    “I guess so.”

                    “I - I mean, that’s great! Good for you; now you can be a hero but also help people instead of hurting! How did it work? Did you need to do the weird dissolve-y thing again? Did you meet an angel to be your new partner? Did-”

                    “No!” she exclaimed, somehow seeming more vulnerable in this new outfit than even her base form. “I - I had to... Vani had to leave, because she’s not an angel, and that was hard enough, but now... there’s no angel! Zeal said there would be, but no one’s here and I don’t know why or even <em>how</em> I can still do magic without one, but I just - if you don’t know, can you at least ask him what I need to do?”

                    “... You don’t have an angel? How did you-”

                    “I don’t know! I don’t know how any of this works! I’m just trying to do the right thing and it’s all going wrong!”

                    “Okay, okay; I can help.” Silver looked around, but predictably didn’t see Zeal anywhere. “Zeal?” she asked the air anyway, in case he was invisible. “Need your help right now. Are you around?”

                    “It doesn’t seem like it,” Silver admitted cautiously. “But I’m sure he’ll turn up eventually. It’s really rare he leaves me alone for an entire day.”

                    “How long do you think...? I have to get back home in a few hours.”

                    “I don’t know; maybe soon? Maybe not?” She sighed. “He’s unpredictable.”

                    “...”

                    Silver considered alternatives. “I do know some other heroes,” she mentioned. “I was actually just talking to someone else like half an hour ago; we could see if any other angels would be able to help?”

                    “... As long as it’s not that pink-haired girl,” Lillian said. “I don’t think she’d be happy after what I did.” Another pause. “Plus, I don’t know if I’d want to tell just some random hero about everything that’s going on; it’s a little much.”

                    Right, Strawberry. Silver had been thinking of Mahogany, since she had just talked to him, but he was friends with “the pink-haired girl” and he did like to gossip a lot. Could she trust him to keep something like this a secret? Maybe if she asked to just talk to Justice alone, and Mahogany went somewhere else? No, that’d be weird and he’d be too curious afterwards. Plus, Lillian was right; this whole situation would be a bit much to try and dump on someone else who didn’t already know what was going on. Maybe it’d be okay, but everyone was already busy and on edge with all these other problems, like Umber. Adding another weird thing to the pile...

                    “You might be right,” she agreed. “I can hang out with you until Zeal shows up or you have to go, though. If you’ve got some time, it’s pretty possible he’ll stop by just to complain at me or something.”

                    “It doesn’t sound like you get along all that well,” Lillian noted.

A lot of the time, actually. He never tells me anything important, he’s never around when I need him (like now!), we don’t agree on how to fight monsters (or villains!), and he’s just really preachy about the ‘right way’ to do things?” A pause. “But it’s not like he’s just a massive jerk all the time. I’m pretty sure he’s pulling strings behind the scenes to make sure I don’t get into <em>too</em> much trouble, even if he doesn’t want to admit it, and he does give some useful advice about my powers and... important stuff. Plus, I think I’d hate it more to be micromanaged than left on my own.”

                    “... Yeah.”

                    Ah, right. Her parents. Silver almost tried to change topics by asking about Lillian’s relationship with her angel, but was thankfully able to remember how this whole conversation started before screwing up <em>that</em> badly. “If, er, when we get this figured out and you get to be a full hero of light, what did you want to do with that power? I - I mean, why did you decide to change sides at all? Or, instead of just quitting entirely?”

                    That question didn’t seem to go over very well either, Silver observed. Whoops. “I don’t know,” Lillian said sullenly. “I guess I just didn’t want to go back to how it was before, but I also didn’t want to keep losing control like that. I didn’t want it to keep escalating. But, going back completely wouldn’t... be good either.” A pause. “That didn’t explain anything, did it?”

                    “No, it did! But - so, now that you’ve changed like this, what do you actually want to <em>do</em> with your powers? Are they the same as they were before? Do you want to, like, fight monsters and protect people? Or just... kinda what you were already doing...?”

                    “They’re... basically the same,” Lillian said slowly. “Which surprised me a little. I thought they would change like my form, since the darkness / poison theme kind of feels a little wrong for a light-side hero?”

Maybe it’ll change when you get an angel?”

                    “...” She decided to answer the other question instead. “I really thought a lot about this, you know. If I’m going to really become a real hero, I have to act like one, right? So, whatever it is y-you do. If it’s fighting monsters, I can do that.”

                    “A lot of the fighting is that, but a lot of the time around it’s mostly just patrols. I’ve walked around downtown so many times over the past few weeks just looking for monsters and places to transform once I found one to destroy. The really dangerous stuff, like fighting villains or defending people from a big attack, is a lot more rare. I’ve... really only fought you for villains, and only that big eel thing for not-normal monsters. Most of the time it’s just cleaning up little things around the city. Or training. Zeal loves training.”

                    “...I can do that.”

                    The two of them sat around and talked for a while. Mostly about Lillian’s change, but as neither of them really understood what was happening or what to do about it aside from asking Zeal for help, the conversation eventually drifted towards more mundane topics, somewhat to Lillian’s relief.

                    And then Zeal showed up.

                    “Afternoon, Silver,” he said as he appeared between them, interrupting Silver mid-sentence. He nodded to Lillian too. “Lavender, was it?”

                    “No - wait, I need-”

                    “Anyway,” he continued, ignoring her despite clearly revealing his presence just a moment earlier. “Your intervention is required. About three blocks that way; a dark spirit of moderate power. Come along.”

                    “No time for that,” he insisted, pushing gently at her shoulder to get her up and moving. “Hurry along or someone may get hurt. You wouldn’t want that, of course.”

                    “I’ll come too.”

                    “What?” Silver spun around to look back at her. “Don’t you have to go soon?”

                    “In another hour, but not right away. Like I said, if I’m going to be a hero, I should act like one. So, I’ll help you with the monster.” A brief pause; a slight pointing gesture. “Plus, if I don’t, I don’t think he’s going to talk to me.”

                    “...”

                    So that’s how it was that Silver ended up jogging down a busy street accompanied by an invisible Zeal floating ahead to show the way, and... “Is your hero name still Violet, by the way?” she asked while they impatiently waited for a crosswalk signal. Even if she wanted to go without the signal, there were too many cars in the way; she’d get run over. “Zeal’s been saying Lavender...?”

                    She half-grimaced. “It’s a lighter purple; I thought it might make more sense? But, no, I don’t know. There’s that registration process and I don’t know if it’s free or if I even want to change my hero name. Maybe I’d be able to figure it out if someone would talk to me!”

                    Zeal, predictably, ignored her. He wasn’t even visible to anyone besides Silver anymore. She hoped he’d be more helpful once they dealt with the monster.

                    “I guess if you’re not sure yet, should I just stick with ‘Violet’ for now? Or-”

                    “That’s fine.”

                    “Okay...” The light changed; they hurried across the street. “What’s this monster like, by the way?” Silver called ahead. “Should we be worried?”

                    “It is large and able to hide itself from ordinary senses,” he said, floating backwards above the sidewalk. “Though that ability should fade once you detect it.”

                    A twinge of deja vu, but she couldn’t quite place why. “Do you at least have a pretty narrow area where it could be, if it’s invisible or something?”

                    “Certainly,” he replied. “It is below street level, likely within or near a source of flowing fluid.”

                    “Like, by a pool? Or more like a water pipe?”

                    “Something like that.”

Violet stayed back to let Silver take the lead, though, which meant she wasn’t about to go crazy and kick down the door like Mahogany probably would. No, she had to <em>eventually</em> find someone who knew what was going on (though she did skip most of the lines by virtue of being more important and in more of a hurry than anyone else in the lobby).

                    Finally, someone knew where to find a maintenance person and after only about ten minutes of wasted time, Silver and Violet were on their way downstairs. She felt like she should be giving out tips for what to do when they found the monster, but she didn’t have as much experience with big monsters as little ones she could just bounce into the air. Aside from the eel - well, and her first one, Mr Arms - wait a minute.

                    “Zeal?” she asked hesitantly. “Is this going to be another one of those giant too-many-arms guys?”

                    “We shall find out shortly, if your search is fruitful.”

                    “It totally is, isn’t it...”

                    “Too-many-arms guys?” Violet asked from behind her.

                    “It’s what it sounds like. A big monster with too many arms. I’ve only fought one so far and it was really tough, but at least I’d have an idea where to find it.”

                    “Tough how? What should I do to prepare?”

                    “Well, it’s got, um, too many arms, so it’s hard to defend against everything at once,” she recalled. “And it can make this weird liquid that paralyzes you? Plus, if it screams, it’s so disorienting that it’s almost worse than the liquid... I think you have to get it in the head to properly get rid of it.”

                    “I don’t have many precise attacks. I don’t know if I can hit a head from very far away.”

                    “What about those streamers? Those were homing, I think. Can you do those still?”

I don’t know. That was the first time I had done that. I don’t know if I even want to do it again.”

                    “That’s okay; I can aim unattuned magic pretty good. As long as we’re careful, I can probably nail it in just a few tries. Can you try to keep its arms off of me, then?”

                    “Can I poison them? Does it need to see?”

                    “...” Silver hesitated awkwardly. “I don’t know, and probably not. It definitely doesn’t have eyes.”

                    “It sounds like none of my signature magic is going to be very helpful.”

                    “That’s okay; I first fought one of the arms guys before I even knew any signature magic, and I almost got it!” Another hesitation; she really didn’t want to admit she would have likely been killed without Mahogany’s involvement. “S-so, even if you just use unattuned, you’ll probably be okay.”

                    “We’re, uh, here,” the maintenance guy said. He stepped back, gesturing to the now-unlocked door in another moment of deja vu for Silver. “I’ll just be out here if you need anything.”

                    She nodded. “Thanks. Violet, you ready?”

                    “I guess.”

                    In they went.

                    “Look for something that seems, uh, ‘warm’,” Silver advised, glancing around at the miscellaneous machinery that she still didn’t recognize. “You can try punching the air, too; it worked last time.”

                    “... Huh?”

                    “Like, if you see something warm; or feel it, I guess...” She peered closer at a suspicious-looking cabinet, but it did not respond to her scrutiny or light taps. “It’s gotta be in here somewhere. Maybe the pipes, actually? It liked water last time.”

                    “Pipes...” Violet walked over to investigate a large tank with a few heavy-duty pipes sprouting from its top. “Feels kind of warm?”

                    Silver headed over. “Yeah, it does. Here, this is what I mean by punching the air. Ready?”

                    “Yes?”

Rippling waves of light washed over a soft, gumdrop-shaped, grey-striped body larger than a good-sized pickup truck and topped by a comically tiny eyeless head. Hundreds of hands became visible spread across every surface in the room: floors, ceiling, and walls. They were already standing on some. “See?” Silver said proudly. “What did I-”

                    The creature attacked.

                    <em>Scene 61</em>
                    Arms reared up from the floor and down from the ceiling to grab at Silver, but as they were all individually somewhat weak, she had little trouble reflecting each one back. Hands and fingers collided; joints tangled with their fellows. She quickly aimed a bolt of unattuned magic, trying to end the fight quickly, but the curtain of grey flesh was too dense; she could hardly even see its body, let alone pierce through with a single attack. One arm snapped from the impact, but dozens more replaced it.

                    “Try and distract it!” Silver yelled as she was bounced further away from the creature, having to reflect herself off the ground as fingers grabbed at her ankles from below. “I need a clear shot!”

                    Violet, for her part, had three immediate thoughts. First: this was, in fact, too many arms. Silver hadn’t been exaggerating at all. Second: she couldn’t simply reflect grabbing hands off her in the same way Silver could. She had to get off the floor. And third: the monster’s main body seemed very slow. It probably wouldn’t be able to get out of a nice cloud of mist very easily.

                    She kicked off the floor before the nearby hands - distracted trying to snare Silver - could change targets, then clambered on top of a stout cabinet. No hands <em>on</em> it, but she was under no illusion that they couldn’t get to her anyway. She’d have to keep moving. “Poison mist,” she started with, casting a faintly shimmering bubble around the center of the bulbous grey mass. Then, because she might as well get them all set up now, she followed up with a quick “sleep mist; shadow mist” as well, wreathing the monster in an overlapping cloud of various problems.

                    Several arms turned back towards its body, ripping and tugging at the air in a confused, futile attempt to tear the clouds away. Many more angled towards Violet, as the clear source of the problem. Good: she was certainly distracting it. Less good: she needed to move, <em>fast.</em>

Hands followed, crawling up from the floor and down from the ceiling; feeling their way along rather than arrowing directly through the air. Maybe the darkness was having some effect after all? Wait, some of them were digging into pipes or even the tank just below her, fingertips somehow passing through solid metal to emerge coated in a shiny, silvery liquid. Not just a handful; dozens upon hundreds of arms all around the room simultaneously dug into containers of liquid.

                    <em>“It can make this weird liquid that paralyzes you,”</em> Silver had said. Uh oh. How could she possibly avoid every single arm, if they all decided to-

                    With a coordinated movement, every silver-dipped arm flung a splatter of droplets into the air all at once. From every angle; reaching every surface. There were no blind spots and no places to hide.

                    <em>This one’s way stronger than the first one,</em> Silver thought as she deflected every paralytic droplet that came near with her rain-shield technique. <em>Not only more arms, but it’s got a better strategy, too. That definitely would have got me if I didn’t have... wait, Violet!</em>

                    A glance across the room confirmed that she was okay, hurriedly standing up from the ball she had just been curled into and removing her transparent cloak, now sodden with silver liquid. She must have barely managed to block most of it, though it was clear by the tremors that she hadn’t been <em>entirely</em> successful.

                    “Remove the darkness!” Silver shouted across the room. “I can’t see; I’m gonna go for it!”

                    A brief gesture of acknowledgement and the shroud dropped. The monster had shuffled towards the edge of the cloud, and Silver could definitely see it clearly now. Most of its arms were occupied with Violet (who had been much more of a problem in the last half-minute than Silver), so she had a chance to get a shot in before it noticed. Hopefully she didn’t miss.

Silver kicked off some piece of machinery, ignoring the clatter from behind, and bounced her way across the hand-laden floor to get up close. Most of the hands were still busy attacking Violet, so all Silver had to do was envision her intent, draw the magic into her palms, aim... and release.

                    A bolt of light exploded through the lower-left portion of the thing’s tiny head, twisting it around its neck. A partial hit, just like she had done the first time. It was so hard to hit it when it was so small and moving and-

                    The monster screeched, but only briefly; it trailed off into more of a choking rattle. The poison? That meant Silver had a chance to aim a second bolt, but not quite a chance to release it. With her attention occupied with offense, a quartet of enterprising arms managed to sneak up from below, pulling her forwards by the ankles and causing the second blast to explode uselessly into the ceiling. Silver managed to regain her reflection before cracking her skull open on the sharp corner of whatever she had been standing up, but there wasn’t much she could do to get the hands off besides shooting them too. And by the time she could manage that, dozens more would have taken their place.

                    She looked frantically to the side, hoping Violet could help her, but couldn’t see anything in that direction beyond a mass of grey arms. She might still be okay, but it wasn’t likely she’d be able to help Silver from that mess. So, she had to figure something out on her own. The monster was pulling her closer, squeezing as if to crush her, but she could reflect the crushing force. What else could it do? It could try to sprinkle more droplets on her, but she could reflect those even more easily. It could scream, but apparently not very well in the poison cloud. Were they at a stalemate?

                    “Violet!” she coughed. “Drop the poison, please!”

                    No immediate response. Maybe she was too busy to dispel it; maybe she was too hurt. Whatever the case, Silver had to deal with it herself. And quickly. She did have that idea about an air filter sort of thing she had tried on the mist the last time they fought, but it hadn’t worked very well and she hadn’t been able to test any changes since then. Still, there was no better time than now.

                    Except... Silver shifted in the monster’s many-handed grip. She couldn’t split her focus like that in such a stressful situation; raising up the filter barrier would bring down the one that was currently keeping her un-crushed. But if she didn’t do something about that poison very soon, being crushed wouldn’t be her biggest problem.

                    She changed focus, pushing the deadly air away from her mouth and nose with an unconscious filter, since she obviously couldn’t interrogate each air molecule herself. Poison: reflect. Air: let through. Somehow her magic would figure out which was which. Air grew denser to her senses, making breathing harder, but there was at least a partial success. Less pain in her airways; less dizziness in her head. Not a perfect system, but an improvement.

                    Of course, pain from the monster crushing her torso quickly replaced any pain from the poison. Bad; maybe even worse. Silver tried to regain her earlier reflective barrier, but the filter wavered when she even thought about it. Too complicated; she couldn’t envision both at once. But there was a different kind of magic that was much simpler. Drawing on her unattuned intent to stop this horrible creature, Silver wreathed her fist in light and strained against the thing’s grip. By wiggling just right, she could contest each arm one at a time rather than all at once: a contest her enhanced strength could win.

                    An explosion of light and splattering liquid.

                    Silver blacked out.

                    ...

                    Bria woke up some time later with almighty bruises on her ribs and an incredible headache. Her lungs felt like they were full of sand. But she wasn’t dead. And, without even needing to look around, it was obvious that the monster was. Mainly because it was crumpled in a heap on the floor and Zeal was blurrily visible doing... something to make it disappear. The cleanup portion.

                    Wait a minute-

                    “You’re awake!” someone suspiciously Violet-sounding gasped from nearby. Quickly, Violet appeared upside-down in her field of view to confirm that guess. “Oh my god I’m so sorry about the poison; I was buried in arms and it took so long to get out that by the time I did, you had been in there for... I don’t know, but way too long!”

                    “That’s okay,” Bria said through a series of sharp coughs. “I’m okay, I think.”

                    “Y-you are, I’m pretty sure. But, um... you’re not... um...”

                    “Transformed,” Bria finished, starting to sit up. “I noticed.” There was a slight thrum of fear as she started to understand what had happened, but realistically she had bigger problems. “We’re even now, right? That’s all that means.” Lillian wouldn’t do anything bad with that knowledge, surely. Not now that she was a light-side hero, right?

                    “... Yeah. I guess we are...”

                    An awkwardly long pause. “L-look, I’m just glad you-” Bria began, but was interrupted.

                    “I didn’t help at all!” Violet exclaimed. “I just got in your way; I’m pretty sure I even ended up hurting you more than the monster did! I’m sorry I’m such a useless hero that I don’t even deserve an angel. I’ll - I’ll do better somehow...”

This guy was way too tough for anyone’s first monster, but we killed it and we’re both okay. That’s all you can ask, really.”

                    “... <em>Despite</em> my help, instead of <em>because of</em> it.”

                    “No; you did a real good job distracting it earlier so I could get a clear shot. I just... didn’t hit it dead-on the first time.”

                    “But-”

                    “Corpse dismissed,” Zeal interrupted, floating between them. Indeed, all traces of the monster were now gone aside from the destruction the battle had left. “It is time to report and depart.”

                    “Ah! Wait, Violet had a question for you!”

                    “Come along,” he said impassively, drifting towards the door. “You have several staff members to speak to.”

                    “...” Bria gestured after him. “I - I guess we need to go...”

                    It took only another ten minutes to clear everything up with the building staff (after Bria managed to squeeze out just a little more recovered energy to return to Silver), but by then, Violet was almost out of time. She had to catch a train heading back north to return to her parents, so after returning to their base forms, Bria walked with her to the station while they both tried to get Zeal to give any straight answers.

                    “Why doesn’t she have an angel?” Bria asked. “What does she have to do to get one?”

                    “It takes time,” he shrugged. “One of us must find themself drawn to her as a partner in order to form the bond. There are, of course, always more humans around and many angels prefer to avoid those with suspected poor temperaments or distrusted pasts.”

                    “What did he say?” Lillian asked anxiously; Zeal was again only visible to Bria.

                    “...” <em>Don’t say anything mean; Zeal’s probably just being pessimistic.</em> “It can take some time,” she decided. “To, um, find the angel that’s the best fit for you.”

                    “How long?”

                    “A while. Perhaps a day; perhaps a year.”

                    “... Can you be a little more precise?”

                    “Unlikely.”

                    “He doesn’t know,” she reported. “At least a few more days?”

                    “That’s not so bad...”

                    Bria winced internally at her choices of editing. Was it bad to give her this extra optimism that might not be true, or would it be worse to just accurately relay Zeal’s pessimistic and honestly kind of condescending answers?

                    It... probably wouldn’t be a good idea to tell her exactly what Zeal was saying, Bria decided. Lillian was going through a lot. And, because it seemed to be taking her a while to come up with her next question and Bria was curious too, she asked one herself. Quietly, just in case.

                    “Could you... also be her angel, as well as mine?” Bria sorta-whispered. Enough to hide her words, but not necessarily that she was speaking at all. “I don’t know how that would work, but...”

                    “It would not,” he declared decisively. “The partner bond is highly exclusive; attempts to share or shard it have always led to dramatic failures. In the simplest cases, it has caused a total blockage of magic flow between angel and human, resulting in a loss of regenerative ability, but it is certainly not unheard of to cause more extreme issues. Such as lattice degradation - where the solid body loses its cohesion and dissolves into an irrecoverable solution of unattuned ether - or even spontaneous existence failure.” He side-eyed her in a rare display of something adjacent to humor. “I imagine you could determine the symptoms of such a condition from its name alone.”

                    “You just... poof? Just like that?”

                    “Just like that.”

                    “M-maybe it’s a good idea to not try that, after all...” <em>That doesn’t sound like a real thing. Is he joking? He doesn’t joke. IS it a real thing?</em>

                    Lillian didn’t ask what question had prompted such a response, but she did have another one to follow. “Er, this isn’t something that would really help, but I’m curious anyway... Why do I still have my powers, if I don’t have an angel at the moment...? I was always told that the magic you use for your powers comes from your partner.”

                    Bria looked over at Zeal for several seconds before remembering how insufferable he was being. Begrudgingly, she repeated the question.

A hero’s solid lattice body will naturally recover itself by converting input matter into energy to replenish any lost - a similar process to an ordinary, physical body.”

                    “You mean, eating.”

                    “I do. But the ether that binds it is another matter. <em>That</em> portion is not recovered by physical processes simply because it is not physical. For normal heroes, ether is recovered via their linked partner or, rarely, by siphoning it from other heroes through specialized attacks. Without replenishment, each use of magical power is a permanent expenditure. Over sufficient time, abilities will cease to function. Eventually, transformation will follow. And finally, even controlling one’s solid lattice body will become impossible without the fluid ether to direct it. I am assured it is quite a terrifying means of death.”

                    “...” She stared at him. He floated serenely forwards.

                    “He didn’t say anything good, I take it?” Lillian guessed. “What, um, was it? Something about eating...?”

                    “Wait wait wait,” Bria repeated, lowering her voice again. “You said you can quit being a hero and it’s fine, right? But if our bodies are like this forever, and you just said that the link is needed to refill the ether or whatever - how does that work if you quit?!”

                    A shrug. “Inactive heroes exhaust their ether extremely slowly, as they do not expend it to transform or utilize magical abilities. It is vanishingly rare for it to be depleted to a dangerous degree before the end of a human’s natural lifespan.”

                    “So she’ll be fine as long as she doesn’t use any powers?”

                    “I assume so.”

                    She looked back at Lillian, who was still wearing a questioning expression. Back at Zeal. “You’re not making this up, are you? She just spent a whole bunch of magic today in that fight! Why didn’t you say anything earlier?!”

                    “You didn’t ask.”

And he’s gone.” Indeed, Zeal had vanished during the two seconds she had taken her eyes off him. Sometimes it felt like he dedicated his time solely to annoying her. Or worse, in this case.

                    “... What did he say?”

                    “Um...” God, what should she say? Being optimistic was one thing, but if Zeal was telling the truth (surely he wouldn’t be lying about something like this, right?), withholding too much information could be really, really dangerous. “You, uh, probably shouldn’t use your powers until you get an angel.” A pause. “... At all.”

                    “Why not?” The obvious follow-up. Despite that, Bria wasn’t ready with an answer.

                    “...” <em>Be nice, but don’t hide anything really important.</em> “You’ll run out,” she decided. “And if that happens, you might not have anything left if there’s an emergency or something.”

                    “So... I only get recharged by a celestial, but I still get to keep however much charge I had before?”

                    “Y-yeah. So don’t use it unless you really, really have to!”

                    “Even if it’s just going to be a few days?”

                    “Even then! Just in case!”

                    “... Okay.”

                    Phew. That was a relief.

                    “If it’s any consolation, the emotional responses are fully within-”

                    “Go away.”

                    A pause. “This is an interesting reversal,” Zeal continued, not going away. “Usually, you are the one overstaying their welcome.”

                    “I don’t wanna talk to you.” Vanity lifted her head a little, making out a vague outline that could be Zeal in the dim light. She swatted at him ineffectually. “How’d you even get in here?”

                    “Look at the state of this place,” he said distastefully, ignoring her question. “Embarrassing. Get up.”

                    “NnooooOOOooOOOOoo...” Vani didn’t really have the strength to resist as he pulled her upright. “Leemee aloonnneee!”

                    “No. Look here.”

                    He held a small metal tablet, about the size of a playing card, in her field of view. A familiar symbol was engraved on it, surrounded by dozens more in a linked, complicated pattern. “What’s this one - ghhuhgghhg-”

                    Light flashed and steam rose. He released her a moment later, now able to stand under her own power. “Feeling better?”

                    “What the hell, Zeal?!” Vanity shouted, pushing him away. She was in fact feeling better, and she didn’t want to be. “Can’t you at leeeaaaast just let me be sad in peace? Go AWAY!”

                    “No. We made an agreement that you have not been fulfilling.”

                    “It’s only been like a few hours anyw - THREE DAYS?!” She scrambled to find her gatescribe in the mess. “Is she even still alive?”

                    “Certainly. I would never be so careless. As I attempted to state earlier, her emotional responses are fully within the expected boundaries. All is going well; we should be able to induce the proper state at will at least once. Perhaps twice, depending on specific timing.”

                    “I still hate your plan,” Vani complained, locating the little inscribed object beneath a collapsed pile of notes.

                    “Then defect. See what happens to you and your precious vessel then.”

                    She didn’t reply. She knew what would happen.

He was much faster, of course, but held his gate open while she finished hers. “And with her, Justice and Vigilance have come around. Not that either of them will be particularly helpful themselves, but their vessels do have useful connections in the lower world.”

                    “How’d you convince her to do it?” Vani grumbled, finishing her gate and proceeding through. “She always said you were being ‘too reckless’ and ‘too convoluted.’”

                    “Despair has forced her hand. Other holdouts are taking similar paths now that the deviants’ true power has become evident. They are starting to understand that they only have so many options, and most of them are ineffective.”

                    “Where...? There.” Vanity angled down towards a particular silver line rushing through the suburbs below. With Zeal still trailing behind, she passed into the train car and landed invisibly on the headrest of a particular seat. Lillian didn’t notice anything - aside from perhaps a slight sensation of heightened energy - as Vanity fully restored her ether with only a minute’s work. “I get why Compy was so down on your plans,” she breathed after finishing that up. “It <em>suuuuuucks</em> to get involved in them. I just wanna tell her it’s okaaayyy!”

                    “Do not.”

                    “I <em>know</em> that, you ass! What kind of airbrained moron do you think I am?!”

                    “One who would forget their place in the plan for three days, requiring my intervention to avoid catastrophe.” A brief pause. “Also, the term is ‘airheaded,’ or-”

                    “Shut UP!” Vani leapt back out of the train, but Zeal easily kept pace. “Yhvram and ether; you’re so annoooyyying!”

                    “And you call <em>me</em> old fashioned, with that kind of language?”

                    “Not quite.” He shifted slightly, becoming more of his other form for a few moments before reverting with another one of the pattern cards in his paw. “The ether restoration was important, but could have waited another few days. I actually intended to ask you to take on another task.”

                    “With another one of your mind-control spells?” She pointedly looked away from the card, folding her arms. “Nooooooooo thank you!”

                    “This isn’t for casting on you; it’s for you to cast on another.”

                    She didn’t say anything. He continued, clearly trying to speak as calmly as possible.

                    “Purity is becoming a problem. Her development program has begun to accelerate rapidly and as yet none of us have been able to determine why. I would like to ask you to approach her, utilizing this pattern to secure compliance if necessary, and learn how her development has improved so quickly.”

                    “Nooooooooope!” she wanted to say, but reluctantly did not. Instead, “Why me? Is it just because I used to know her back then?” She had a history with Purity, but it wasn’t entirely friendly. If anything, it might just make things more complicated.

                    “No. It’s because you are seen as the most likely to defect within our core group, so it would not be as significant a surprise as if, for instance, I were to attempt the infiltration myself.”

                    “How <em>dare</em> you! Who says that? I’ll beat ‘em up!”

                    He shrugged. “Purity, for one. Feel free to do so, once you have retrieved the required information.”

                    “... Fine,” she decided abruptly. “But just ‘cause I wanna smack her.”

                    A slight grin. He proffered the card again. “And this?”

                    Vani darted forward and snatched it. “And stop making these things. I’m siiick of ‘em!”

                    “Come now, do you really have so little trust in me?”

                    She just gave him a flat stare and left. Thankfully, it seemed he finally wasn’t following and would actually leave her alone. “What would you do if I actually went and joined them, huh?” she wondered quietly, away from anyone who could hear her. “Who’d you use for your dumb little schemes then?”

                    A pause. She rummaged for her gatescribe, preparing to head back above.

                    “Not that I would,” she reluctantly admitted to herself. “It’d be funny, but... yeah, not <em>that</em> funny.” Vanity disappeared into the gate, thoughtful. Meeting with Purity again? As cathartic as it might be to simply follow through on that smacking threat, it probably wouldn’t go well. She’d need some time to prepare.

                    ...

                    <em>July 31st, 2028</em>
                    Vanity dropped down low, peeking around the side of a building to look for her target. Bingo; exactly where she thought. Purity - in her earthly form sorta resembling a rabbit - hovered alongside a somewhat small but otherwise very ordinary girl as she walked back from school. Cheerful, relaxed - cool backpack - in the way. Vani needed to talk to just Purity, not her vessel. She could wait, but patience had never been her strong suit.

                    “Okay, Vi, let’s-” she began, before remembering. She didn’t <em>have</em> a vessel at the moment - at least, not one she could talk to. <em>Damn that Zeal. I hate his plans.</em> Well, she didn’t need a human to cause trouble. And, really, the most direct approach was often the best.

She was concealing her presence at the moment, but Purity would certainly be able to sense her anyway. Hopefully, hanging around this general vicinity for most of the day had been enough to get her guard lowered, and her incredible speed would be enough to make up for the rest.

                    By the time Purity realized something was happening and started to turn, Vanity had already smacked the card into the back of her head with that peculiar twisting, gripping motion Zeal had demonstrated. A jolt of light and the card burned instantly to ash. Success! Hopefully.

                    “What the - you?! What’s-” Her form faded briefly as she became invisible to her vessel, now looking up at empty air in confusion. “What are you <em>doing</em> here?”

                    “Heyyyyyy, Pur-i-tyyyyy!” Vanity did a slow loop in midair, drawing them both a little higher and a little out of range of the very concerned vessel’s questions. “How you been?”

                    “...” She rubbed her head in confusion. “Fine. You know we can’t be seen together, right? This better be important.”

                    Already a little disorientation and no mention of her physical assault. Zeal might be an asshole, but he was a <em>talented</em> asshole. No one else could make these cards quite like he could, which meant no one else was guarding against them properly. Vani let the first half of that thought fill her mind as she answered, still rising higher as Purity’s vessel became a small dot on the ground below. “Funny thing ‘bout that. You remember our goooooood buddy Zeal, right?”

                    “You mean the one leading the hardcore traditionalists? The one who’s been painting me and the others as some evil, crazy idiots who need to be stopped? The one that <em>you</em> threw in with? Yeah, I <em>remember</em> him.”

                    A beat as Purity struggled to determine whether she was being lied to while the potent magic of the card messed with her thoughts in subtle ways. “He didn’t.”

                    “He diiiiiiiid!”

                    “No way,” she breathed. “Really? He’d go that far? J-just to keep us stuck in the dark ages for another thousand years?” A pause. “Y-you aren’t here to...?”

                    “He did!” She slid a little closer. “But I’m not gonna. I <em>quit</em>, ‘kay? He’s the crazy one if he thinks I’m gonna hurt you~.”

                    “... You quit?”

                    “I’m sick of him and his stupid rules. This whole angel/demon thing, too. You know he made me give up my vessel just for some stupid thing about ‘emotional responses’ and ‘gotta test how the bond reacts’ and blah blah BLAH!” That came out a little louder than she had intended. Well, she was legitimately mad about it. “Look, if your fancy new stuff is so good, and this old stuff... h-hurts so much - maybe I want to give it another chance! Like I... didn’t, last time.”

                    “Your vessel...?” Purity murmured. She had those big, sad eyes, no matter what form she wore. Always looking so innocent, like her name. Vani knew she wasn’t as innocent as she looked, but that only helped so much. “I’m sorry... I know it’s hard...”

                    “And he treats ‘em like disposable tools!” she yelled, deviating from her script even further. “Sayin’ stuff like ‘we always outlast them’ - yeah, well, that doesn’t make ‘em any less important!”

                    “Yeah. Yeah! I know - we - I think...” She hesitated, looking so frustratingly cute and uncertain, even when wearing the guise of a semi-mouse-rabbit-like creature. “I’m trying to fix it. To make it so we don’t need to hurt humans anymore.”

                    “The homunculi?” she whispered.

Technically against a variety of regulations, laws, treaties, and the like. But every celestial knew that both major factions in this current conflict were working frantically on them, so no one dared to enforce any of those rules. “Yes.”

                    “Perfect vessels, Zeal says.”

                    “Y-yeah. But his won’t ever be perfect, ‘cause he’s too scared of progress.”

                    “You aren’t?”

                    Surprisingly, that was the question that finally got Purity to meet her eyes properly. “No. I’m not.” Then she looked away again, returning her gaze vaguely downward. They had been rising this whole time, though, so her vessel wasn’t visible. “I-if you’re really serious, and you want to g-give it another chance...?”

                    “...” Oh, it was so hard to lie to those eyes. Or was she even lying at this point? Focus. “I wanna.”

                    A relieved, happy smile. “I’ve been waiting so long to hear you say that,” she exhaled, spinning in place as her form threatened to revert to her upper version. “There’s so much I want to show you; so much you can do to help... i-if you w-want!”

                    “I already said I wanna!” she replied, getting a little fired up despite her sabotage mission. Preemptive guilt started to gnaw. Was this just due to the card? Had Vani just been overreacting all those years ago? “So let’s go already!”

                    “Malice is out at the moment,” Purity explained as they headed quietly down a long, wide hallway. “So this is the perfect time to bring you here for an introduction. She can be a... a little hard to deal with, sometimes.”

                    “Ah, like Zeal, huh?”

                    “No! Not like him; at least she lets me do things the way I think is best.”

                    “If she’s not mind-controlling you,” Vanity did not say. This was one of the reasons she had gone to Zeal in the first place: Malice, the “leader” of this group, had always been more than a little manipulative. But with her powers multiplied, she was now capable of bending minds to her will - and not just human ones. It was a scary thought, and Malice was absolutely not one who could be trusted with the power. Which made Zeal’s recent delvings into the same field of study even more concerning, because she super didn’t trust him with that kind of thing either.

                    It was certainly possible that Purity was being controlled to some degree, but it was unlikely to be a huge amount. Everyone knew that the more you controlled someone else’s mind, the more their creativity and problem-solving skills declined. That might be okay for regular grunts, but not for one of your top scientists. Purity certainly still controlled most of her own thoughts; her results proved that. (Although maybe a little less right this instant, with that card still in effect.)

                    “That might be nice,” Vanity actually did say, deciding to just agree. It would be nice.

                    “Also, I think Fortune’s gone too, but Despair might be here somewhere. We should, um, probably avoid him too. Just in case.”

                    “Good idea.” Despair scared her. He scared everybody, just by reputation alone. No other celestial had as much blood on their hands.

                    “Okay, this is the wellspring,” Purity explained, tapping gently on a plain white door. “I know how to do the blessings, so if you want... w-we can power you up right now.”

The wellspring. One of only four known sources of the mysterious power that blessed and cursed the celestials willing to imbue themselves with it. Vani didn’t really know much about how it worked - no one did, unless they had taken it into themselves - but it was the reason why Malice, Despair, Purity, and the like were so much stronger than anyone else. The power contained in the wellspring dramatically increased celestial powers, though that increase came at a cost. Some celestials thought the benefits were worth that cost; others did not. At its core, that’s what this whole conflict was about.

                    “I’m... not sure if I’m ready to commit to that just yet,” Vani said, trying to speak like Purity did. “It’s a lot so soon, after so long being against it...”

                    “N-no, that’s okay!” She moved on, leaving the wellspring’s door unopened and any secrets beyond it unseen. “I get it! It’s a big step; w-when you’re ready!”

                    “Thanks.” A hesitation; she <em>really</em> wished she knew how much of Purity’s attitude was due to the card and how much was actually her. And if anything was due to Malice’s control, now that she thought about it. “For being so understanding.”

                    “Hehe. I don’t want to force you into anything.”

                    ...
                    <em>July 33rd, 2028</em>

                    “Your little guy is so cute!” Vani exclaimed, pushing up against the table to lean over the aforementioned guy. “And he’s so <em>finished!</em> Zeal’s guy is cute, too, but not so <em>clean.</em>”

                    “Thanks. I wish Malice saw it that way.” Purity shook her head, casting off that thought. “A-anyway, I’ve made a lot of progress recently. I wanted to catch up to Zeal first, so I started with the eyes-”

                    “Very human-looking,” Vani commented, peering close. “Kind of dead, th - woah! Not dead!”

                    Purity giggled, tapping out a short command. “Next, I wanted to work on stability. That was the hardest part, but it turned out that the answer was actually really easy! Look how tough the skin is now; I can barely get a needle in there!”

                    “... Wow. How’d, uh, you do it?”

                    “Mm hm!”

                    “H-how - did you... You can’t - d-does she <em>know?</em> About us?”

                    “Nope! Malice wipes her memory every time before she goes home. I keep it in storage here so I can look it over if I need to, and so we can put it back in whenever she comes back. But it turns out that humans are just naturally really good at talking with homunculi, and it’s even better because my vessel is really, really good at growth and healing and that sort of thing. Just being able to keep it alive outside of the tank for more than a few minutes was <em>such</em> a big help, but even beyond that, she could help fix all sorts of flaws in its body, that I can then put back into the template for the next one!” A pause; a little wry smile. “And Zeal would never, ever dare to do this, so he’s never, ever gonna catch up!”

                    “Y-you’re so right.” He was a real stickler for the rules. After all, he co-wrote most of them.

                    At this point, Vanity could probably leave. She knew how Purity had been making such rapid progress; that’s what Zeal had asked her to do.

                    But.

                    There was more she could do here. No matter whose side she wanted to take.

                    <em>Scene 67</em>
                    <em>Jorge 090st, 20288</em>

                    A continuous stream of quiet giggling emanated from somewhere within the walls. Purity found this hilarious, but could only manage a few sporadic chuckles. She counted the stars in the ceiling, but it was difficult as they kept moving around and overlapping.

                    “You good?” Vani asked from the vague direction of a ventilation shaft far too small to fit any of her standard forms. This room didn’t need ventilation, anyway. “You look goooooddd.......”

                    An outburst of snickering. The lights bent out of shape; tied themselves in knots. Illumination became stuck. The ventilation shaft figured it might serve better as a door and became one.

                    “Where... even are youoouoooouu...???” Vani swam through gelatinous space, ducking between aberrant furniture. Something chortled. “Where even is... anything??”

                    Nothing presented itself, but it was not an acceptable anything. Vanity moved on. The ventilation door decided to try life as a window, complete with a cooling pie on the sill. Fragrant particles wafted through its duct-like corridors, passing into every corner of the facility. Nothing became infused with the scent of lemon-cinnamon. Anything laughed out loud.

                    “Puuurrrriiiii??......?” Vani called into the pie-galaxy. Something muttered under the wind. More illogical snickering. The ventilation window sprouted another pie. Apple-apple-apple mixed with lemon-cinnamon.

                    “Who left the lights...?” she mused. The tangle became flavored. Lemon-apple-cinnamon-apple-apple coated every surface in a brilliant glow. Something tasted it and laughed. Nothing responded in kind.

                    “What was I.........???” Vani couldn’t remember. All of the things chuckled, and snickered, and chortled, and-

But... “Where did I...?” Vani rummaged through her belongings. An endless flood of socks poured into the walls, painting them sock-colored with the texture. “These aren’t mine...” They weren’t. The ventilation window commiserated and offered a third pie. The heady scent of distilled pie essence consumed the socks. The walls couldn’t understand and threw up. Dozens of lost keys pelted the tangled light fixtures orbiting nothing in particular.

                    “No, I put it somewhere else... !!”

                    The card was already inside her. Vanity squeezed down into a smaller space, shrinking and compressing and pressing against the card in just the right way. The ventilation window peered closer, pie-drops dripping onto her form with painful plips. Scorching hot pie-flavored vortices whirled closer as something cackled from beyond the-

                    <em>August 2nd, 2028</em>

                    Vanity woke up.

                    She sat up, catching her breath and coughing up little sooty particles from the card she had eaten previously. Her form trembled with instability as the spell from that pattern fought against the frankly irresponsible dose of ico-bricks she had taken... she checked: two hours ago. It hadn’t been too long.

                    She stood up, pressing a hand against her temple as a headache thumped through her human-shaped skull. Her form was stuck like this for now, as trying to shift it would send her right back into the drug-induced abyss - but without a card to recover, this time. Damn, it hurt. How did humans stand it all the time?

                    Purity gently snickered to herself on a nearby couch, muttering something about pie. Her form, too, was locked as human for safety, but without the card there were twinges of fluidity around her extremities. Vani patted her on the head, draped a tablecloth over her as she couldn’t find a blanket, then padded unsteadily out of the room. Where were her shoes? How did she get this many socks?

                    Ggguhhhf...

But it <em>had</em> worked. The extra card had let her escape the bricks’ influence far faster than she should have - and crucially, far faster than Purity, still completely out of it in the other room. How had she even convinced her to go along with it, actually? Everything was a bit blurry.

                    Focus. The guy. Where was the lab again?

                    Vanity stumbled through darkened corridors for a while, passing by the wellspring room (or at least doors that looked like it) thrice before finally arriving. The door had somehow become a window at some point, complete with three weird-looking pies, so she didn’t even have to break in. She just popped the latch open and climbed through.

                    The guy was there, just chilling in its little bed-like thing. Asleep... Nope! Eyes open; looking at her.

                    “Hey, little dude,” Vani whispered. “Just here to pick up some stuff for Purity. You don’t mind that, right?”

                    It didn’t say anything; just tracked her with those strangely luminous but otherwise very human-looking eyes. She decided to assume that meant it didn’t mind.

                    “That’s right; you wouldn’t snitch.” She rubbed her head again, groaning at the aching pressure. “Let’s get started, then.”

                    ...

                    Purity woke up as a puddle on the floor. It took her a while to pull herself together enough to approximate a solid form, then even longer to accomplish something approximating locomotion. Briefly, she wondered what had happened last night, but it was immediately clear those memories were completely gone. Replaced entirely by ico-brick hallucinations. Oh, this was so very irresponsible. Why had... Vanity had been there! Where-?

As usual, she found a human-like form most stable and easiest to maneuver. Most celestials did, since - well, it wasn’t totally clear. Shaking off the remnants of a probably terrible headache, she wandered the facility for a while looking for Vanity.

                    No luck. Uh oh.

                    With something approximating panic beginning to rise (not improving her headache or queasiness, by the way), Purity hurried back to the lab. She had been suspicious of Vanity from the start, right? Surely she <em>should</em> have been - but somehow she couldn’t remember doing any of the usual security checks. Had she even <em>told</em> anyone that Vanity was here?

                    “The door is a window,” she remarked to no one in particular. Maybe the pies. They were cold by now; this had been here a while.

                    <em>Scene 68</em>
                    A portion of anxiety dropped away as the homunculus waved mutely from its enclosure. A quick examination revealed nothing obviously amiss: no fires, no missing equipment or notes, and no damage to the quasi-living template that formed the backbone of this project. She exhaled in relief. Maybe Vani had just had to go? But without leaving a note or something...? Besides, where would she be going? Not back to Zeal, if she had been telling the truth...

                    In the middle of trying to marshal her thoughts into something approximating a plan, Purity noticed a soft thump of pressure dispersing through the facility. The anxiety returned: Malice was back. Oh, no no no; she couldn’t face her right now. She had to hide this terrible breach of protocol, whether or not Vanity had actually done anything. Surely by now, this would be the last straw. She’d lose her position, and then...

                    No. Don’t panic. Malice couldn’t <em>read</em> minds - only change them - so as long as there wasn’t any evidence of a problem, she’d never know! That just meant Purity had to triple-check everything that could give it away, starting with the pie-window and anything else in the facility. But past that - she strained, but couldn’t quite remember. Had she told Vanity about her vessel...? Didn’t matter; she’d assume the worst. In just a few minutes, she’d have to go check and make sure everything in the lower world was okay. Just after dealing with the pie. And all these socks. Who had this many socks?

                    ...

                    “Zeal,” Bria said flatly. “I’m not kidnapping a kid for you.”

                    “I said nothing of the sort. You are twisting my intentions to suit your narrative.” He was sitting on her shoulder today, which was kind of annoying because she couldn’t see him without craning her neck awkwardly. “To begin with, ‘kid’ is an imprecise term for-”

Is that better?”

                    “Again, you misconstrue the objective of this operation.”

                    “You said you wanted me to intercept a freshman on her way home and ‘convince’ her to go somewhere else.”

                    “I did not perform those air quotes.”

                    “You might as well have! What do you think I’m going to do, offer some candy? I’d get arrested!”

                    “The methodology is up to your discretion, but the objective is of critical importance to the continued safety of the surrounding metropolitan area.”

                    “Listen, this kid isn’t a villain, right?”

                    “Not objectively-”

                    “And she’s not a monster - er, dark spirit.”

                    “... No.”

                    “Then why should I be bothering her? What’s gonna happen to the ‘metropolitan area’ if I don’t?”

                    “Undoubtedly terrible things.”

                    “Why won’t you ever give me a straight answer?!” she yelled, considering punching a nearby wall for effect but deciding against it because that would probably hurt a lot.

                    He huffed in annoyance as well. “Your continued desire to hear truthful statements has led to this confrontation. Had I simply indicated a monster in the area, you would certainly have had little problem proceeding as planned.”

                    “Wh - yeah, until I got there and there wasn’t a monster!”

                    “At that point it would be immaterial.” A pause. “Would you consider proceeding to the proper location and simply standing in place for three minutes, if it resulted in-”

                    “Not after all this!”

                    Another pause. “Very well. I will provide stronger motivation.”

                    And then he vanished.

                    Bria stood in place for several seconds. “Zeal? What did you mean by that?” <em>There’s no way he means anything good, right?</em> “What are you going to do?”

Bria hesitated a few more slowly accelerating heartbeats before making a snap decision and jogging towards the train station. Zeal would find something extremely “motivating,” and in the event he did something insane like take her dad hostage (surely not, but she was thinking worst case scenario here), she would be better off able to move fast. Just in case she ended up deciding to go along with it.

                    Her phone rang before she even arrived at the platform. A brief grimace, but she picked up. “Hello?”

                    “Heyyy! Silver, how’s it going?” Strawberry asked casually.

                    “... Fine-”

                    “Great, listen, pretty please can you meet us at Union Station on the very next train?”

                    “... Why? And how do you even know I can <em>make</em> the next train?”

                    “You ‘member what I told you ‘bout those ‘worse-than-demons’ demons a bit ago?” She was speaking very quickly and sounded a little out of breath. What was that background noise? Wind?

                    “Yes...?”

                    “Good - oop, just a -” Something loud crashed through the connection; Bria pulled the phone away from her ear. What was going <em>on</em> over there? “- kay, we’re gonna take one of those out. It’s a big ambush on, like, the third most dangerous dude in the city. I really, super, duper want your help if you can pleeease? Hog thinks so too; right, buddy?”

                    A muffled “you bet!” filtered through.

                    “I - I mean, sure? I-if you need my help, I can... er, where is this? Union Station?”

                    “No, we’re gonna meet you there and go after ‘em from there!”

                    “Did Zeal put you up to this?”

                    “Gotta go! Also, your bestie Violet’s here too, so you better make sure - oop, hold -”

                    The call ended.

                    <em>Scene 69</em>
                    The train stopped; the doors opened. Bria hesitated as other passengers boarded and disembarked. This sounded like a trick, a trap, or generally just a bad idea. Yet, of course, there wasn’t really any way she could say no, was there? There were too many unknowns and too much to learn by going. And if Zeal was actually right, or if Strawberry was telling the truth (surely, right?)...

                    Bria stepped aboard, fishing out her phone to buy the unexpected ticket. Her friends wouldn’t lie to her. Would they?

                    ...

                    Strawberry fell from the sky.

                    But that was okay, because she meant to do that. “We’re far enough!” she yelled to Mahogany over the rushing wind. “Next drop, kay?”

                    “You got it!” he shouted back, starting to shift his wings away.

                    Strawberry slowed and redirected her descent with a curved ring of pink energy, angling back into the air just as an entire tree whipped past. Her slide shattered on impact, spraying her and her passenger with fragments of dissolving energy and altogether too many pine needles. It’s fine; that’s what the redirection was for. Just one more clever trick and they’d be away.

                    Two more trees ripped themselves out of the ground, followed by a dozen more in a rapid-fire attack. Umber was getting serious, or at least she really hoped he was. If this amount of firepower was still him playing around-

                    “BRACE!”

                    The trees were huge. Even with her extreme midair maneuverability, carrying Hog increased her weight too much; she couldn’t dodge everything. A smaller side branch whipped past, breaking through her barriers and carving a shallow cut down her side with its remaining energy. Splintered wood and needles sprayed into the air. Strawberry let herself be carried along with the momentum of the hit, beginning to fall back towards the ground.

                    “Ready?”

                    “Hit it!”

                    And hit it they did. The ground, that is.

Excess material fountained to fill the tunnel behind them, essentially burying the heroes in an underground tomb. At least, it would be a tomb if Hog couldn’t keep digging.

                    “I really don’t understand how this shift works,” Strawberry murmured, shedding pink light as she crawled along behind him while trying to seal the cut made by that tree a minute ago. “How are you making your arms spin like that?”

                    His reply was too muffled to be of any use, obscured within a conical shell that somehow bit into the earth like a drill. Even with roots, heavy clay, and some sparse rocks reinforcing the dirt, he could still move just a little slower than walking speed. Strawberry had to stick very close behind him to avoid being buried alive by the spoil.

                    “I get it’s magic,” she continued. “But, like, that’s gotta be physically impossible.”

                    Another muffled comment.

                    “I guess you’re right; I can’t say that when I can fly and do all this, huh? Your power just seems a little more plausible than mine?”

                    An undulation of the “drill” that could be generously interpreted as a shrug.

                    “About a hundred more feet to go, I think. But stop if you feel anything heavy; I don’t know if he has any idea where we went. And remember, change back as soon as we surface so he can’t sense us.”

                    Muffled grumbles. The dig continued.

                    “I’m just glad it worked. He’ll be distracted here for a while, hopefully.”

                    Mahogany tried extra-hard this time, finally resulting in some intelligible words. “Don’t jinx it yet.”

                    ...

                    “Violet, huh?” Lapis leaned back against the bench. “Never heard of you.”

                    Granite took the opportunity to be helpful. “I believe she was the one who accidentally murdered that police-”

                    “Shut it. You’ve never heard’ve her either, got it?”

                    “What?”

                    “No, it’s ‘who?’ Like, ‘who is this Violet girl, because I’ve never heard of her.’”

If I simply-”

                    Lapis swung her legs off the bench and stood up. “‘Scuse me one minute,” she said to the so-far mute Violet. Then, to Granite, “C’mere, you. I’ll spell it out straight.”

                    Violet hesitated as the other two heroes disappeared behind a pillar. Lapis wasn’t like what she had been expecting. She hadn’t met a hero of darkness before, but had kind of thought they would be mean and brooding and scheming. In retrospect, she wasn’t sure why she thought that, given she had until recently been one too, but in any case Lapis seemed more... comfortable than she would have expected.

                    Which was good, because she didn’t know anyone here. Zeal had just popped up again, vaguely apologizing for some handwaved procedures taking so long to get her angel situation sorted out and then telling her to prove herself worthy by meeting up with a bunch of other heroes at Union Station. The idea that Zeal was just stringing her along at this point had occurred to her (though she wished it hadn’t), but as she wasn’t really willing to risk messing it up even further, here she was.

                    So far, Granite had seemed pretty wary of her, Lapis had been grumbly but not antagonistic, and then there was a group of three guys in suits quietly talking amongst themselves nearby that <em>seemed</em> like they were part of this whole thing but no one had come over to say anything so she wasn’t really <em>sure</em>...

                    “...”

One of the other guys glanced over too, nodding in a way that could maybe be interpreted as asking her to come over but could have just been a regular nod. Why were Lapis and Granite taking so long? Forget about knowing anyone; at least she had their <em>names!</em>

                    Bria disembarked and found a nearby restroom to transform. Strawberry and the others still only knew her as Silver, so she had better arrive looking the part. Of course, with Violet also involved, who knew exactly how many people would be here. Zeal hadn’t showed up again since she got on the train - presumably since she had been doing what he wanted - but he faded back into view as she hurried through the concourse looking for the way out.

                    “Your role will be primarily defensive,” he said without any preamble, hovering along backwards to match her speed and direction. “Prevent the enemy from interfering with those who will perform the extermination.”

                    “I’m not killing anyone for you either,” she commented softly. “Or helping anyone do it; that’s the same thing.”

                    “The target is a corrupted spirit, not a human. You should have no compunctions against such a task.”

                    “We’re attacking a monster? Then what was all that about the - waaaiit, this isn’t a lie like you said you should have done to start with, is it?”

                    “No. The vessel will be involved, but need not necessarily be harmed. As long as she does not interfere.”

                    “... I’m just gonna ask the others what’s going on.”

                    “Feel free. Just recall your role. Defend your allies; stay vigilant. Reflect any harm and do not attempt to perform any attacks, regardless of the situation.”

                    “Good. You’re the one who always keeps trying to get me to kill things more; I’m happy to not do that for once.”

                    There were more people than she expected.

Aside from Silver herself, she spotted Strawberry and Granite trying to bring some level of order to the gathering, Mahogany mostly ignoring them, Violet sitting quietly with Lapis, three suited guys she didn’t recognize chatting amongst themselves, and a fourth suited guy standing off by himself but seeming to be listening. Ten heroes, all in one place and all (presumably) on their way to do the same thing. Had that ever happened before? If it had, she couldn’t think of when; heroes tended to go solo or rarely team up in twos or threes. This many heroes together would represent a sizable portion of all the heroes in the entire metropolitan region.

                    Violet noticed her and seemed about ready to walk over, but Strawberry noticed too and was faster. “Finally! You’re the last one here and we really gotta hurry. Everyone else already knows what’s going on, so I’ll explain on the way!”

                    A little intimidated by all these eyes on her, Silver just agreed.

                    “So that’s what we know ‘bout those ‘worse-than-demons,’ got it?” Strawberry said loudly a few minutes later, talking over the wind. She was carrying three of the group (plus herself), Lapis held Violet, and it seemed the lonesome suit guy had a power involving magnetism or something, because he raised the rest by invisibly pulling along large metal trapeze-like bars. The whole group flew in a mostly northern direction, though no one was entirely stable with so many passengers.

                    “I - I think so?” Silver was having a hard time hearing. “Some celestials are trying to grab more power than they should. But you’re leaving out a lot of details!”

                    “Complain to Compy and Havoc! You know what celestials’re like when you ask them for details!”

                    “Yep! You know Hog and Granite already, and Lapis of course. Then the suit brigade are some guys from Hog’s former group who wanted to help out - I think they’re, um, Maroon, Mocha, Moss... was the fourth guy an ‘M’ name too? No; Onyx! He’s the magnet guy. And <em>then</em>, it sounds like <em>someone’s</em> angel told Miss Not-as-villainous-anymore Violet to show up. Although I dunno what she’s gonna do if she can’t use her magic.”

                    “So... you’re okay with her now?”

                    “I mean... kinda?” Strawberry wobbled in midair as she tried to use a hand gesture, shaking the net around. “Whoops. Kinda. I don’t think she meant to, and she obvi feels real bad about it, but, like... it still happened, y’know? A-anyway, for now she’s helping! And we’re a bit off-topic, hm?”

                    “Yeah. So, what’s the plan?”

                    “Real simple. We know where the partner’s gonna be, so we go find her and... ‘do something’ - Compy says she’ll help when it’s time - to make the worse-than-a-demon show up. Then, it’s just like a regular monster fight except there are a ton of us! Shouldn’t be a problem!”

                    “Even if it’s ‘worse than a demon?’ Did you come up with a battle plan?”

                    “Well, sorta. Me and Hog are used to working together, and so are him and Granite, and all the suit guys. So, like, a few teams of buddies helpin’ each other out and-”

                    Someone shouted from ahead; the other fliers began to descend.

                    “Crap, we’re here already?” Strawberry began to fly lower as well, dipping towards a tree-lined street. “Kay, Sil, your job is to keep us safe, got it? Compy says something might show up that you’re gonna be best at dealing with, so pretty please keep an eye out? And maybe you can buddy up with Violet since she can’t be using her magic?”

                    <em>Scene 71</em>
                    Events moved quickly for a time. Flying heroes landed; people hurried around to get into prearranged positions that Silver had apparently been too late to learn. She and Violet got bumped a bit farther away to crouch uneasily behind a thick set of bushes surrounding a small park. Then, silence for slightly less than a minute. Silver very much wanted to say something - maybe ask Violet what she thought about this whole thing - but didn’t dare break the quiet.

                    Then, a cheerful but otherwise very normal-looking girl came into view wearing a backpack and carrying a slightly dirty cardboard box. An angel faded into view above the trees, pointed briefly, then disappeared. Silver held her breath anxiously; what was about to happen? What had everyone else agreed on?

                    Not all that much, apparently. Strawberry, as the closest in age and potentially the least intimidating, just sort of stepped out from behind her tree and stopped the girl. A quiet greeting, followed by a nervous “Who are you?” from the girl. Followed again by a significantly more nervous question as more of the heroes gathered in a loose ring around her.

                    “I don’t like this,” Silver whispered to Violet, now that other people were talking. “Are you <em>sure</em> they’re not going to hurt her at all?”

                    “I’m not sure about anything!” she unhelpfully replied. “I barely even know why we’re here or what she has to do with this really bad demon that everyone was talking about!”

                    “Should I stop them?” she asked, unfairly. Of course Violet wouldn’t have a good answer and she didn’t expect her to. But she needed to ask the question anyway. “But if everyone was telling the truth...”

                    “... I don’t know...”
                    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1374560851507413052 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1374560851507413052><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 20, 2025 9:34 PM">9:34 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>As expected. Silver hesitated a little longer, carefully noting that no one was doing anything besides talking and standing in the girl’s way. No attacks, no overt threats of violence. She could intervene if anything <em>actually</em> happened, right? They promised - even Zeal said. And it was all to take down a powerful monster. It just... it really didn’t feel heroic just sitting here and watching her friends harass someone like this.

                    Then again, being a hero didn’t feel terribly heroic most of the time anyway.

                    Something changed. The wind picked up. Angels popped into visibility above the ring of heroes, including Zeal and - wait, was that-

                    “Vanity?” Violet breathed, immediately recognizing the darker, almost bat-like form. “Wh-what are you-”

                    And then a brilliant burst of light and sound erupted from the center of the ring. Illuminant wings spread into the sky; a halo of brilliant white drenched the trees in radiance. The image of what angels <em>should</em> have looked like, before humanity discovered they tended to resemble little flying animal mascots. A voice thundered across the surrounding neighborhood: “YOU TRAITOR!”

                    Someone shouted back. “ATTACK!”

                    Events got a little chaotic from there. Heroes scattered; the manifested angel-demon fired brilliant, scorching bolts in multiple directions. Silver ducked down further, wondering what on earth she was supposed to be doing. Defend her allies? Against <em>that?</em> Or was she supposed to be keeping an eye out for something worse?
                    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1374560915738984529 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1374560915738984529><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 20, 2025 9:34 PM">9:34 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The bush was on fire. “Move, move!” She and Violet dashed off in search of sturdier cover, taking in the fight as impressions while they ran. Curved pink shield domes suggested Strawberry was also taking more of a supportive role. Bolts of lightning arced in slow motion between metal objects. Flames spread amongst the greenery; wood charred and smoked with flames ranging in color from red through orange and blue all the way to a pale purple-white. Bursts of painful heat finally provided the first meaningful way for Silver to participate, reflecting the rapidly fluctuating temperature away from her and Violet as they crossed the park.

                    “Where did everyone go?” she asked urgently as they caught their breath near the far end of the park. Flames burned around the entire perimeter already, as well as part way down both side streets. Smoke already clouded the air, making it difficult to see even the blazing angelic/demonic presence, let alone any of her less-visible allies. “How did it get so hazy so quick?”

                    “I think it’s over by those trees; some people are probably still close by?”

                    The sharp crack of an explosion punctuated Violet’s sentence; dirt sprayed into the increasingly smoky air. “... Let’s go!”

                    Unfortunately, by the time they ran the perhaps forty feet over to the trees in question, the sound of battle had moved across the park again. All that was left here were several burning trees pouring acrid smoke into the air, a few strange, glittering afterimages of a bright light, and a partially melted copper rod split unevenly in two.

                    “This way?” Silver guessed, listening. Her eyes watered from all the smoke; was this actually normal for this much fire or was it being enhanced? She might have to start that air filtering barrier soon if this kept up.

                    “Sounds right; hurry!”
                    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1374560976615116924 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1374560976615116924><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 20, 2025 9:34 PM">9:34 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>This process repeated twice more as the smoke grew chokingly thick and emergency sirens became audible nearby. Somehow, the battle always moved on just before they arrived, no matter which angle or how fast they ran. Worse, it was clear people were being hurt - just somewhere out of sight. Screams of pain mixed with crackling flames and the occasional sharp, rattling explosion. But... “Where <em>is</em> everybody?!” Silver yelled, exasperated. “How are we supposed to help if we can’t even find anyone?”

                    “Should we get out of the smoke for a second?” Violet coughed. Silver didn’t have enough practice to make the filter apply to her too, but at least her cloak helped to some degree. “Get our bearings? I don’t even know where we are anymore.”

                    “... That’s probably smart,” Silver begrudgingly agreed. “There has to be some trick to this smoke; there’s no way it’s this thick naturally.”

                    “And there’s no way we’ve missed everyone every time, even by blind luck.” Violet paused. “Wait, blind. If this is like my mist...”

                    Silver paused too.

                    “If the currents are going <em>that</em> way, then...” She straightened up, pointing in what seemed a completely arbitrary direction. “The source of this smoke is this way! C’mon!”

                    Whether due to trust in Violet or simply lacking any better options, Silver followed close behind. And, in only a few moments, the smoke thinned out somewhat to reveal a girl with a backpack and dirty cardboard box formerly sitting on a bench, but now jumping up in surprise.

                    <em>Scene 72</em>
                    “HEY!” Acting on impulse, Silver leapt forward as the girl stood, fumbling for the box. It had to be important, right? Maybe it was the source of the smoke? Silver lunged for it, snatching the cardboard away with just a quick tug; the girl seemed both to not be very strong and to want to leave as quickly as possible. She let go immediately and dashed into the smoke.

                    “What was - why did you do that?” Violet asked, approaching quickly. “Is it something magical?”

                    “I don’t know, but it sure seemed like it and there’s one good way to find out.” Silver put a hand on the lid, then glanced to the side. “Maybe stand back a little, in case it’s a bomb or something?”

                    “It’s not a bomb!”

                    “I sure hope not.” Squeezing her eyes nearly shut (as if that would do anything), Silver wasted no further time in opening the lid to reveal the box’s mysterious contents... a four-pack of perfectly ordinary flowers in their plastic protector thingies and a bit of loose dirt.

                    “... Are those petunias?”

                    “... I don’t know!” Silver shut the box again after a brief once-over to make sure the flowers weren’t hiding any bombs or the like, then turned back to Violet. “Can you find her again?”

                    “Maybe, if the cloud cooperates...”

                    <em>Ugh, that was so dumb. I should’ve been more calm about it, not just stealing her flowers. Why does she even have flowers? Is it totally unrelated? Just buying some stuff for her garden? Or are they actually important for some other-</em>

                    “This way!” Violet exclaimed, covering her mouth with her cloak. The smoke was getting truly atrocious; anyone without some way of filtering the air would be in serious danger of suffocating by now. Silver really hoped her friends had made it out of the cloud or had other contingencies, because she was doing a terrible job protecting them at the moment. To that end, the still-ongoing explosions seemed almost a positive sign: at least they meant <em>someone</em> was still fighting.

Silver took a few cautious steps forward. “Sorry; I thought there was something dangerous in here. I don’t want to hurt you, so can - hey, WAIT!”

                    Predictably, the girl ran for it a second time. But this time, not distracted by the mysterious box of flowers, Silver was able to run after-

                    Violet dashed past her, then tackled the girl. A reminder of the more aggressive personality she had held before the aftermath of their second fight. “Got ‘er!” she called from the smoke nearby. “Hurry up, say what you wanted before - ow; get - just hurry up, please!”

                    “Don’t hurt her!” Silver hurried over, kneeling next to them. “Listen, I’m really sorry, but I just want to talk. If she lets you go, can you stay here just for a few minutes? A-also, you can have your flowers back... s-sorry, again.” <em>Real smooth.</em>

                    “...” The girl stopped struggling; she wasn’t making any headway against Violet anyway. “F-fine...”

                    Silver nodded pointedly. “Violet?”

                    “Don’t blame me if she runs off again,” she commented, then stood up to let her go.

                    Fortunately, she didn’t go far, just sitting up and reaching out for the box, which Silver hesitated only briefly before handing over. Another explosion vaguely nearby reminded her that time was short, so she hurried up. “Er, I’m Silver and this is Violet. And you...?”

                    “I’m Snow,” she said. “Why are you trying to act nice when you’re doing all this?”

                    “...” It was a good question. “Because we don’t have anything against <em>you</em>. It’s just... your um, angel...” Silver was somewhat stymied by not really knowing what was going on herself; she only had that brief, wind-torn conversation with Strawberry and a few comments from Zeal to explain anything.

                    “Purity’s just fine!” Snow yelled, seemingly unaffected by all the smoke. “She thought something like this might happen! She doesn’t hurt anyone; it’s you people who do! L-look at what you’re doing <em>right now!</em> All sh-she’s doing is trying to make the wellspring safe for everyone, so we can get rid of all the monsters!”

                    A pause. “You... already know about the wellspring?” Violet asked.

                    “Yeah! I bet you don’t even know what it is!”

                    “I know what it is!”

                    “You say it!”

                    Another explosion, this one much closer. Silver had to deflect a surge of heat and flame around the three of them. “We don’t have time for this! Look, clearly we have a lot to talk about, so maybe let’s try and stop all the fighting before someone dies?”

                    “You tell your people to stop first! You attacked us!”

                    “I - I would, but I can’t <em>find</em> anyone in all the smoke!” Silver exclaimed. It was now near-impossible to even see Snow and Violet, and they were within arm’s reach. “You’re doing that, right? Can you turn it off so we can stop everything?”

                    “If I turn it off, you’ll try to hurt Purity!”

                    “I won’t, I promise!”

                    “Your friends will!”

                    “I’ll stop them!”

                    “They won’t listen to you!”

                    “...” The words “They will!” lodged in her throat. She couldn’t know that for sure. But, really, what other choice did they have? If the smoke stayed, they couldn’t even <em>try</em> to stop the fighting.

                    “The smoke’s just going to be hurting Purity as much as anyone else,” Silver asserted, trying a different tactic. “It’s just causing confusion for everyone and she won’t be able to see attacks coming either. All this fighting can only stop if everyone can communicate and see what’s going on!”

                    “...” A very nearby explosion caused all three of them to flinch. Dirt and pebbles scattered nearby. “You have to promise you’ll make them stop! Both of you!”

                    “I will. Promise.” Silver looked over at Violet, though she couldn’t even see her face by now.

                    “Promise,” she said softly.

                    “Then... then hurry up and do it!” There was a rustling sound, then a loud <em>whoosh</em> as fresh, clean air blasted out from Snow’s open backpack. The smoke quickly began to thin, revealing the three of them, the fountain, more of the park, and then a very big problem.

                    Most of the heroes lay scattered across the park, burned and unconscious or worse. Only two were still moving: Strawberry slowly crawled towards someone partially hidden behind a tree, while Granite stood tall among a ring of celestials surrounding a fading, flickering fire.

                    “STOP IT!” Snow yelled, seeing the same thing and struggling to her feet. “STOP!”

                    Silver ran as well, noticing Violet hurrying beside but not outpacing her. “DON’T!” she shouted. “No one has to die!”

                    Less than five seconds, certainly. That’s about how long it took Silver and Violet to pass by the slower Snow and arrive at the ring of celestials. Once they arrived, they would be able to stop it. Do something. Grab Granite and pull him out of place? Convince all the angels to hold off? Physically intervene and reflect whatever killing intent would be used?

                    It only took Zeal three seconds to look back and speak.

                    “That is not your decision to make.”

So bright that Silver had to bring her arm up to shield her eyes, blinking away a brilliant afterimage. When the light faded enough that she could see again, Granite had collapsed onto the circle of burnt grass. Several celestials fell to the ground, winded and still visible. Zeal exhaled with an air of finality. And what remained of Purity was nothing but a softly fading fragment of some distant cosmic melody.

                    “Y-you didn’t...” Silver slowed to a stop, kneeling next to Granite and checking his breathing almost on autopilot. Alive, for now. “Why didn’t you stop...?”

                    “LIAR LIAR I HATE YOU!” Snow had caught up by now, crying and flailing at Silver with weak punches. Violet stepped in to pull her back, taking a few glancing hits before restraining her to sob into the grass.

                    “Zeal,” Silver breathed, looking up at the ring. “All of you, actually. Why?”

                    “You already know,” he answered with an unusual edge of gentleness. “To stop the corruption, all acts are justified.”

                    “... But, s-she didn’t <em>do</em> anything to us,” Silver protested, gesturing half at the burnt ring of grass and half at Snow and Violet.

                    “The vessel is unharmed and will recover, as you requested. A dark spirit has been destroyed. A heroic victory has been wrought. Now, why don’t you verify if any other vessels have been broken today?”

                    He vanished. One by one, the others did too. Vanity was one of the last to go, avoiding Violet’s eyes and staying silent to her questions before fading out of sight.

                    “...”

                    She checked on everyone. What else was there to do?

Granite was utterly exhausted and had a slight fever, but would live. Strawberry had survived without critical injuries and had spent the last few minutes crawling around to seal as many terrible wounds as she could with her pink shields. Onyx was awake before long and able to help tend to the many, many burns - apparently his signature magic involved electricity, so he was familiar with this type of injury. Similarly, Mocha wasn’t severely hurt and could help Onyx.

                    Lapis wouldn’t wake up. The entire left side of her body was charred, the skin cracked and flaking off. Her hair had half-burned away, and her eye-

                    Silver had to pause and look away. She was still alive, but only barely.

                    It was getting harder to find anyone else as her search broadened towards the edges of the park. Someone was talking with the firefighters who had arrived earlier. Probably Granite. There were still three people to find. There weren’t many places left to look.

                    Finally, Mocha (who had joined her in the search) found Moss impaled on a charred branch halfway up a tree. Blood flowed steadily towards the ground and the branch broke off as soon as they touched it, leading to a macabre scramble to catch him. The wound was critical, but with Strawberry’s last dregs of energy, they managed to seal it to prevent any more bleeding. Still, it was unclear whether he would live through the rest of the day. Granite led in a pair of regular paramedics, as this was beyond what any of the heroes present could handle on their own.

                    Two left. They reached the borders of the park. Only one more circuit and they would have searched everywhere.

                    “Ah...”


                    Partially embedded inside a shattered tree trunk, Mahogany was pinned on top of Maroon by an entire second tree. Blood had already pooled and charred in extreme heat. Everything was covered in ash. More than any other injury so far, this looked <em>really</em> bad.

The tree had pierced <em>through</em> Mahogany and crushed most of the second hero’s torso; there was nothing they could do. But Mahogany had his shifting abilities; he had regrown an entire leg just recently! If anyone could survive having a tree jammed through... h-his entire abdomen...

                    “Help me move this,” Mocha said urgently, but carefully neutral. “He can’t shift with it in there.”

                    It was really, really stuck. Silver couldn’t get enough leverage to budge the tree for a reflection to be of any help - friction sapped any energy before she could get a chain reaction going - and Mocha’s signature magic was “based on radiation,” he said, and wouldn’t be of any help. He could only try to move the tree manually, and it was far too heavy for even both of them together.

                    “M-maybe Granite can help,” Silver suggested. “With his rock magic...?”

                    “I’ll get him. You stay here.” Mocha sprinted away without time for discussion.

                    Something shifted.

                    “Heyyy, Sil...” Mahogany’s voice was weak; more like a whisper. “Guess I fucked up a bit, huh?”

                    She shook her head, still trying to get the tree to move even a little. It was like they had fused together somehow. “Don’t say that. Mocha’s gone to get help. You’ll be okay...”

                    “I don’t think I’ve got it in me to fix... such a big hole... even ‘f th’tree wasn’t...” His speech slowed; Silver had to get even closer to hear him.

                    “We’ll... we’ll think of something! Even if it’s just temporary to give you time to-”

                    “Listen... Sil, you got the right head for this. Justice... but also love. S’cheesy, but s’important...”

                    “What do you mean...?”

                    <em>Scene 74</em>
                    “Move, please.” Silver stepped aside without protest, making room for Granite to briefly inspect the tree. “I can move it, but it will probably break. Can you two protect him?”

                    Nods. No words. Silver and Mocha moved around behind the shattered tree. She prepared to reflect any stray fragments; he prepared to catch any falling heroes once the pinning tree was removed.

                    Granite pushed a large column of rock out of the ground, crashing through the main part of the sideways trunk. Splintered wood sprayed in multiple directions; a huge segment of trunk slammed into the broken street. He breathed; moved a little closer. A smaller spire; a little more precision. More broken wood. Step closer. Again. Smaller. More precise. One more time.

                    The tree became unstuck and with a single loud crash, it finally fell away. Mocha leapt into the debris as Silver kept the fragments at bay. Mahogany could shift again. Could seal that terrible wound. If he had the energy. If he had the focus. If he was awake.

                    If he was alive.

                    “...” Granite felt for a pulse; for breathing. “He’s not gone yet,” he breathed with a surge of relief. “But I don’t know how long he’ll stay that way without help. Mocha, help me stop this bleeding; Silver, find those paramedics from before. West side.”

                    She ran off.

                    At this point, it was only the emotional enhancement from her battle form keeping her coherent. Silver located a second ambulance crew and led them back to the fallen tree. Mahogany was still unconscious, but Granite and Mocha hadn’t given up yet, so there must still be some hope. She couldn’t do much there besides just get in the way - she had no magical healing abilities and no medical training - so she returned to the fountain in the center of the park to sit down, calm down, and think about what had just happened.

Strawberry and Onyx were too, but the former was nearly unconscious due to how much energy she had expended and the latter was busy a bit away helping tend to the worst burns.

                    “How’s she doing?” Silver asked Violet, just because it felt like she had to say <em>something</em> even though she’d much rather just pass out and not have to think about anything.

                    “Fine.” Snow was sitting against the fountain, knees to her chest and face hidden from view. She wasn’t restrained anymore, but she wasn’t moving anyway. “... Are the last two okay?”

                    “...” Silver copied Snow’s pose. It felt a little safer like this, blocking out the world just a bit. “No. Maroon’s d-dead, and Mahogany’s... almost the same.” Her throat felt thick, like she was about to cry. Saying it aloud...

                    “S-sorry.”

                    A long, drawn-out pause. Firefighters and police officers hurried here and there. No one bothered the heroes. “I hate this,” Silver finally said, forcing the words out like they were barbed. “Why are we even here? What was even the point? According to her, there might not even <em>be</em> a point! And all this for nothing...”

                    “It’s... not what I thought being a light side hero would be like,” Violet admitted quietly.

                    “Me neither!” Silver choked on her words and suddenly found her eyes wet with tears. “It never feels like we’re doing anything good or heroic! Maybe with the monsters sometimes, but they just come back the next day. And these ‘dark spirits’ that create them - they’re just celestials too! If angels can be like <em>that</em> and demons can be like <em>this</em> , then what’s even the difference?! What’s the <em>point</em> of all this? The ‘wellspring?’ Some sort of ‘corruption?’ No! One! Ever! Explains! ANYTHING!”

                    “It’s just, what’s the point of being a hero if you’re still hurting people, right?” Violet looked over, but Silver still had her eyes closed. “I don’t think I would have changed if I knew it’d be like... this.”

                    “If the me right now was the me who met Zeal for the first time back in June, I’d tell him to go away and never come back.”

                    “... What about the you right now and the Zeal right now?”

                    “He’s not even here,” Silver knew without looking up. “But if he was...”

                    Would she quit? Right on the spot? It was tempting, but somehow, despite everything, Silver still knew her answer.

                    “No,” she sighed. “I feel like I’m close to finally understanding what’s going on. And once I do, I can finally stop it. <em>Actually</em> help people. And stop all this pointless fighting.”

                    “How noble.”

                    Silver looked up. That wasn’t Violet’s voice.

                    “But how very boring.” A muscular guy in a black t-shirt casually walked towards the fountain, hands in his pockets. “You sappy morons just don’t <em>get</em> it.”

                    Her heart rate just about doubled. Silver shot to her feet, near-instantly transitioning from despair to panic. Ghostly white eyes with just a hint of yellow-orange glow. She hadn’t met him before, but she <em>absolutely</em> knew who he was. “---”

                    “Speechless, huh? Keep trying.” He sauntered past Silver, angling for the still-curled up Snow leaning against the fountain. “Hey, tiny. Get up. You’re comin’ with me.”

                    She didn’t raise her head, just shaking it instead.

What have you chumps been up to?” He shrugged; rotated his shoulders a few times. “Welp, better kill her too real quick.”

                    Silver had to do something. She couldn’t just stand here and let this guy do whatever he wanted. There had been too much pain and death already today; it just wasn’t FAIR that he showed up now too! But what could she <em>possibly</em> do against the monster who could fire streetlights like bullets and crush entire buildings without breaking a sweat? How could she possibly keep <em>anyone</em> safe?

                    <em>Scene 75</em>
                    “S-Snow,” she exclaimed, finally finding her voice. “You said you didn’t want to hurt anyone - look what he’s about to do! If you know him, stop him!”

                    Snow shook her head again, only squeezing into a tighter curl if anything. She didn’t say a word.

                    Umber laughed, just once. “You think she’s gonna help <em>you?</em> After what you just did? Yeah, good luck with that one.” He reached down to pick up a smooth pebble from the ground around the bench, littered with many such stones. “Sit tight; I’ll be outta your hair in a minute or two. At least, unless you want to try your luck fighting back?”

                    A grin. He wanted her to start something. And - as he lowered his arm to point the rock straight at Strawberry’s barely-conscious form - Silver knew that despite Zeal’s warnings, he would succeed.

                    She stepped in front of him.

                    Violet reached out, as if to pull her back, but Silver took another step further away. “Get everyone else out of here,” she said with more calm than she felt was possible. A brief gesture in Strawberry’s direction. “Her first. I’ll deal with him.”

                    “You can’t - didn’t you hear what happened to-”

                    “Go!”

                    Another hesitation, but she went. Umber cackled, turning his attention to Silver. “Damn, what a turnaround,” he complimented. “From frozen stiff to all ready for a fight in, like, a minute?”

                    “...” She didn’t respond, just shifting to keep an eye on that rock in his hand. Her reflection had to be perfectly timed and perfectly aimed.

                    “Although...” He peered a little closer. “Think I’ve heard’ve you. Zeal, was it? You’re his vessel? Silver, right?”

                    “...”

                    “Boring,” he shrugged. “You were doin’ good for a minute there. Fine, I’ll just take care of you first. Try to at least make it interesting, will you?”

                    Umber raised his hand and released the rock. In an instant, it accelerated like a bullet from a gun, tearing across the space between them too fast for any human to react.

She timed her reflection against his hand’s motion, sending it ricocheting off her chest - just between her heart and collarbone, it would have undoubtedly been a fatal wound - right back at him. Well, sort of. Though she had gotten the timing just about perfect, her angle was slightly off. The rock shot between Umber’s upraised arm and his side, cracking into the side of a building bordering the park.

                    He lowered his arm, flashing a brief expression of surprise. Then, a <em>deep</em> grin, followed by a much louder laugh. “Ha! Interesting, I see. You’d better not disappoint, then. Let’s see what you’ve got.”

                    Umber tapped his knuckle against the fountain with a muffled thunk, easily tearing the entire thing out of the ground to rain down dirt and water on a surprised Snow. She scrambled to her feet to get out of the way before hundreds of pounds of stone and water accelerated rapidly towards Silver.

                    This was what she had been afraid of. Pebbles, she could reflect. It had taken a toll to do the last one with how fast it had been going, but she was still fairly fresh and could do many more. But a whole fountain, moving this fast? Silver threw herself forwards and aside, trying to duck under it, but the highest tier clipped her shoulder as she passed, reflecting it on a wobbling course into the air and her ungracefully into the dirt as she split the momentum to avoid overwhelming her reserves.

                    “Less impressed,” Umber noted. The fountain flattened a tree behind Silver, sending a wave of water across the park. Had Violet not already picked up Strawberry, she would have been crushed beneath the stone. “Don’t you have any attacks? You’re making me do all the work.”

                    “...” She was still picking herself up from the grass, trying to come up with any sort of plan beyond just stalling.

Fine; I’ll bite.” A quick swish across the grass with one foot led to a strip of sod rolling up into a coil, aiming directly for her.

                    This one was too fast and too wide. She couldn’t fly or jump particularly high; she ran towards it. With an outstretched arm to reduce the area of impact down to a point, Silver reflected the soil’s motion separately, envisioning it as a clump of dirt rather than a cohesive whole. A spray of broken grass and earth shot from the roll, extending in size as Silver leapt through the hole while reflecting just enough to fit her body through.

                    Another inelegant landing, but she got up quick and ran for Umber. She didn’t have much of a plan, but it was pretty clear she wasn’t going to win this fight by just playing defensively. All of his attacks carried so much speed or weight that she’d tire herself out in only a few more minutes at this rate.

                    “Hmph.” Umber stomped into the decorative stones beneath the bench, raising hundreds of little rocks into the air before sending them all cannoning towards Silver. “How many can you deal with at once?”

                    A lot, but not that many. Rocks deflected off her body, bouncing back towards and occasionally colliding with their fellows. Quite a few escaped the onrushing cloud, or missed her entirely, screaming off in random directions to impact trees, buildings, or bystanders. At least a handful definitely hit Umber, but they just bounced off. And each new reflection required a significant amount of energy due to how much speed she had to cancel. A few, no problem. Dozens, manageable. <em>Hundreds...</em>

Her trajectory changed in an instant, abruptly reversing with speed that would have broken every bone in her body had the rules of force and acceleration applied to whatever logic fueled her magic. Rushing air tore at her, whipping any loose hair or fabric into a frenzy. The park passed in a blur as shockwaves filled her ears, but she hardly even had a moment to consider what would happen next. All she knew was that she <em>had</em> to reflect again whenever she hit something, or she’d instantly die.

                    A wall exploded.

                    Silver fell to the ground, utterly spent and surrounded by scattered rocks and debris. She had reflected all her momentum into the wall of whatever unfortunate building she had collided with, which had resulted in - !! Silver half-scrambled, half-limped towards the street as the roof - now unsupported by the missing wall she had essentially annihilated - collapsed and took the remaining walls with it. A sturdy brick or concrete structure now lay in ruins before her.

                    Umber. Where the hell was he? Silver trembled with exhaustion and adrenaline, unsure how much energy she had left to fight. It couldn’t be much, surely. Had everyone else escaped by now? Could she run? Dare she return to the park to check? Where had Snow gone in all the chaos?

                    <em>Scene 76</em>
                    “...” Despite the churning fear and multiple warnings that told her this could only end in disaster, she just couldn’t leave her friends behind. If anyone was still being threatened by Umber, she had to help them. That’s what being a hero was about. <em>Should</em> be about, at least. What she could <em>do</em> about it was unclear, but...

                    Silver pushed herself into a shaky jog and returned to the park. There was an obvious path of cracked concrete and torn-up grass leading straight back to the former location of the fountain, just another indication of how unbelievably fast she had been moving only a minute ago. No one was nearby, whether hero, villain, or civilian, but she still had to check the rest of the park. Or at least the little temporary area where Onyx and Strawberry had been treating the others. And that was on the other side of the wide-open area in the center, destroyed by two battles in a row.

                    She slowed to a stop. Umber was still here.

                    He was talking on his phone with one hand, seeming quite annoyed at whoever was on the other end, while holding Snow’s hand with his other as she stood with head bowed and hair covering her face. She seemed unharmed, though covered in dust and water from the broken fountain. Silver briefly considered trying to hide, but there wasn’t anywhere to go and it was too late anyway. Umber noticed her quickly, made some excuse to the person on the phone, and ended the call.

                    “You’re back,” he observed neutrally. “What, you got a death wish or something?”

                    “Where’s everyone else?”

                    He shrugged. “Who cares? I got who I came for. But I could always finish our fight from earlier, since you came all the way back here.”

                    “... Why are you doing this? What are you going to do with her?”

                    “Found your voice, huh? Boring questions, though. Maybe I’ll answer if you manage to beat me!” He couldn’t quite hold back a cackle at the end of that sentence. “Yeah right. You can’t.”

Think; <em>think...</em>

                    “Lost it again. Maybe I should just-” He glanced down with a sigh, then reached into his pocket to retrieve his phone again. “Hold that thought.”

                    “Snow, please,” she tried again, beginning to retreat while Umber was distracted. “I know I couldn’t save her, but he’s only going to cause even more death.”

                    “Shut up, I’m on the phone here,” he complained. Then, to the person on the other end, “Mm hm. Fine, whatever you say. I said fine; you don’t have to say it again. Yeah, in a bit.”

                    He hung up. Snow still hadn’t reacted to Silver’s words, so she had started speeding up the retreat. With her friends clearly not here and Snow obviously not listening, there wasn’t any reason to stay and give Umber the chance to decide he really did want to finish their fight.

                    “Hey, you!” he yelled. “Death-wish reflector girl!”

                    Hesitantly, Silver looked back.

                    “Yeah, you’re on the list now. You gotta die.”

                    A cold shiver of fear pulsed through her body. “W-what list...?”

                    “Who the hell cares?” he grumbled, slapping a lamp post on the way past to fling it into the air. Snow stumbled along behind him, having to partially jog to keep up as he pulled her by the hand. “Sick of all these questions and orders and stuff. Just get dead so I can move the fuck on with my day.”

Silver started to move out of the way, but her body seemed to react in slow motion - instantly, she knew she wouldn’t be fast enough. Mustered her energy for a reflection, but felt a resistance as she pulled ether from the extremities of her form. She was already running on empty and this thing was so much larger than any of the rocks from before.

                    In a surreal, fragmented moment, Silver seemed to watch herself from the outside.

                    The lamp post impacted her body just below her ribcage. A burst of desperate energy; a spray of torn metal and fabric as she poured everything she had into the reflection. The pole crumpled in on itself as only part of its mass rebounded towards the rest of it. It split like a banana peel, tearing apart and sending scraps of broken metal in all directions. Blood arced into the air.

                    Silver fell to her knees, shaking with exhaustion and pain. The more solid, armor-like part of her dress around her torso had cracked apart from the impact and slow, thin streams of blood trickled from broken skin beneath. Metal shards stung from where they had cut or embedded in her limbs or face. She was so winded she could barely breathe.

                    Her outline flickered; shifted. She couldn’t hold it together and her battle form collapsed, leaving just plain old Bria on the grassless, debris-strewn dirt.

                    Umber approached; crouched beside her. “Boring,” he whispered. “She told me you were dangerous, you know. But I don’t see it. Maybe you bounced a few rocks, but that doesn’t mean you can stand up to <em>me.</em>”

                    “...” She couldn’t get enough air to speak. Something was definitely broken inside her chest.

                    “Welp,” he said at a more normal volume, standing back up. “No point in sitting around gloating. Better get on with it.”

                    Someone tugged at his hand.

                    “Hm? Really, tiny? <em>This</em> is where you draw the line?”

                    She squeezed his hand; pulled him away. Umber didn’t budge. “You don’t have to...”

                    “I very much fuckin’ do,” he corrected her. “God <em>damn</em> why is everyone being so pushy today? Fighting back’s one thing, but the constant complaining...”

                    He picked up a rock with his free hand.

                    “Don’t!”

                    “Get out of my way.”

                    “No!”

                    “You really push your luck sometimes, tiny. Get. The <em>fuck.</em> Out of my way.”

                    Snow shook her head.

                    Umber half-sighed, half-growled. Then, he picked her up with one hand and bodily threw her out of the way. Snow tumbled to a stop a dozen feet back, dizzy and covered in dirt.

                    “No more distractions. Die.”

                    The rock fulfilled its purpose. Blood painted the ground. Snow had to look away.

                    “Let’s go,” Umber sighed, turning around to pull Snow back to her feet. “Don’t look so goddamn sad; you didn’t even know this one.”

                    ...

                    Later that evening, Snow sat against the wall and rotated her bracelet around her wrist, over and over again. Technically, she wasn’t transformed at the moment so she had a different name, but that “normal” name hadn’t felt real in months. So, Snow.

                    Water flowed through pipes in the wall. Umber was taking a shower down the hall, but Snow was already all clean and nestled in her fluffy, comfortable robe. He always made sure of stuff like that; that she could shower first or choose what slice of cake she wanted or get new clothes more often. At home, he really was nice to her.

                    She spun the bracelet again. It bumped against that protruding bone opposite her thumb and stopped quickly. Why couldn’t he be like that all the time? Why couldn’t he see that he wasn’t doing the right thing?

                    Snow took the bracelet off and looked through it around her room. Dark; she hadn’t turned on any lights yet, so the only illumination was from the hall and the window. There were numerous tiny, precise glyphs carved all around the band, but she didn’t know what any of them meant. Purity had said they were just decorative, but she didn’t fully believe...

Purity was gone. They had killed her, just like she had worried would happen. Snow, of course, hadn’t been able to help at all. Her powers didn’t work like that. And once her angel had returned to the ether, there wasn’t a single thing Snow could do to put her back together again. No amount of her healing magic could reverse death, whether human or celestial.

                    And yes, she had tried.

                    “...”

                    A soft push off the wall let her flop onto her back, staring vacantly at the ceiling. She had been so stupid earlier, she realized. Unbearably so; she had been overwhelmed by emotions and just. Didn’t. Think. When Umber told her to get out of the way, she - she should have just done it. Moved back a little bit. Stayed close enough so that she could still reach out and - and... and what? Heal the wound <em>as</em> it shot through? Umber would have noticed; he wasn’t stupid. But maybe if she had just been careful, or distracted him, and made sure...

                    No. It wouldn’t have worked. Snow had to believe that, or she’d go mad. There wasn’t anything she could have done today, or yesterday, or last week, or any other time. She <em>had</em> been doing something - she had been working with Purity on the homunculus. The artificial vessel. The thing that would make it so the celestials wouldn’t need humans anymore; so they could leave earth alone and fight their stupid fight somewhere else.

                    It wasn’t a perfect solution, but it was the one she could help with. Her abilities allowed her to make incredible progress in creating what was, essentially, artificial life. Combined with Purity’s understanding of the mechanics behind it, they couldn’t have been more than a few weeks away from completing it.

It vaguely occurred to her that she was probably the only human on the planet to really know what the celestials were doing. That mean girl who tackled her had known about the wellspring, but...

                    Snow smoothed her hair, rubbing at a specific spot just above her ear that still tingled with phantom pain sometimes. She could heal her own memories after Malice erased them, breaking the sole condition under which Purity had been allowed to bring her to the upper world. Maybe... maybe she could heal her own grief, too. Maybe she could heal her stupidity away and come up with some way to fix everything. Maybe, if she got the spell just right, she could still reach into the ether and pull Purity back out.

                    She shook her head, accidentally thunking into a bedpost and squeezing her eyes shut in pain. No, she couldn’t think like that. Death was final; trying to hold onto impossible hope would only lead to more pain later. Plus, her powers would probably stop working soon anyway. With Purity gone...

                    Scenes from earlier in the day drifted behind her closed eyelids; she gasped and opened them again, locking her gaze on the reality of her room. Snow wasn’t used to violence. Her powers didn’t include anything that could be used to hurt anyone, not even unattuned magic. She could <em>only</em> heal, so she never found herself in a battle. Not until today, at least.

                    Maybe... maybe that idea of healing her own grief wasn’t such a bad plan after all. She got up onto her hands and knees and started patting the carpet for the bracelet, locating it after a few seconds. It would probably drain the last magic she could spare, but... well, if it worked, she wouldn’t have to care. Maybe she could go even further, healing away all her capacity for misery.

                    “...”

After all, she never could heal away her brother’s anger or desire to fight and kill, no matter how much she tried. All she could do was clear away Midnight’s mental shackles, but it was never enough to get him to disobey anyway. And if she couldn’t fix him, she certainly couldn’t fix herself.

                    She put the bracelet back on. Transformed. Tried it anyway: tried to clean up her feelings and wipe away the images she saw when she blinked.

                    Of course, it didn’t help. There was no “injury,” no matter how much it felt like one.

                    Someone knocked on her door. “You awake in there?” Umber asked gruffly. She hadn’t even noticed the shower shut off with all her racing thoughts.

                    “Go away,” she mumbled. “I don’t wanna talk to you.”

                    An exasperated sigh. “Least just tell me if you’re going to school tomorrow.”

                    “...” Snow didn’t have <em>actual</em> school again until September, of course, but she had been helping one of her teachers over the summer. It gave her something to do that wasn’t magic-related, and sometimes pretty flowers to take home.

                    Today’s hadn’t made it.

                    “Fine. I’ll tell them you’re sick or something.”

                    “I’ll go,” she murmured.

                    “What?”

                    “I’ll go!” Snow said more loudly, then trailed off again. “Don’t want to sit here by myself all day...”

                    Umber paused on the other side of the door. “I can stay here tomorr-”

                    “STOP KILLING PEOPLE!” she screamed, surprising both of them with the sudden outburst.

                    It should have been a simple, easy request. But for Umber, it wasn’t. “I can’t. You know that.” Another pause, uncharacteristic of him. “I am sorry you had to see this one, though.”

                    “You can tell Despair you don’t wanna do it anymore. I can protect you from Midnight! We could-”

                    “We could WHAT?! Spend two days on the run before your magic ran out and I had to kill you myself? Hell, without Despair we wouldn’t even last an hour.”

                    “We could get help from the other side. Zeal and them aren’t...” She trailed off on her own before Umber even interrupted her.

                    “Stop living in a fantasy land,” he said in a low voice. “They wouldn’t trust either of us after all this and I sure as hell don’t trust them. And they can’t do anything against Midnight and Malice even if they wanted to. Remember why we’re here in the first place; what got us into this mess.”

                    She couldn’t forget. “Survival.”

                    “The wellspring team is gonna win. They’ve got too much power to lose. And we’re gonna survive by being on the winning team. Got it? Nothing has changed about that.”

                    “...”

                    “Fine. Stay in your room if you want. If you need anything, you know where I’ll be.”

Snow, again, wished that she could do anything to help him understand. He pretended it was just about survival; about keeping her safe. Sure, it probably was, at least to some degree. But really, she knew, he just hated the world. Everything about it except, sometimes, his sister. If all they wanted was to survive, neither of them would have accepted their celestials’ contracts, but they had. They wanted to fight back.

                    It’s just, the two of them had very different ideas of what “fighting” meant and how much collateral damage was acceptable in that fighting.

                    She heard the TV turn on from the other room, muffled through the door. He’d watch sports when she wasn’t around, but would change to something she found more interesting if she came out. He always did.

                    Snow hesitated on the floor, but the idea of going out to the living room like nothing was wrong - like her angel wasn’t gone; like she hadn’t watched someone die right in front of her - it just grated. Tonight, she truly didn’t want to see him. Maybe he’d understand at least a little if she just stayed put all night.

                    But then again, maybe not. Nothing had worked so far.

                    ...

                    “Zeal-”

                    “It was a simple miscalculation,” he explained rapidly, arranging the second metal bar atop the homunculus’ enclosure. “Despair’s vessel returned too quickly. No one knew Purity’s vessel could summon him with such alacrity.”

                    “It’s called a text message,” Vanity said, hanging back near the lab’s entrance as Zeal threw more gear into and onto the container. “Look, I just wanted to know what the plan is. Things’re lookin’... kindaaa bad out there.”

                    “There is no plan,” he stated unceremoniously. “Attend to your own matters however you wish.”

                    “That can’t be true.” She sidled a little closer, but not close enough to get nailed by flying tools. “What’s all this stuff, then? Just goin’ crazy ‘cause you lost your vessel? Thought you didn’t care about the humans.”

I would need months to train a replacement to the same level.” He slammed a long tube of glass into the wall, cracking it in half, and threw it across the room. “A single miscalculation,” he repeated. “It’s over. Attend to yourself.”

                    “So you’re just packing up the guy ‘cause you like him?”

                    A scoff. Good: that was a more Zeal-like expression. “Hardly. I am seeking an audience with the yhvram. The creature will assist.”

                    “Yeah yea - <em>huh?</em>” Vani did a double take. “The yhvram? Like, <em>the</em> the yhvram?”

                    “The one and only.”

                    “It doesn’t talk to anyone anymore! <em>You</em> told me that!”

                    “It no longer speaks to us. It still maintains some level of awareness, however, and it still responds to the old glyphs. With the proper request, it may still stir long enough to be useful.”

                    Vanity gaped at him. “You really have gone insane. It’s - things aren’t <em>that</em> desperate-”

                    “Malice is on the warpath. I had expected her to move quickly, but I had <em>also</em> expected to have a vessel ready to counter her movements. <em>Your</em> vessel has some potential, but she is so far unwilling to respond in the proper manner, and <em>you</em> refuse to push the matter.”

                    “It’s not gonna help! She hates me too now!”

                    Zeal hefted the homunculus, considering all the attached items. “She would be unhelpful in the upper realm regardless. Malice rampages above, while Despair does the same below. Hardly any will remains among those who previously agreed to resist, and even if it were otherwise, vanishingly few of us retain any vessels in any shape to fight. The tipping point has been quietly reached and surpassed while we attempted to recover from the previous day’s ordeal. There is no longer a path to victory without destroying the wellspring.”

                    “And you think the yhvram can do that.”

                    “I know that none of us are capable of such a feat.”

                    <em>Scene 79</em>
                    A long pause. Long enough for Zeal to <em>tsk</em> quietly and return to his packing. Several plans occurred to Vanity during the gap, but none of them would solve the overall problem: that of raw power. It had taken nearly a dozen of them to defeat even a single one of the wellspring-infused celestials, and the feat had almost completely wiped them out. And there were so many more. Malice and Despair: the two most obvious. But beyond them: Fortune, Hatred, Envy - dozens more, and growing by the day. The wellspring’s influence continued to spread throughout the celestials who were less invested in this conflict. At this point, Vani wouldn’t really be surprised if some of their core group began to defect. It seemed so hopeless.

                    The yhvram could settle that power difference. It could destroy the wellspring. It could solve everything, if only it could be awakened and convinced to do so. For if the celestials were “angels” and “demons,” then the yhvram was “god.”

                    “... At least don’t go alone,” she said at last. “I’ll come with you.”

                    “Attend to your own matters,” Zeal repeated for a third time in as many minutes. “You will only interfere with my task.”

                    “Wh-whaaat? Come oooon, don’t be like that! I’m competent! I succeeded at my last mission!”

                    “Which only led to our collective ruin.”

                    “That wasn’t my fault!”

                    He shook his head. “It is too complicated and dangerous a mission to entrust to anyone unprepared. No one else will accompany me.”

                    “...” He didn’t have to put it in such blunt terms, but... he wasn’t wrong. Making a request of the yhvram wasn’t as easy as walking over to its office and asking a question. No, it had been deeply asleep for centuries now, only waking up once - about 90 years ago - to briefly bless the cohort of celestials to which Vanity belonged. Waking it up off-cycle would probably be impossible, and it likely wouldn’t understand any method of communication they had besides - as Zeal mentioned - the ancient glyphs.

It operated on a different scale than any of them and conflicts that seemed important here might be perceived as insignificant to it. History was full of instances where the yhvram refused to intervene, even when it had been wide awake and in its prime thousands upon thousands of years ago. Or, worse still, it might even take the other side. No one yet knew what it thought about the conflict, after all.

                    In any case, even if the yhvram itself was somehow perfectly agreeable, simply being near the entity that was the shared ancestor of every single celestial held a sort of draw. A desire to meld back into it and return to the original ether, as it were. The pull wasn’t impossible to resist with enough discipline, but it grew more difficult over time and it would take a <em>lot</em> of time to attempt the awakening and set up the glyphs and make their case.

                    “What d’you think’s gonna happen to me if I stay here, huh?” she asked, trying a different approach. “Or any of us in that circle yesterday. Malice knows how to hold a grudge; she’s gonna send us all back to the ether as soon as she finds us.”

                    “You can hide. Flee.”

                    “Not forever. They’re not gonna stop hunting, probably ever. This yhvram plan is kiiiindaa the last chance for all of us. So, lemme help with it.”

                    “You would only get in the way.”

                    “I’ll smack you outta the trance if you get caught up in it. You know how annoying I can be!”

                    “Extremely. As you are demonstrating presently, in fact.”

                    “And if I get caught in it, you can just keep right on goin’. No harm; it’s like I wasn’t even there at all.”

                    “...” He looked away. “Ready your gatescribe. We leave imminently.”

                    “Yeeessssss! You won’t regret this!” Vani exclaimed as she double-checked to make sure she actually had the tool on her. Yep, she had thought something like this might happen; here it was.

                    A few minutes passed as Zeal finished his preparations and Vanity grabbed what she could from the shelves nearby. Then, the building shook from a massive - nearby - explosion.

                    “Wh - what was <em>that?</em>” Vani asked, stabilizing one of the shelves that was about to fall over. Debris rained from the walls and ceiling. “They’re not already-”

                    “They are. That was likely the exterior perimeter. Scribe the gate, now.”

                    The gate to this particular realm was trickier than that to the lower world. Vanity wasn’t that good with her scribe and had to keep restarting some of the more complicated glyphs. Zeal, beside her, worked quicker and more fluidly.

                    A second explosion knocked items off tables and caused cracks to appear in the ceiling. The lights flickered and one of them died entirely, leaving the room in a dim haze. “The inner perimeter,” Zeal noted neutrally, completing his gate. A disk of shifting colors formed in the air. “Give me that.”

                    In an impressive display of multitasking skill, Zeal took her gatescribe and finished her gate too, while still maintaining his own with his other hand. A loud humming noise culminated in a third explosion; one of the walls sagged towards collapse.

                    The second disk of colors snapped into place. “Go,” Zeal ordered, passing through his gate. Vanity followed a moment later, taking one last look at the lab. It wasn’t nostalgic, really, but it was one of the last fairly stable realities she would see for a while. Possibly ever, if things went poorly.

                    She vanished, too. Their gates snapped closed, expelling a brief burst of sparks as the realm’s ordinary reality reasserted itself.

                    A few minutes later, Malice entered the now-empty lab.

                    <em>Scene 80</em>
                    <em>August 4th, 2028</em>

                    “I already quit. Stop coming back,” Yumi murmured softly, scuffing her shoes on the already-scuffed linoleum. The air carried a scent of disinfectant, which still made her tense up every so often. She hated needles, and thus hospitals. But today was much worse than just a few needles.

                    “Think it over again,” Compassion said, equally softly despite being inaudible to everyone else in the building. “Remember how much everyone is relying on you.”

                    “That didn’t change my mind last time and it won’t work this time either,” she replied, not raising her voice. The waiting area was quiet. Lights buzzed. Other patients and visitors shuffled or held muted conversations nearby. Someone coughed. “Look what my help did for them.”

                    “A setback is no reason to give up! You’re a hero; you’re peerlessly brave and you fight to save others! Things would have been much worse without you there.”

                    “Tell that to Silver.”

                    A pause. She wouldn’t have been there at all if Strawberry hadn’t called her.

                    Yumi continued. “And you’re wrong. I’m not a hero. I’m not brave. I didn’t fight to save anyone.”

                    “That’s not what you-”

                    “People can lie, Compy.” Yumi met her angel’s eyes for the first time in their conversation. “Just like you celestials. I’m lazy, I’m a coward, and I became a hero because I wanted to be awesome.” She did finger quotes around the last two words, hardly caring if anyone was watching. “If you want a hero, go find Aquamarine or someone. Don’t come looking for me.”

                    Compassion tried again. “The fact that you have these doubts makes you human, not a coward,” she said gently. “There’s no one else I’d trust more to be my partner.”

                    “I’m 16 years old,” Yumi said. “I’m supposed to be worrying about my first day back at school. Tests, crushes, stupid friendship drama. Not - not whether I or everyone I know will <em>die</em> tomorrow.”

                    “The burdens you take on are-”

It’s exploitation. I had a <em>lot</em> of time to think yesterday and you know what? I don’t think you’ve ever told me the truth. Not for anything that matters, at least.”

                    “That isn’t true.”

                    “Where do monsters and celestials come from? What is the “wellspring,” really?”

                    “...”

                    “Even after all this, you still won’t tell me anything,” she sighed. “Go away. I quit. Maybe if you leave me alone, he won’t come back to kill me too.”

                    “Keep thinking it over,” Compassion said quietly. “You’ll eventually be able to make a decision.”

                    “I’ve already made it.”

                    The angel was gone. Yumi stood up; she needed to walk around.

                    The nurse was late. He had said the procedure should take about an hour and a half. It had now been over two.

                    <em>It’s fine,</em> she assured herself. <em>He probably just had something else to do. Or he didn’t add cleanup time. Or he just forgot. Late doesn’t always mean something went wrong.</em>

                    She didn’t believe herself. The churning in her stomach made that very clear.

                    Most of the heroes who had survived the events of August 2nd were now fine. Physically, at least. But two had been critically injured and hadn’t left the hospital or even woken up since. Of course, they were the two that Strawberry had known best. Not that that meant she was having a worse time than Lillian, who... yeah. She should probably check on her after this. But just being here was draining enough that all she wanted to do was crawl home and go back to sleep.

                    “I’m not brave,” she muttered again, as if reassuring herself. “I’m a coward who hates pain and responsibility and just became a hero because it seemed fun.” <em>And now I know what happens when I try to take it seriously.</em>

                    She had organized the human side of the attack on August 2nd.

                    She had killed two people and critically injured two more. Not directly, but it didn’t need to be.

                    Another hour came and went.

                    Eventually, Yumi received the news.

                    <em>Scene 81</em>
                    Somehow, Lillian hadn’t given up.

                    Somehow, she kept up enough of an appearance to stave off questions from her parents. She went to lessons. She conversed at dinner. She got up on time.

                    Somehow, despite everything that had happened, she hadn’t broken. But really, when she thought about it, the reason she kept going was pretty simple: revenge.

                    Or, to think about it like a hero of light should: justice.

                    The wellspring didn’t really matter. Celestials could do what they wanted. Even her own angel-less status and Vanity’s silent appearance on the 2nd failed to add much perturbation to everything else. No. All she had left to do was to make Umber pay for his actions. And by extension, whoever directed him.

                    The only problem was that she had no way to do that. None of the other heroes would be of any help. She didn’t know how to contact most of them. Strawberry refused to help her, claiming Lillian should just give up and quit like she had. Lapis was in a coma or dead; she wasn’t answering her phone, at least. And S-Silver...

                    “...”

                    So that’s why she was over here, walking through a park towards the lakeshore on an insultingly beautiful (but at least uncomfortably hot) summer day. She was trying to find someone who could help her: the most powerful hero in the city. Even now, she still didn’t understand why the celestials hadn’t recruited him earlier. Aquamarine.

                    As a professional and famous hero, he of course had standard means of contact. An email, a form, PR staff. She had tried all that yesterday but had gotten nowhere. So, it was time to be a little more direct. Maybe she didn’t have much magic left. Maybe something terrible would happen when she ran out. But she’d give just about anything to destroy Umber and his nebulous masters at this point, so self-preservation factored in much lower than it would ordinarily. If she wanted to be safe, she’d have taken Strawberry’s advice. But that wasn’t what a hero would do.

                    “Justice,” he introduced himself quietly. “Formerly the partner of one of the bravest, most selfless heroes I have met.” A soft, melancholy pause. “At your service.”

                    “What do you mean...?”

                    “You still burn with purpose. You have not lost yourself to despair or the wan comfort of deciding there is nothing more that can be done. You wish to enact justice. And I wish to help you.”

                    “...” Lillian remembered him now. “He... didn’t make it?”

                    A deep, almost choked “No.”

                    “I’m sorry.”

                    A second passed. Misery threatened to overwhelm the fleeting moment, but was forced back down. “Likewise. I understand that I am not the only one who lost friends. Your commitment is not taken lightly.”

                    A nod of acknowledgement. What was there to say?

                    “My plan is simple,” Justice declared with subdued conviction. “I will be your angel. We will journey to the wellspring. And you will destroy it.”

                    “...”

                    He seemed to notice where they were at this point. “You were seeking out Serenity?”

                    “I... wanted Aquamarine’s help,” she admitted, carefully storing his offer for the moment. “It never made sense why no one ever asked the strongest hero to help. I - I’m pretty sure he could even stand up to Umber...”

                    “He likely could,” Justice agreed, hovering slightly higher as he considered. “But Serenity herself is the problem. She has remained steadfastly neutral throughout the conflict - although at this point, neutrality itself is akin to choosing a side. It is certainly possible that Aquamarine simply has no knowledge of the state of things, if she never informed him. Perhaps, if he knew, he would be inclined to help. But without Serenity’s agreement, even this most powerful of vessels could hardly maintain his full strength for long.”

                    “Are you saying to give up on him?”

It is possible that his belated entry into the fray would create a substantial distraction away from the upper world. But it is equally possible that it would simply draw attention to our attempt to intervene in <em>some</em> way, regardless of where. At the moment, Malice believes herself to be on the very cusp of victory - shaking that belief may cause more trouble than his aid would assist.”

                    “He could help me kill Umber.”

                    “Ah. Is that what this is about?”

                    “Don’t you dare tell me it doesn’t matter.”

                    “I would never. But Umber is merely a pawn - he holds no special relevance in the grand scheme besides that of an enforcer. Defeating him would do nothing but raise the guard of our enemy.”

                    “He needs to pay for what he did. It’s about <em>justice.</em> Isn’t that your <em>name?</em> How can you say it doesn’t matter?”

                    “I never declared such an objection. Merely that the current time is not the correct moment to proceed with such a path. Once the wellspring is drained and the conflict has concluded, justice will be served to the wicked. But to make such a deviation now would simply be irresponsible.” A breath; he considered Lillian’s expression. “Destroying the wellspring is the single greatest damage you could do to Malice’s cause - the true orchestrator of all the tragedy Umber has wrought. Do not fixate on the pawn when the queen believes herself invincible.”

                    “...” Several breaths. “What does ‘destroying the wellspring’ even mean? What would I have to do?”

We will infiltrate the complex within which Malice conceals the wellspring. And then, as I cannot enter its subrealm due to its corrupting influence on my kind, I will provide you with as much energy as I can before you enter alone to release the energy in an explosive burst to destroy it and ultimately end this war.”

                    “You make it sound so easy.”

                    “There is no guarantee of success,” he admitted. “Should we be cornered by any of Malice’s lackeys, it is unlikely we would be able to defeat them.

                    “... Okay,” Lillian said at last. “I’ll destroy the wellspring. But only if you tell me what it <em>actually</em> is first. Plus, I still want to talk to Aquamarine.”

                    “Very well,” he said after a pause. “If that is your choice.”

                    “So.” Lillian felt a little bit more in control again, now that she had set some terms. “What is it?”

                    “I do not know.”

                    “...” She almost didn’t believe the gall. “I guess you’ll have to destroy it on your own, then.”

                    “Wait. While it is true that no celestial truly understands the wellspring - even those who partake of its power - there is perhaps some information that is known.”

                    Lillian folded her arms and said nothing.

                    “It is the core of an incredible power from the distant stars. Its origin, purpose, and true capability remains unknown. We can only say with certainty that it fell to earth slightly over a decade ago.”

                    “Right before when monsters and celestials started appearing to people?”

                    “... Yes. The events are connected.”

                    “Is the wellspring the source of the monsters?”

                    “... In a way. Dark spirits hostile to humans are native to this planet, but the wellspring’s presence has significantly increased the aggressiveness and visibility of such creatures. Still, even that would be of minimal issue with the hero program. The real problem is that the wellspring offers near-limitless power to celestials who allow themselves to be corrupted by its influence.”

                    “There are side effects, then?”

                    “Of a sort. The excessive power wishes to be used, but its very presence harms the global magical climate in a way analogous to the way that introducing an insatiable predator with no natural enemies would harm a local ecosystem. Too much power, but not enough methods to drain it. To maintain balance, <em>some</em> power must be consumed.”

                    “I... don’t think I get it,” Lillian admitted.

They are incompatible with the current system, so they wish to wipe it away and replace it with their own. We, those who remain untouched by the wellspring, wish the opposite. To destroy their source of power and allow the planet to recover.”

                    “... How could I possibly destroy something like that? If it’s so strong just <em>existing</em> messes everything up?”

                    “Intent. It matters little how much power the wellspring can marshal, if it does not do so against you. Humans are below its notice. You will have no trouble, assuming we can reach it.”

                    They were walking towards the lakeshore again at this point, aiming for a small building by a particular dock. Lillian wasn’t fully sure she believed him, but at this point she was so far out of her depth it was hard to judge how much sense that claim made. “What, literally, <em>is</em> it? I-if I look at it, what would I see?”

                    “A pond, I presume. The name ‘wellspring’ is somewhat literal according to those who have seen it, although I of course have never visited to verify.”

                    “And what happens after?” she didn’t ask, instead just staying quiet. The aftermath of all this wasn’t something she wanted to consider at the moment. One goal. Two, by extension. That was all, for now.

                    “How are you intending to speak with Aquamarine?” Justice asked after another minute or so. They were now basically on the lake, watching waves slosh against the shore. “While he certainly frequents this area, there is hardly a guarantee he will be present at the current moment.”

Any villain transforming here, if they knew anything about the city’s heroes at all, was purposefully intending to challenge him. “And I happen to be one.”

                    “I suppose that is true,” Justice mused. “Your partner bond was broken, but without forming a new one, your battle form should still be attuned to darkness, even if its appearance has changed. Very well. Just be careful to explain the situation before events get out of hand.”

                    Lillian became Violet. She kicked something box-like to knock it over, thus fulfilling her villainy quota for the interaction. And then she sat down on the dock and waited. A few people looked over curiously. Some seemed a little concerned; one unpleasant-seeming fellow snickered a little. She didn’t have to wait long.

                    A brilliant blue comet streaked in from the cityscape to the west, resolving into the shape of a powerfully-built man in his late 30s. Untidy brown hair, a thick, wetsuit-like hero outfit, and a glimmering golden trident held in one hand. The man, the myth, the legend himself. Aquamarine.

                    He landed in a surge of water maybe a dozen feet down the dock, standing with the trident angled slightly towards Violet before calling out in a booming voice. “Halt, evildoer. Whatever your scheme, it ends today.”

                    Violet stood up, holding up empty hands to show she was unarmed. Although, of course, that didn’t matter - her powers didn’t require a weapon. “I’m not an evildoer; I just want to talk.

                    Ah. Somehow, she hadn’t expected him to recognize her. Or maybe it was just that she hadn’t wanted to remember it. “It was my fault; you’re right. I can say I didn’t mean to, but still... I did it anyway. I killed those people.”

                    “At least you admit it.”

                    “I still feel guilty,” she continued. “I quit being a villain partially because of it. I still think about what I could have done differently. But... I know I still haven’t done anything to make up for it, really.”

                    Aquamarine wasn’t saying anything, just standing there with his arms folded and the trident staying upright on its own.

                    “I’ll make amends somehow. I’ll do whatever I need to do to make things right. Promise. But just, after everything’s settled down a little; once I’m not needed to deal with this current crisis.”

                    A long pause. Violet fidgeted uncomfortably beneath Aquamarine’s discerning gaze.

                    “Fine,” he said at last. “I’ll hold you to that. What’s this crisis you’re talking about? What don’t I know?”

                    “There’s this thing called the wellspring...”

                    He let her explain. Justice appeared at some point to corroborate some of the information and correct or expand on some points she didn’t quite relay properly. Occasionally, Aquamarine made a brief comment to an invisible presence or asked for a minor clarification, but there wasn’t any disbelief or urgency. He simply listened to understand.

                    “So, this is all true?” he asked at the end, questioning his invisible angel. A few beats as he considered her answer. “A lie of omission is still a lie. We’ll have to talk about this in more detail.”

If someone of your caliber became involved, the region’s power balance would have become unstable. Which, well, is somewhat what we want at this point, but earlier perhaps not.”

                    “You don’t have to make excuses for her. We will discuss it and come to a conclusion. Thank you for bringing this serious matter to my attention.” A nod; the trident collapses into golden light, then nothing. “Assuming you don’t mean to cause any trouble here, I’ll be off.”

                    “Are you going to stop Umber?” Violet asked hopefully.

                    “I am going to have that chat,” he countered. “Only after that will I consider what is best to do. I don’t usually go on the offensive, you know.”

                    “R-right.”

                    “Take care,” he said, stepping back into the air. “Especially if you’re going after those demons. And remember your promise. Once events have settled, make things right.”

                    A nod.

                    He was off. A blue streamer that quickly disappeared between buildings into the city proper.

                    Violet walked back towards the city, too, feeling disproportionately drained. “Do you think he’ll actually do anything?”

                    Justice considered it. “Perhaps. It certainly depends on how Serenity decides to act, and I do not know her well. If they do decide to make a move, it would likely not be today - there isn’t enough time remaining to plan a competent assault. And that pair strikes me as the type to prefer a solid plan whenever possible.”

                    “Is there enough time to wait? Would that be a good idea?”

I doubt it will be within the day, but within the week is possible. Additionally, every passing day allows more power to be drawn from the wellspring to fuel their conquest. In essence, waiting one day for a significant distraction may be a decent option, but waiting one day for no action would be a loss.”

                    “And neither of us knows whether they’re gonna do anything.”

                    “Correct.”

                    “...”

                    “There is perhaps one additional factor to consider.” Justice seemed somewhat hesitant to continue, but did anyway as Lillian (having transformed back) looked up at him. “From what I understand, a certain pair of angels seem to have taken it upon themselves to attempt a harebrained scheme of their own to destroy the wellspring. I have no knowledge of how their journey is progressing, but it is certainly dangerous enough to predict no chance of success and a very high chance of both returning to the ether.” A pause; a sideways look. “How fond of Vanity would you say you remain?”

                    “... Of course she’d be doing something stupid and dangerous.”

                    “Yes, it is almost expected of her. Zeal being involved as well is somewhat less understandable, but I suppose he may feel desperate enough to consider the dangers worthwhile. Regardless, the longer we wait, the greater likelihood both have perished in some way. And, if we wait too long, there is the unimaginably slim but undeniably terrifying prospect that they manage to <em>succeed.</em> I can’t even speculate on what consequences such a plan would have for the planet, beyond ‘severe.’ So, it does behoove us to hurry. At least to some degree.”

                    <em>Scene 84</em>
                    In the end, they left that same day. Lillian didn’t know how to explain what she was doing to her parents, much all the further questions that would inevitably arise, so she didn’t. Just left a note in her room in case the worst happened. Hopefully she’d be back and could remove it before they bothered to wonder where she was.

                    The re-bonding process wasn’t difficult, painful, or drawn out. It felt much like her original bond with Vanity, except without the body dissolution. From a certain perspective, breaking that original bond left a sour taste, like she had given up something important. But from another, it meant getting away from a duplicitous and untrustworthy demon. Her feelings towards Vanity were mixed, but not broadly positive. Not at this point; not after so much lying and having been ignored instead of explaining why.

                    Similarly, the gatescribe rite didn’t take long at all. A minute of carving an archway into thin air led to a shimmering, semi-stable portal. After taking one last look around her room in case this was the last time she’d ever get to see it, Violet stepped through and entered the upper world.

                    ...

                    “Infuriating, isn’t it?” Zeal asked rhetorically as he knelt to examine the broken, partially-dissolved sealing glyph. Without it, the entire chain bound to it would be unstable and likely detonate once activated. Of course it was infuriating. “Make yourself useful and try to find where they went while I repair the sigil, will you?”

She climbed slowly up the hill of loose gravel and debris nearby, wishing again and again that she could be in any of her forms with the ability to fly. But nope; stuck in human form again. Being this close to the yhvram pulled at her essence and whispered temptations to dissolve back into it. Changing her form would be extremely risky under these conditions, and nearly all angels felt the most stable in their human guise. Therefore, at risk of simply falling apart into ether and stardust, flight was not permitted.

                    She grumbled to herself as she scanned the rubble and horizon for any sign of the two celestials that had been harassing them, but predictably found nothing obvious. A magical trace revealed some broken-off lines of power leading vaguely away from the yhvram itself, but they waved untethered like seaweed. Obviously purposefully severed to prevent tracking. “Same as last time,” she called down. “If we’re gonna catch ‘em, we goootttaaa do it while they’re here.”

                    “Implausible. The perimeter is too large; they could attack from anywhere.”

                    “Well what d’you suggest then, smart guy?”

                    The journey to the yhvram’s current resting place hadn’t taken long. The issue had been in setting up the huge and complicated glyph pattern required to attempt to awaken and communicate with it. Zeal knew the glyphs well and Vanity was no slouch, but it still took them nearly a full day to prepare even the first stage with all its complex interlocking chains, precise angles, and custom-built central circle for the homunculus - to be the focus for the rite’s power to avoid liquifying either of the angels.

                    But, as they went around the perimeter to make sure everything was ready to go, they quickly discovered obvious elements of sabotage. A broken circle, a burned chain, a dissolved sealing glyph. Someone else was here, and they didn’t want the ritual completed.

Even the slightest misalignment could cause a constriction of magical power that, at the scale this rite operated on, could easily overload even a perfectly intact sealing glyph and cause the whole thing to blow up anyway.

                    Glyphic magic was ancient for a reason. It was absurdly powerful, but frustratingly precise and just took so much work to get right. Modern magic did away with the giant chains and circles, replacing them with much simpler intent-based systems. Perhaps less able to compete in terms of raw power, but unbelievably easier to manage and so much more flexible. Only angels as traditional as Zeal or as weird as Vanity would have any idea how to use the old stuff at this point.

                    But any schmuck could certainly break it.

                    “Set traps,” he said at last. “Whoever Malice sent is unlikely to be capable of reading glyphs at a sufficient level to determine the purpose. By replacing some of the targeted sections with chains designed to be unstable when broken, we should be able to counter their attacks without having to be present.”

                    “But that’ll mean having to redraw all this stuff <em>agaaaaiiinnn</em>...”

                    “You did not have to accompany me on this journey. In fact, you can always scribe yourself out of this subrealm. If you stay, however, I expect you to <em>get to work</em>.”

                    “Ggghhhh.” She took another moment to complain. “You’re a real taskmaster, Z.”

                    “Get started.” He pointed over to the right, across a vast plain full of interlocking sigils they had recently drawn. “I will finish up here.”

This whole place felt like a volcano, with rough, dry, dusty black stone underfoot and an orangeish haze in the air. The yhvram could have chosen somewhere nicer to sleep. A glance over at it - a mass of distorted haze, light, and mirages of unclear shape and size - didn’t tell her anything. Just amplified that tug again. That desire to return to it. It was right there; it would be so easy to just sorta... walk over.

                    “...”

                    “HEY!” Zeal shouted over the dry, slow breeze. “GET TO WORK!”

                    With a start, Vanity realized she had walked maybe a hundred feet towards the yhvram without even thinking about it. The inner portions of their glyph perimeter weren’t far off now, and the ground beyond began to melt and distort into strange, contradictory shapes and materials. She looked away and scrambled back, preparing to start scribing. Dangerous. Very dangerous. And it had only been a day; the sensation would only get worse as time went on.

                    Faintly embarrassed that Zeal had probably been watching her to make sure she didn’t do exactly what she had been about to do, Vanity got to work.

                    <em>Scene 85</em>
                    It didn’t take long at all to catch the saboteur(s). Just as Zeal had predicted, there was a heavy <em>thump</em> in the distance before he and Vanity had made it even a quarter of the way around the perimeter scribing new traps. The two of them quickly changed direction to hurry back and check on the damage.

                    “It seems it was your sigil that triggered,” Zeal said as they approached, noting the tall arrangement of iridescent spikes and brambles that had burst from the ground. “Perhaps we will be able to perform a minimal interrogation.”

                    “Hope so,” she huffed, out of breath from the run. “I wanna know what she thinks we’re doin’.”

                    They arrived at the bramble spire and rounded it to access the half-obscured control sequence. With that, Vanity could lower the thing towards the ground and peel back a few layers to reveal who it was they were dealing with.

                    “Youngsters,” Vanity declared as two bloodied forms were revealed. “You know who these chumps are, Z?”

                    He paid more attention to this kind of thing than she did. Zeal peered closer. “Temper,” he decided. “And Punctuality. Members of the newest cohort.”

                    “More like Punctured-ality,” Vani muttered. No one laughed. She raised her voice instead. “Yo, pincushions! Malice send you? Why d’you wanna blow up our glyph so bad?”

                    No response. Zeal gave it a try. “Speak or be returned to the ether. My remaining patience is extremely thin.” He touched one of the control glyphs, causing the thorns to constrict somewhat. A grunt of pain; without the ability to change form safely, it was far more difficult to escape the trap than it would be normally.

                    “Why do you think?” one of them yelled. Vanity wasn’t sure who, since Zeal hadn’t specified which was which. “You’re trying to wake up the damn yhvram!”

                    “Okay, so she figured it out,” Vanity whispered. “But why’d she send just these two then?”

                    “Why you guys?” Vani shouted up. “Why not someone more scary?”

                    “We’re plenty scary!”

                    “You’re stuck in a bush.”

                    “Not for long!”

                    The form of whoever was talking stretched like gum, condensing into a smaller volume to escape the thorny grip. All three other celestials present reacted with varying degrees of speed and aggressiveness, trying to stop it, but no one was faster than the yhvram itself.

                    The celestial’s compressed form pulled towards the central mass of lights and illusions, tearing through Vanity’s brambles and leaving bits of essence behind. Stretched into a nearly spaghetti-like strand, the form disappeared into the mass in a matter of moments. Returned to the ether. Nothing remained but a ragged tunnel through the brambles and a small, fading discoloration on the central dome where it had passed through.

                    “Well,” Zeal said neutrally to the one who was left. Punctuality, Vanity guessed, since it seemed way more likely Temper would be impulsive like that. Although it was totally possible the names didn’t fit. “I suppose he was correct. Do you wish to try the same method of escape?”

                    A shake of the head.

                    “Right. Answer, then. Does Malice not consider us a threat of sufficient level to receive pursuit from the likes of Fortune or Despair?”

                    “No! Obviously not; there’s no way anyone can wake it up.”

                    “And yet she sent pursuers anyway.”

                    “Just in case! She’s careful like that.”

                    “Coulda at least sent someone who can read these glyphs!” Vani interjected. “But I guess all the old people who know how t’do it aren’t traaaaiiitooorrrrrsss.~”

                    “Not this again,” Zeal sighed. “None of her minions can think for themselves. If you don’t have anything else to ask, we might as well just send this one back to the ether as well.”

                    “Wait, you don’t need to do that!” the captured celestial interrupted before Vanity could reply. “I can just-”

                    “You can’t very well be trusted to simply leave, and even if you could, we can’t have Malice learning of the specifics here,” Zeal interrupted right back. “No, if you wanted to leave, you should have done so quite a while ago.”

                    “You’re so merciless,” Vanity whispered.

                    “It’s only the logical reality.”

                    “... I guess.”

                    “Wait, what’s happening with the yhvram?!” Punctuality(?) exclaimed.

                    “Not the oldest trick in the book!” Vani rolled her eyes. “Seriously, you-”

                    Something was happening with the yhvram. The outermost bubble of light and images rippled around where the other celestial had just been consumed. Glittering silvery lines pulsed, staying in place while the rest of the being’s “form” whirled around them. The already warped ground surrounding it blinked out of existence; not crumbling or breaking or even vanishing, but simply not being there anymore. A bubble of nothing began to grow.

                    “Woah,” she admitted. “Indigestion?”

                    “Even I know that doesn’t make sense! Let me down and run before that thing kills us all!”

                    “It isn’t growing very quickly,” Zeal observed, not panicking at all. “And the rate seems to be slowing...”

                    “Maybe it’s the wellspring power?” Vani also didn’t seem very concerned; after all, it was all the way over there and Zeal was right about the speed. “Doesn’t like it?”

                    <em>Scene 86</em>
                    “I doubt it.” Zeal nodded to Vanity, as if prompting her to perform some action they had prepared in advance. Which they hadn’t, of course. “Why not see if that experiment is repeatable?”

                    “Ohhhh~. I getcha. ‘Kay!”

                    “Wait! WAIT!”

                    Vanity manipulated the control glyphs. Her brambles launched the second celestial into the yhvram as well. Returned to the ether.

                    Another delay as the glowing mass rotated. Vanity retracted her brambles, since they were now just in the way. “Does it look like it’s spinning faster to you?”

                    “Perhaps.”

                    A few more moments passed. “... Does it look like it’s getting bigger?”

                    “Perhaps.”

                    “So, I think that means ‘yes’?”

                    “Likely. I am, however, more concerned about those silver threads. Have you noticed they are the most ‘solid’ portion of its current form, and are the only portion to stay fixed in place?”

                    She looked a little closer. Sure enough, at the points where the celestials had entered its mass, glittering silver threads floated in gentle starbursts within the outer layer of light. Unmoving, as everything else swirled around them. “It’s a little weird,” she admitted. “Wait, you’re actually worried about those? That tough guy act was actually an act? Now <em>I’m</em> starting to get worried.”

                    “The issue is that the yhvram should be operating on such a high level of power that it should be unaffected by anything we could do to it, except perhaps awaken it with an extreme and specific rite such as this. But those threads have no ritualistic significance; they should not <em>be</em>. Even the top wellspring-empowered celestials are not anywhere close to the same category as the yhvram, and these two were far from the top.”

                    “...” She looked at the threads again. “Doesn’t seem like they’re doing much to it. Look, I think it’s even slowing back down. Maybe it’ll put the ground back in a minute.”

                    “It is possible there is no issue and this is merely a representation of the dissolved or dissolving solid ether.”

                    “Yes. At least, in the ancient depictions.”

                    “Well, yeah. It’s invisible normally. I know <em>that</em>.”

                    “Regardless.” Zeal shook his head, tearing his gaze away from the yhvram. Vani was alarmed to note they had both walked about twenty paces towards it without even noticing. Even Zeal was starting to get affected by its pull. “Repair the sequences we altered into traps. We only have so much time left.”

                    ...

                    “I don’t know what I expected, but it wasn’t this,” Violet admitted after passing through the portal and looking around. “This could be anywhere in the city. Are you sure we even <em>are</em> in the upper world?”

                    Justice led her out of the deserted intersection. The street was seamlessly replaced by a smoothly flowing river. “The upper world here is constructed from the dreams and memories of its inhabitants. There are certainly many locations that resemble the lands below.”

                    “I see...” Violet said, using the better sightline here to admire dozens of harmoniously conflicting architectural and natural styles visible in the middle distance. Now that she was looking up, it became clear there were even some variously sized landmasses floating above the rest of the plane. “Okay, this definitely isn’t the normal city.”

                    “The target lies within that mansion,” he said, pointing out a stately white building atop a massive slab of strangely blurry grey-black ground. From here, it was impossible to tell how large it was, besides “very.” No roads led up the jagged vertical cliff that marked the edge of the blurry slab; presumably visitors were expected to fly.

                    “How am I supposed to get up there?”

                    “I will carry you up the base.”

                    “... How? You’re like one foot tall.”

                    “Not in this world.”

Justice was taller than her now, still with angelic wings but now also sporting a more human-like body to match. If she had known Mahogany better, she might have noticed a certain resemblance. But she didn’t, so she didn’t. Instead, she just silently remarked that <em>this</em> was what angels were <em>supposed</em> to look like.

                    He was able to lift her without difficulty and they flew up towards the mansion. Spliced, almost checkerboard-like collections of themes and places spread out below. From ground level, the realm could almost seem cohesive, but from above, it was clear just how distinct every portion was. Each the result of some individual celestial deciding they wanted a road, a river, or a tree? A style from the city or the outskirts? From one side of the globe, another, or something more alien? Abstractly, the construction was fascinating, but right now it was only a distraction. Right now, Violet hardly even felt like herself, and not like Lillian either. More... not <em>empty</em>, exactly, but just... dissociated?

                    That wasn’t exactly right either. She didn’t really feel like an individual at this point. Just like a tool, or a weapon. But that was okay. She didn’t need to be a person right now; didn’t need to think about anything that had happened recently. All she needed to do was blow up the wellspring. Everything after that would fall into place. She was sure of it.

                    <em>Scene 87</em>
                    “The back,” she decided after a brief delay.

                    And so, that’s where they landed. Justice minimized his form again and hid somewhere behind Violet’s neck, stating “It reduces the chance that anyone will detect me by aura alone,” and basically just left her to find a way in on her own. After all, neither of them had been here before.

                    So she walked through the gardens for a while, heading generally towards the mansion visibly looming over the rows of opaque hedges that broke up the area. Fountains splashed and trickled. A pleasantly cool breeze meandered between grass and trees, spawned from nowhere in particular and heading right back there after its time in the garden. No one was here, and there really wasn’t any sign that anyone had ever been here, aside from the neatly trimmed plants and trails. No seating, furniture, or left-behind items. Just trees, flowers, and corridors of green as far as the eye could see. It wasn’t even a maze, either - although there wasn’t a straight path directly to the house, the way forward was never difficult to find and never presented any obstacle.

                    Unlike some of the side paths, which occasionally sported unsettling-looking vegetation waving in a breeze that seemed perhaps a little more frenetic than the calm, gentle one guiding the main path. Drooping, willow-like trees with blue, feather-like fronds. Straight wooden growths in a perfect circle, curving together into a banana-shaped tube. An oddly swollen reddish-orange fruit or gourd with a discolored protrusion leaking a sweet-smelling substance.

                    <em>Danger,</em> the side paths whispered. Violet believed them. She stayed at a distance.

                    Therefore, she passed through the garden without substantial issue, emerged into the larger, more open patio and lawn area adjacent to the back of the mansion, and almost directly ran into someone in a pale cream tunic.

                    “Gah!-”

I haven’t finished trimming it yet, so you can’t see very well.”

                    “... T-thanks for the warning...?” She noticed they were carrying a meter-long, forked stick. A tiny globe of light glowed between the prongs, shedding gentle, heatless embers onto the grass. Their eyes glowed with the same light from beneath a plain bucket hat. “A-are you... um...?”

                    “I’m the gardener!” the gardener announced. “I keep this place neat and tidy. Well, and I care for the creations that live within it. And you are...?”

                    “...” Violet hadn’t known she would need to prepare a cover story.

                    “Wait, you <em>aren’t!</em> You’re a human!” The gardener stepped a little closer, poking at Violet with the stick. She felt a subtle stretching sensation where it touched. “What is someone like you doing all the way up here?”

                    “Well... you know... just looking around...”

                    “...”

                    She prepared for battle.

                    The gardener giggled. “You’re a funny one. I should probably tell someone you’re here now. Or, I suppose, shoo you away. No one’s supposed to go in there, you know.” A gesture to the mansion, using the stick as a pointer. It made a faint strumming noise as it moved, like a soft string instrument.

                    She prepared for battle, again.

                    “But that’s not very cordial, is it? You must have walked a long way. Why don’t you sit down over there and try some of the shortbread I’ve been making?” The gardener sidled a little closer still, reaching up on tip-toes to whisper into Violet’s ear, as if some great secret was about to be revealed. “I’ve been learning how to bake, you see. Some of the creations seem to like it.”

                    “Um...”

                    “Oh, it’s no trouble at all.” The gardener led her onto the patio, plopping her down in a wicker chair beside one of those round textured acrylic tables that sort of feels like glass and plastic simultaneously but isn’t really either. “Sit tight; I’ll be right back.”

                    “...”

                    Justice didn’t say anything; it was a minor miracle he hadn’t been detected already. The gardener was about thirty feet away, trimming the hedge with their forked mini-glowing-orb stick as they said. Violet looked over at the door they had just used, maybe thirty feet in the other direction. There was shortbread and a mysterious drink in the way of her gaze. Looked kinda good, actually.

                    What should she do?

                    <em>Scene 88</em>
                    Not get distracted by the snacks, for one. They could be poisoned or magical or otherwise some sort of trick. Despite the gardener’s generally pleasant demeanor, she didn’t trust them. Any celestials around here were those corrupted by the wellspring, she knew. The ones who supported Umber. The enemy.

                    But with the gardener so far away and distracted trimming the hedge (burning the hedge? The stick’s method of interaction with the hedge was unclear.), she had a pretty good opportunity to just sneak into the house without being noticed. There was always a chance they’d look over here, but she had magic to help mitigate that.

                    “Shadow mist,” she whispered, directing the shroud into position. There was a moment of hesitation, as if her new light-bonded form was confused how to process dark-bonded magic, but it was only a moment. The spell took effect quickly, blocking the gardener’s sight as Violet got up and hurried to the door.

                    “Goodness, it certainly has gotten dark all of a sudden,” they declared, looking back at the sudden cloud of shadow over the patio. “I do hope my respected guest isn’t attempting to do something silly, like sneak inside the mansion while obscured-”

                    Violet didn’t hear the rest. She had snuck inside the mansion.

                    “Hurry,” Justice advised her unnecessarily. “They could follow at any moment.”

                    “Which way?”

                    “Unfortunately, I do not have any knowledge of-”

                    “Fine!” Violet picked a direction at random.

                    The mansion’s interior wasn’t that of a mansion. The section right next to the garden itself seemed almost normal, with regular-sized rooms containing materials and machinery that might be useful outside, but just one hallway later things had already gotten weird.

                    “Fish? Why are there so many?”

Some of them seemed to notice and swam alongside Violet, staring vacantly with their glassy, fishy eyes.

                    The sound of a door. “Hello?” called the gardener. “I’m afraid you can’t be in here. If you don’t come back, I’ll have to remove you.”

                    Violet didn’t come back. The aquarium theming vanished immediately after a single hallway, instead giving way to a winding, plastic maze of slides and hills reminiscent of an irresponsible number of playgrounds mashed together at crazy angles. There were too many directions to pick, so she clambered up and slid down and generally got herself all lost with the idea that if she didn’t know which way she was going, the gardener certainly wouldn’t either.

                    One of the slides shifted. A wall bulged, fusing with its partner to cut off the path. Violet doubled back, taking a different route. “Don’t make me shuffle the rooms around,” the gardener requested, voice echoing strangely in the plastic tunnels. “I’d have to spend all afternoon putting them back together!”

                    Out of the playground zone. Violet realized she was running along a wall, but gravity didn’t seem to mind. Everything was metal here, with conduits and grating and harsh warm lights casting hard shadows. Empty, dark vents yawned from the wall (floor?), forcing her to jump over them like pits. It was impossible to see where they led. “What should I be aiming for?” she huffed, still overwhelmed by the bewildering array of possible paths to take. None of these rooms seemed like they even had any purpose beyond just being confusing!

                    “It should be a plain white door,” Justice said from somewhere just behind her. “Or at least, one of the entrances should be.”

                    “None of these doors are anything like that!”

                    “We are likely in the wrong locale, then.”

Why had she expected anything else?

                    “Okay, fair warning,” the gardener called from somewhere behind. And ahead, and to the side; the vents carried their voice all over the place. “I’m going to start pulling things apart now, so you should probably stay away from any walls. And floors. And ceilings. And anything solid, really.”

                    “Justice, what does that mean?” Violet asked, not having learned her lesson.

                    “They have likely been granted some significant level of control over the mansion’s layout,” he answered. “It would likely be wise to heed their warning.”

                    “<em>How</em> am I supposed to get away from every solid surface?”

                    “Perhaps a well-timed jump?”

                    “You’re kidding me.” Violet found herself on the floor again, having exited the metal zone. Now, she ran across dull carpet to find herself in a long, wide hallway lined with framed artwork - or, rather, framed paintings of just solid colors? Each hue was distinct and impressive enough, she supposed in the brief glances she could spare, but hardly worth such ostentatious housing.

                    Between all the paintings, about midway down the hall, she unexpectedly passed by a plain white door. Skidded towards a stop; started to turn.

                    The hallway broke apart.

                    Walls, floor, and ceiling separated from each other, flying away and revealing a mass of undulating static-like colors and textures in the empty space beyond. Violet fell with gravity, accompanying the floor into the depths and leaving the wall - and its accompanying plain white door - sailing out of reach. She couldn’t fly; she didn’t have a grappling hook or anything like that. All she could do was plummet into the abyss.

                    <em>Scene 89</em>
                    At least, until Justice returned to his human-sized form and rocketed her upwards on wide, majestic wings.

                    “You brought your partner, too?” the gardener’s voice echoed through distorted, crackling space. “How utterly unexpected.”

                    The floor vanished into a kaleidoscopic inferno. Smoke and embers erupted like a volcano. Justice flew faster. “You saw the door,” he observed.

                    “That way, I think-” she replied, pointing at one of the still-receding walls.

                    “I will delay their pursuit. Destroy the wellspring and their strength should fade.”

                    Power poured into Violet. Ether; magic like she had never known before. It felt like a static tingle over her skin, electric with energy and motion. She was only a temporary vessel for it; this power desired to be released.

                    “This is all the energy I can spare,” he said, seeming suddenly much more tired than seconds prior. “Recall the plan. Detonate the provided ether as close to the source as possible. Save our world.”

                    “... Right.” What else was there to say? He wouldn’t have any further advice, as he didn’t know what she would find any more than she did. All she could do was her best. And hopefully before anything terrible happened to Justice, herself, or anyone else still fighting against these wellspring-empowered celestials in the world below.

                    “Hello!” The gardener appeared out of a twist in the background colors, swiping forward with the forked stick. Justice turned in a tight spin to avoid it, still corkscrewing towards the door. “Much easier to find you when there aren’t all these walls in the way!”

                    “Brace,” Justice calmly instructed Violet.

                    “For what?” she hissed, but the answer to that was immediately obvious as he threw her, full force, out of the spin and directly towards the plain white door. Then, a twist; a flare. He pulled to a stop just before the gardener, blocking their path.

                    “That is the plan.”

                    “Eh?”

                    Violet slammed into the wall a foot or so low, punching through the drywall and earning a severe bruise from one of the heavier studs that stopped her momentum. <em>Ow ow ow ow why is it so realistic ow ow-</em> Somehow, the idea that the wall would just be an amorphous mass of rigid material seemed more plausible than that it would have all the parts of a real one. It was made of illusions and dreams, right? Who dreamed about drywall and insulation?

                    Still, it was handy to have something to hang onto and a convenient almost-seat as she grabbed the plain brass doorknob and finally opened the plain white door. Then, with hardly a glance back at the two celestials and hardly a glance forward at what awaited her inside, she slipped through and shut it behind her. The wellspring awaited.

                    ...

                    <em>August 99th, 9999999---</em>

                    Dizzy. Lightheaded. Short of breath. Violet fell to her knees, her vision greying and sparkling with hallucinated pinpricks of distant light. Something was singing to her. There was so much pressure outside her head it felt like she was going to implode.

                    But she didn’t. Slow, long, even breaths. She wasn’t dying. She wasn’t imploding. She wasn’t passing out or unable to breathe or anything else. It was just an experience like when you stand up too fast, magnified several times over. Ether sloshed around within her lattice body, finally equalizing against the new, significantly-heightened external baseline.

                    Blinking to clear her vision, she looked up.

                    It was a garden.
                    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1389785234144231484 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1389785234144231484><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, July 1, 2025 9:50 PM">9:50 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The plain white door opened into a lush, vibrant space so choked with plants and greenery it was impossible to spot the walls or ceiling, if any existed. Floral, fruity scents drifted and mingled on a warm, humid breeze. Distant rustling and fragments of musical tones competed with the much simpler sound of flowing, trickling liquid. Small streams snaked across the ground in every direction, each carrying a current of unbelievably clear water.

                    A heartbeat.

                    Violet choked, grasping at her chest as her own heart throbbed in response. The sensation faded over a few seconds, but something still remained. A connection. A... synchronization?

                    She moved further into the garden. No, the jungle. It was too crowded and too wild to be a garden.

                    ... The plants weren’t real.

                    Well, they might be, but they certainly weren’t normal. Instead of wood or leaves or the like, these plants were made of glass. Flexible, colored, textured glass, but glass all the same. Reflective, somewhat translucent, and with the same skin-feel as a mirror or window.

                    “...”

                    A heartbeat.

                    Violet coughed again, <em>feeling</em> her heart spasm in her chest. The pain lasted longer this time, and the lingering connection felt stronger. Despite the mounting fear, her heart rate slowed down. Driven to match that overwhelming, all-encompassing beat?

                    She looked back towards the door, now almost obscured by foliage. She could leave, but then what? Fall? Run back towards the gardener? She could also detonate the lingering energy now, but... was this the wellspring? Or just the jungle in which the wellspring was located? A mysterious, unbearably powerful heartbeat certainly seemed more central than this weird, glassy glade. She could seek it out. Probably should, given her mission.

Violet walked carefully forward, pushing through glass leaves to investigate the small pool gathered on the jungle floor here. Was this the wellspring? The heartbeat had felt further away than this, but it was a pool... wait a minute.

                    She looked closer. The water was so clear she could see straight to the bottom, except there <em>wasn’t</em> a bottom. Instead, the pool displayed an upside-down image of a glass city, from the perspective of looking up from the middle of a street.

                    Glass roads, glass buildings, glass signs, mannequin-like glass people. All translucent, so she could see other glass things through them. The sky high above (below?) was a cloudy, rainy grey, and little raindrops pattered down (up?) on the surface of the pool, causing little ripples on this side too. A glass car drove past, sending up a brief fan of more water. The pool splashed a little, disturbed.

                    A heartbeat.

                    Violet stumbled, almost falling as she doubled over against the pain in her chest. The sound didn’t come from the pool; it came from deeper into the jungle. This... glass city was just a distraction, probably. But what <em>was</em> it?

                    <em>Scene 90</em>
                    Didn’t matter. This wasn’t why she was here. Keep moving; that heartbeat had to be it. Whatever it was.

                    Violet pushed deeper into the jungle.

                    ...

                    <em>August 5th, 2028</em>

                    “It is complete.”

                    “Looks good over here too,” Vanity replied, trudging back towards Zeal and the little guy. “Consistent as can be.”

                    “Good. We will start momentarily.”

                    “‘Kay.” She sat down, winded. “Gonna take a little break...”

                    “Don’t get comfortable,” he warned. “The preparation will only take a few minutes.”

                    “Gotcha...” She nearly yawned, then decided she didn’t care what Zeal thought and properly did. Celestials didn’t <em>need</em> to sleep, exactly, but being awake, active, and focused for so long came with downsides. She was, bluntly, exhausted. He was too, though he wouldn’t admit it. And beyond even just ordinary fatigue, the yhvram’s presence had eaten away at their resolve over hours and days, drawing them closer and closer as they finally completed the gigantic glyph pattern that would awaken it.

                    Probably. Hopefully.

                    Zeal traced the metzmatan symbol on your cute, weird, kinda blobby forehead with a greasy off-yellow dust. Your skin tingled. It was already dry, cracked, and bleeding in places from the moisture-free air here, so the powder helped a little. You only vaguely understood what he was going to have you do. Stand here. That was about the gist of it.

                    “What do you think it’s gonna say?” Vanity wondered, staring at the ground but obviously referring to the yhvram. “‘Bout all this?”

                    “It is unlikely to communicate in any language we understand. Hence the extensive description scribed into the circle.”

                    “Okay, but what do you think it’s gonna <em>do</em> then?”

Somehow, it almost felt like you had a sense of the pattern you were standing within; like you could see it from the sky. Every symbol revealed all at once, with this very point the focus for them all. “It will destroy the wellspring. Either that, or we will fail and likely be dissolved into it.”

                    “...” She shifted on the rocky dirt, careful not to smudge any lines. “What happens if we win? I mean, there’s been a <em>lot</em> of people returning to the ether, and it’s not like we’re gonna get another cohort any time soon. Plus, we probably won’t need the hero thing anymore. Assuming we all get along, I guess...” Another pause. “Do you wanna make up with Malice and them?”

                    “What I want is irrelevant. Focus on-”

                    “Like hell it is,” she interrupted, unusually. “You’re, like, the main guy. No one would’ve resisted like this without you. And it’s not... it’s not like the wellspring ones are just gonna go away once we blow it up. I bet they’re gonna be real mad.”

                    “They will fall into line with their source of power removed. A new master contract can be forged to restrict any further deviation. And then some effort can finally be put into determining why and from where this wellspring arrived in the first place.”

                    “... You’re gonna go back to the contracts? You’re tryin’ t’bring back the golden age?”

                    “It is an imperfect system; I am aware. But it is a better option than the chaos of this age’s fading light.”

                    “... I dunno...”

                    You were ready. Zeal rearranged your stance, then stepped back. “The creature is prepared. Sequester yourself in the proper aperture.”

                    “‘Kayy...” Vanity stood and walked a few paces over to her assigned place. Zeal did the same, on your other side. Together, the three of you faced the yhvram. A mass of whirling lights. The ancestor of all celestials. A sleeping deity. Your task was to awaken it.

                    “Activate.”

A pulse of pressure spread from your feet into the ground, then the scribed lines and curves of the sigil in which you stood. Dust rose. Embers ignited. Glimmering lights snaked down the pathways of the enormous glyph pattern, invoking chains and carving out trembling channels in the air above.

                    A long pause as the spell came to life. Magic gathered strength and intensity. The repaired sections held, though lines in a few places grew near white-hot with constrained power.

                    Finally, another instruction was given. “Release,” Zeal said. And you did.

                    From three equidistant points, beams of light speared towards the pattern’s center. Two of them met at your circle, combining at your feet into a single blast of power as your body dissolved under the strain. You died, your lingering will shaping the spell’s direction straight towards the yhvram - and towards the last beam approaching from the opposite side.

                    Body, mind. And, finally, soul.

                    The pattern flared with light and burned to ash, the entirety of its stored power engulfing the yhvram at once. A deific blow, fit only for a deity. And other being would be utterly consumed.

                    Pulverized volcanic stone filled the air and rained from above. Thick, choking dust blocked any physical view. From within their circles of ash, Zeal and Vanity could only wait and hope that their titanic effort had been enough.

                    <em>Scene 91</em>
                    Stones fell to the ground and dust settled. Little by little, the shroud fell away and the spell’s effect became apparent.

                    “Well,” Zeal said. Then, eloquently, “Shit.”

                    Rather, the spell’s <em>lack</em> of effect. The lights of the yhvram continued to whirl and spin exactly as they had before the massive detonation, although perhaps with less nearby ground. It was not awake. It seemed to have not even noticed the terrific blast. The only potential difference might have been a slight reduction in the silver threads where the previous two celestials had vanished, but that may have just been due to passing time.

                    “...” Vanity stepped out of her circle. It held no power anymore; it was merely a charred curve in the ground. She had never before heard Zeal swear (at least, not so crassly by using human terminology), but if any moment were appropriate, it would surely be this one. “It didn’t work.”

                    “No,” he sighed. “It did not.”

                    “...”

                    “...”

                    “So...” she tried to continue after that crushing failure. None of the last several days had mattered. The yhvram would not help them. “What now?”

                    “Now,” he replied, dragging himself out of his circle as well. “I suppose we should return to the upper world and determine a new plan. Flee, hide, or face our aggressors. Perhaps there are alternative avenues available. Or, I suppose, we could submit.”

                    “You wouldn’t give up...”

                    “No, I suppose not.” A pause as he wandered the ashen remnants of the great circle. Vanity joined him, scuffing up the broken lines and useless chains. “A pity Malice hadn’t come herself. This pattern could have been repurposed to annihilate her and any minions brought along. Even with this failure, glyphic magic again proves itself incomparably powerful.”

                    “... Maybe ‘what now’ can be ‘take a nap,’” Vani suggested. “After all this...”

                    “Perhaps.” A pause. “I suppose there is nothing left here. Ready your scribe to leave.”

                    “Right, right. ‘Fore we get eaten...”

                    A pause.

                    “I notice you aren’t either!” she shot back.

                    “Hum. So it seems.” Zeal made no move towards retrieving his gatescribe or drawing a portal to exit the yhvram’s subrealm. Such magic would be unstable at best this close to it anyway, now that he thought about it. “It would be far safer to produce the gate a significant distance away, regardless. Turn your attention towards leaving the immediate area.”

                    “Right. The interference...” Vani made no move to leave.

                    “I notice you are not-”

                    “You aren’t either! Turn around, at least!”

                    “...”

                    “...”

                    A much deeper sigh. “It seems this is likely the end,” Zeal said with remarkable calm. “Observe where our path has led.”

                    It was a straight line directly towards the yhvram. Despite every intention to leave, turn, or even just stand still, somehow every passing second brought them closer to the center. Tiny, sparkling fragments of essence began to flake off, pulled away from their bodies towards the whirling, almost gravitational pull.

                    “No! No; we’re aware of it! It’s not like - we can just...” Vanity struggled against the pull, but every attempt to just turn around led to failure. Spinning in place or even backpedaling towards the yhvram. She looked to Zeal for help. Perhaps the only celestial alive with so much knowledge of ancient magic. Glyphs. Gods. The metzmatan, for yhvram’s sake. “There has to be some way! Why - why can’t I just turn... around...”

                    “It has been too long. And, perhaps that final blast attuned us too heavily towards it. Perhaps the weight of utter failure was too much. Make your peace.”

                    “... I can’t. The - the people I’ve hurt aren’t here. I can’t make it up to them...”

                    A constant flow of glittering particles streamed from her head into the cloud of lights. They were well into the unstable, translucent terrain past the edge of their former glyph circle now.

There is nothing shameful about fighting for justice, whatever the methods.”

                    “...” With a soft poof of golden dust, one of her arms tore away at the shoulder, dissolving into essence that trickled into the yhvram. “I don’t... think I regret trying,” she decided.

                    A nod. “At least you have that.”

                    “At least.” One final pause. “Goodbye.”

                    Vanity dissolved into golden dust. Returned to the ether.

                    One last sigh. “Unbelievable,” Zeal complained to no one in particular. Himself. The world. God, perhaps. “To have it end alongside her, of all-”

                    Zeal dissolved too. Returned to the ether.

                    Unaware, uncaring, and unchanged, the yhvram slumbered on. Dreaming of ages past and ages yet to come.

                    ...

                    Violet had made it.

                    The heartbeat hadn’t killed her yet, though she was trembling in pain from its constant attempts. Somehow, her magic kept her alive. Just enough of a counter to keep her heart beating and not <em>quite</em> falling into sync with the fatally slow background beat.

                    Although it wasn’t much of a “background” beat anymore: she had found the heart.

                    After pushing through the jungle for longer than she had thought possible - and far longer than she would have preferred - Violet finally stumbled into a wide clearing. A pool of reflective, metallic silver liquid shimmered gently near the center. Rising from the pool was a crooked, willow-looking tree with pale white bark and strangely dark, yet reflective leaves or fronds. And hanging from a low, central branch like some sort of strange fruit was a stylized heart made of white crystal. It was about the size of two fists put together.

                    The heart did not move, but it did glow with a soft inner light. Thunderingly loud beats sounded from it. This was the source. The wellspring. She had no doubt.

                    <em>Scene 92</em>
                    But that wasn’t really a question either. The crackling, electric energy from Justice (was he even still alive, out there facing the gardener?) still lingered within and around her. The plan was to release it at the wellspring, and here she was: at the wellspring. It was time to detonate it, destroy the thing, and end the celestials’ stupid war.

                    “...”

                    The pool felt strange. Her blood hurt. Every throb of her heart - whether in tune with that horrible, white-crystal beat or not - brought fresh pain. She needed to finish this, now.

                    Violet gathered all her energy. Justice’s shared power, augmented with her own. She stood on the shore of the silver lake, raised a hand, and aimed directly at the heart. Held one last breath. Releas-

                    ... The colors here reminded her a lot of a certain someone.

                    A moment of hesitation as magic danced across her palm. “... Silver...?”

                    The heart beat. She exhaled in pain, all at once like a punch to the gut. Her aim shifted; her concentration broke. The attack leapt forward: a gargantuan bolt of unattuned magic tore across the moderate distance and impacted... the white tree’s trunk.

                    Not the heart. A portion of its right side was somewhat charred; perhaps a delicate series of cracks spiderwebbed across an extremity. But it was not destroyed. Not even close.

                    Violet stood in stunned silence for a moment, hardly even noticing the throbbing ache in her chest. “Oh no...” she breathed. “No no no not at the very end...”

                    She had simply missed. Violet had never been particularly good at unattuned magic - and her recent lack of practice hadn’t helped either - but it had been the last-second distraction that had cemented her failure. Intent. She couldn’t keep a killing intent when wondering if this tree could possibly have something to do with...

                    <em>“Curious.”</em>

                    Violet froze, her thoughts breaking off unnaturally. A powerful, bass voice vibrated inside her head. Telepathy, but wrong somehow. Twisted. Barbed.

                    “...” She couldn’t speak. Couldn’t move. Could hardly think.

                    <em>“Disgraceful scion of the old order,”</em> it addressed her again. <em>“Your weakness is insurmountable. Your ilk, regardless of provided gifts, are ultimately insignificant. Incapable, helpless. Representative of the lost, pitiful dreams of a faded, tarnished era.”</em>

                    This wasn’t how it was supposed to be. The wellspring shouldn’t have noticed. An answering thought rebuked that statement immediately: she shouldn’t have missed.

                    <em>“Adherents to the past must be swept away. Tainted; corrupted by this golden infection. Dreamers that fancy themselves gods. All who stand with them must end.”</em> A horrific shifting of attention; intent. The heart’s next word was a simple command. <em>“Die.”</em>

                    Her heart stopped. Just like that.

                    Violet dropped to her knees, then fell prone. An awful weakness spread through her body as she felt herself begin to obey the heart’s instruction. <em>Die.</em> It echoed in her mind. Coursed through her blood. Seemingly, scratched itself into her soul. <em>Die.</em> How could she do otherwise?

                    A loose strand of hair dipped into the silver pool. Something happened.

                    The heart seemed to notice. <em>“Unless...”</em>

                    A titanic heartbeat. Like a long-suffering car engine sputtering back to life, Violet’s heart responded and sent her blood pumping again. She choked and gasped, drawing in oxygen to avert an immediate end. She could move. Think. Speak, if she so desired. The strand of hair dipped in the pool had lost all of its color - bleached ghost white within a matter of seconds - although she understandably didn’t notice at the time.

                    <em>“Choose,”</em> the heart boomed. <em>“Die with the old order, or herald in the new.”</em>

                    She could die with the old order. Make a final, but futile, stand against the heart. It could kill her with a passing thought. She knew that now.

                    Or.

                    Submerge herself in the silver pool. Undergo a metamorphosis. Transform, into a battle form of sorts. Serve the wellspring. Ascend, as so many celestials already had. The process, it seemed, was available to humans as well.

                    To submit would save her life. But it would betray so many others.

                    <em>Scene 93</em>
                    She couldn’t do it. She had never been a good villain. To betray everyone who had fought alongside her and sacrificed so much to get here... she couldn’t do it. People had <em>died</em> to give her this chance, and she had already failed to use it. To simply turn around and join the wellspring would be a step too far.

                    But what could she <em>possibly</em> do otherwise?

                    Suddenly, every recent failure seemed to pile upon her all at once. Her first meetings with Silver. Stealing the truck. Becoming that darkness-wreathed monster. Leaving Vanity; trying to be a hero. Failing at that too. Going to the park. Leaving Silver behind. Learning what had happened to her...

                    And now, being categorically unable to make up for any of it.

                    Something cracked.

                    It was obvious. She couldn’t - wouldn’t - join the wellspring. But, right now, she was still alive. One more chance to make everything right.

                    A step towards the silver pool, then a second. As if she were intending to immerse herself in it and submit to the heart. Magic thundered through her veins, drowning out the beats that still throbbed with piercing pain. Don’t miss don’t miss don’t miss don’t

                    <em>Die.</em>

                    Violet fell into the silver pool. The burst of unattuned magic had struck true, but hadn’t destroyed the heart. A faint coating of dull residue slowly steamed away. What had she been thinking, honestly? After all that, to arrogantly believe she held the power to cut down such a presence? Of course, she had never had a chance. Never been good enough.

                    Something broke.

                    Her heart had stopped. Her breathing ceased. Electrochemical impulses stilled.

Of course not; her body was made of a lattice of solid magic. It only acted like a human body because she was conditioned to view it that way. But now, as silver liquid bubbled and hissed against its golden antithesis, what remained of Violet herself had departed. Nothing survived to tell this human-sized, human-shaped mass of densely-packed magic what it was supposed to do. How it was supposed to act. Nothing except a tiny little sigil inscribed on one shoulder only a few hours ago.

                    It was a crude thing, hastily done with only a modicum of skill and little understanding of the nuances of glyphic magic. Two simple glyphs with a single chain to connect them. The proportions were inexact and the angles just barely within the symbols’ allowed tolerances. If Zeal or even Vanity had seen it, they might have ridiculed the artist with varying degrees of sincerity.

                    But despite its amateur nature, the sigil worked. Activated upon the death of its host. Glowed dimly, then brightly with increasing violence. And then, mere seconds after the heart’s utterance, Justice’s final failsafe and ultimate plan detonated. All the magic that made up Violet’s body thundered forth into a cataclysmic explosion with an order of magnitude more energy than the world’s largest nuclear bomb.

                    Perhaps he had never trusted her, either. Perhaps he simply hadn’t cared for her own agency. Regardless, he certainly hadn’t left things up to chance. If he hadn’t been returned to the ether by the ensuing devastation, perhaps he could have explained.

                    As it was, however, no one involved in that final mission - on either side - survived the day.

Above, the damage was singularly extreme. The mansion and all its occupants entirely vanished, as did vast swathes of solidified dreams. But in the end, the greatest loss was that of the gatepillars. Of those seven ancient instruments - crafted by the yhvram in ages long past - that attuned subrealms and powered gatescribes, only two survived. Enormous portions of the upper world fell into the lower, or into the blackness between realms where the destruction was strongest or there was no earthly counterpart. The remaining pillars were so badly damaged that scribes and gates both failed quickly after, stranding celestials above and below.

                    Repair would be impossible without the yhvram, and it did not even stir in the wake of this latest disturbance. Without gatescribes to enter its realm, there was not even the remote chance of a second glyphic attempt to awaken it. Only in the far distant future, if and when it deigned to awaken again, could any mending be done.

                    Below, of course, few were aware of these complexities. No, the first things most people of Earth noticed were merely the initial booming report and the worldwide earthquake. Beyond that, events slowed down. It would take hours, then days, then finally months for the full repercussions to become clear.

                    <em>Epilogue</em>
                    <em>August 5th, 2028</em>

                    Snow woke up feeling weird.

                    The sensation didn’t go away as she went through her morning routine, but it did change a little. It had been sort of a vibration when she first awakened, as if someone had been jackhammering just outside the building, but as time went on it condensed and localized. By the time she realized that Umber wasn’t awake yet and turned on the TV to eat breakfast, it was more of a strange oscillating change of temperature. Her blood ran hot, then cold, then hot again. Uncomfortable and probably worrying, but she very quickly had other matters to distract her.

                    The news was talking about an explosion; an earthquake. Early in the morning here, but apparently causing tremors across the globe. Now, investigators and recovery crews were discovering broken structures seemingly having fallen from the sky. Hundreds of angels and demons had vanished, and those who remained would say nothing of the event. People were calling the structures the ruins of Heaven, whatever that meant.

                    Having at least a vague understanding of gatescribes and the realms from her should-have-been-erased conversations with Purity, Snow could quickly guess that something terrible had happened, though she was at a loss to explain what exactly. When Umber came out of his room, saw the news, and casually suggested they go check one out, she initially declined. When he told her Despair was also missing, she <em>really</em> declined. But when he walked out the door anyway, she only stood there fuming to herself for a few moments before hurrying out after him. She had to make sure he didn’t do anything bad. Plus... she was curious too.

These were enormous chunks of partially-shattered blue glass, shaped into windows and walls and structural components. The corpse of a glass skyscraper.

                    While mysterious, this ruin didn’t offer any of the immediate insight Snow was sort of hoping for and an out of breath cop showed up after a few minutes to shoo them away. Umber was almost ready to transform, but Snow managed to lead him away without incident. Instead, they sat and talked about what had happened and what to do next.

                    Despair was gone. Malice was gone. The gates, Snow (correctly) guessed, were gone. The wellspring was...? Well, certainly unreachable now. Perhaps more.

                    She said they wouldn’t have to fight and kill anymore. He said he didn’t believe that for a second. She said he couldn’t do it even if he wanted to, since he couldn’t recover his magic without Despair. He said watch him. She said it had already been happening to her, since a few days ago. He said no it wasn’t. She said yes it was. He said-

                    Somewhere above, Aquamarine nodded to a grim Serenity as the siblings continued to argue. “Not a threat at the moment,” he agreed. “Though I’ll keep an eye out. And please keep refilling their ether if it gets dangerously low. No one else has to die. Not even him.”

                    “And their instability? You believe that will simply ‘go away’ without issue?”

                    “Not exactly,” he admitted. “But it isn’t hurting anything yet. If it starts to become a problem, we’ll deal with it then. Now, let’s see what we can do for that other one...”

                    ...

                    <em>August 18th, 2028</em>
                    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1393705527715954740 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1393705527715954740><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, July 12, 2025 5:28 PM">5:28 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Yumi had had a very bad two weeks. She had spent most of the first week in her room, refusing to do just about anything except keep yelling at Compassion with increasing fury every time she came back to say something about being a hero again. Eventually, her parents made her come out after a long conversation through the door and she spent the next week trying to convince them she wasn’t going to just go back in there if they took their eyes off her for a second.

                    Death, death, death.

                    What finally got her to leave the house for the first time since the disaster of August 2nd was a pretty significant surprise. Someone rang the doorbell, her mom went to answer it, and then came back saying someone was asking for Yumi and said she had agreed to go to the hospital with them. It seemed like a scam or something for a moment, before her mom mentioned the person’s name was Snow and gave a brief description.

                    “What are you <em>doing</em> here?” she asked, walking alongside the person whose angel she had killed just a few weeks ago. “Don’t you hate me for... everything? Or is this just a trap?” Somehow, that idea didn’t seem all that alarming. Did she even have her transformer in case she needed it? Had she left it in her bedroom? Did she even care?

                    “... Kinda,” Snow admitted, looking at the sidewalk. “Er, the first one. It’s not a trap, promise! I... I just, I know why you did it. Purity knew for ages it might happen. But...” She trailed off weakly. “You know, Aquamarine told me to prepare what I wanted to say, but I didn’t.”

                    “Aquamarine?”

                    “He told me what happened. He also beat some sense into my brother.” A quick, almost hidden little smile, but it was quickly replaced by the same slightly sad, slightly worried look as before. “I know I wasn’t the only one to lose someone important in that... whole thing.”

                    “... You can say that again.”

I could have saved... I don’t know. Maybe I couldn’t have. Umber wasn’t listening. Purity wasn’t listening. <em>I</em> wasn’t listening, either. But I could have kept trying anyway.”

                    “...”

                    A measured breath. “My powers are healing. That’s why we’re going to the hospital.”

                    Another pause. “It’s too late,” Yumi murmured. “Unless you can bring someone back to life.”

                    “No. I can’t. I... I’ve really tried, but it just doesn’t work.” A more alarmed tone. “Wait, it’s - s-she was just alive yesterday, Aquamarine said-”

                    “Lapis?” Yumi interrupted. “No, she’s still in a coma. But, er, Mahogany...”

                    “I’m sorry,” Snow repeated. “I could have saved him, if I had just been there.”

                    “...” Another long breath. “D-don’t think I’m not grateful, though. If you can wake her up, that’s... that’s more than I would have ever expected.”

                    “I’ll do my best. If I can help it, no one else has to die.”

                    They went. Snow transformed. She didn’t look any different; not even her clothes changed. They entered. Snow cast her spell. The magic worked quickly and flawlessly, erasing burns, repairing tissue and organs, and even undoing whatever damage had kept Anya asleep for the past two and a half weeks. Within a single miraculous minute, she was healthy enough to leave. Although Yumi would have a lot of painful explaining to do. Snow said her goodbyes, dumped the rest of her healing energy into the sickest patients she could find for good measure, and staggered back home exhausted.

                    She had learned she didn’t have to worry about depleting her ether anymore. Even without Serenity’s help, her body now naturally recovered its own magic over time. Umber’s too, and now - she had just confirmed - Yumi’s and Anya’s as well.

But somehow, some heroes still weren’t like this. Aquamarine, for one, but he was far from alone. There was no obvious pattern - hero or villain, bound to a celestial or not, old or young, powerful or weak - it seemed broadly random who could recover their own magic and who could not. The only certainty - so far, at least - was that every single hero who had ever been bound to a celestial touched by the wellspring <em>could</em>, and that led a number of important people to be very concerned.

                    Snow didn’t know most of that, of course. She was just relieved that she could keep healing people, and that she didn’t have to worry about her brother overdoing it and paralyzing himself.

                    What she <em>definitely</em> didn’t know was that this strange mutation, spread on twinkling, microscopic silver dust that rained down with some of the fragments from the upper world, had spread beyond just heroes. Ordinary people with no magical abilities, possessing real flesh-and-blood human bodies rather than latticed facsimiles, were somehow gaining the ability to generate and regenerate their own magic.

                    Without a body formed of magic, these touched humans could not express their powers in any way, but they could pass on their trait to their children. A latent inheritance that could make its way down generations until finally, eventually, happening across a child with a very peculiar mutation.

                    In time, humanity would become a race of magic. And that led a much smaller number of much more important people to be <em>extremely</em> concerned. But the repercussions of that concern are a story for another time.

                    ...

                    <em>December 7th, 2028</em>

                    The monsters were gone.

As heroes continued to purge dark spirits, they made increasing progress until finally, in early December, not a single incident was reported for the whole day within the metropolitan area. A milestone last achieved decades ago, before the start of the hero age.

                    Some heroes declared they would retire, their services no longer needed. Others pivoted to fighting ordinary crime instead. A handful of villains remained active, so some dedicated themselves to clashing against them. But by and large - and particularly with no celestials bonding new heroes of any type - it seemed the time of superpowered defenders would come to an end with this last generation.

                    No one yet knew about the mutations, of course.

                    Mr Whitman kept his composure as he scanned the girl’s ticket. Thank you, have a good day, miss. But the hair; the eyes; the face... He pulled himself together and continued down the aisle. That girl was not Bria, and neither were any of the others he had seen over the past several months that looked somewhat like her.

                    He and his wife had not been having a pleasant end of the year.

                    A police officer had told them first. Their daughter had been a hero. Killed by a villain earlier that same day. His condolences.

Yumi, the girl’s name was. She had explained what had happened beyond that clinical report the police had provided. Ended up half-crying into their sofa, apologizing for what she had done. It had been an awkward, uncomfortable, potentially even miserable hour and a half. But at least there was a sense of... closure, perhaps? He had started to understand what his daughter had done and why she had done it. How she had been hiding this from her parents for months. The doubts she must have felt... How he hadn’t been there for her. Couldn’t have been, because of how these celestials operated.

                    If the whole concept of heroes hadn’t been basically shattered in August’s explosion, Mr Whitman might have gone out to rally against it himself.

                    Yumi had offered to introduce him to Snow, and perhaps, from there, even to Umber, if he wished. The person who murdered his daughter alongside so many others, and had not - would not - be punished for it. How was that fair? How was it just?

                    But of course, he had declined. To meet Umber wouldn’t solve anything. From what Yumi said, he had already been soundly defeated by Aquamarine for his actions, and his sister was doing her best to help with his rehabilitation. No one else had to die. He was still angry - furious, even - but nothing Mr Whitman could do could bring Bria back. So the only thing he could possibly do was try to bring just a little bit of peace, love, and justice back into the world.

                    After all, that’s what she would have done, too.

                    Hey, thanks for playing! This story’s traditional dead protagonist counter ends up at, uh... Oh dear. By my count, there were ten-ish total protagonists (characters who had more than one-ish scene told from their perspective-ish), of which seven-ish of them met their various ends throughout the story. That’s a pretty bad fatality rate, and was <em>super</em> not the original plan when I wrote the prompt.

                    Yeah, <em>Reflective Silver Love and Justice!</em> was - believe it or not! - intended to be a much more positive story about the power of friendship and heroes of light and dark banding together to topple the system! Wow, that would have been cool. I guess we got something along those lines, with Violet ending up destroying the gatepillars, but it was certainly a lot less intentional than in the original idea. And involved a lot more deaths. Well, that sort of drift is what you get when you write stories piecemeal like this - rarely do I ever get more-or-less exactly what I envisioned when starting out.

                    Instead, I suppose the story’s themes tended more towards deception, manipulation, and the impossible task of fighting back against those dastardly celestials. Hence how a lot of the characters ended up not really knowing the whole picture or dying in sudden, painfully incomplete ways rather than in heroic last stands. That was of course exemplified by our main protagonist unexpectedly meeting her end only about 80% of the way through the story in a confrontation that really didn’t even need to happen. The world is a cruel place, I suppose, but as Mr Whitman decided, that doesn’t mean you can just give up. Always try to put a bit more love and justice into the world than was there before.

                    Business as usual, essentially. I’ve got a few prompts for the next story that I’m quite excited about, and (unusually) I’ve even plotted out a rough outline for one of them in advance! Maybe that’ll help with the dramatic changes from the original plan these stories tend to accrue, although maybe not. Those choices still have to mean something, after all, so it’s not like I can make the plot ironclad. Doing that is called just writing a normal book, not a choose-your-own-adventure story. So don’t worry, there’ll still be plenty of opportunities to mess it all up next time too! :)

                    I’ll be archiving the current <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#story_updates</span> channel and creating a new one for the next story in the next few days. The new set of starting prompts will then be put up soon after that, probably next week sometime. I’m also going on a brief vacation near the end of July, so the start of the next story might get a little wiggly around then. We’ll see how it turns out.

                    As always, thanks for sticking around, voting, and engaging with these stories that I enjoy writing so much - let’s keep it up for a good while yet!
