    Alrighty then, time for some more writing! We&#39;ve got two on the docket this time, which was going to be three until I decided to drop one at the last minute before posting this. I just wasn&#39;t as interested in it as these two, so you get two prompts and that&#39;s it; vote for the one you want! As usual, the one that isn&#39;t picked might come back later, be rewritten, or never be seen again. Without further ado, the prompts:

    [Part of the Nucarreo canon]
    Congratulations. You are the newest member of the Cathedra, the order of clergy and divinely-empowered superhumans charged with keeping the city - and everyone in it - safe. You will be pushed to your limits in Body, Mind, and Soul to serve your greater purpose. The job is difficult and dangerous, but you will wield powers beyond mortal beings, commanding respect and gratitude from those you defend.
    ...
    But where do these monsters we fight come from, really? What actually happens to new Angels during their Ascension? Why are we given these banal or seemingly-arbitrary tasks between combat duties? Why aren’t we allowed into those few hidden locations, even though we are the shining heroes of this city? What is <em>really</em> going on here?

    <em>Near-future - a big city</em>
    [Part of the Kronwae canon]
    You are a witch. You see things that others can&#39;t, face dangers ordinary people never know, and wield powers rare among humanity. Moving to the big city has been a heck of a change; besides the obvious, you also see far more supernatural activity here than your hometown. And that means it&#39;s time to get to work helping people deal with it. Whether for altruism or profit is up to you to decide. Just be careful to keep yourself safe as well... both from the monsters you face and the humans who would use your abilities for their own ends.

    It’s time to descend into a universe we haven’t yet seen. One of steam, divinity, and darkness. Nucarreo.

    Who is our main character? This story will be told either primarily or entirely from their viewpoint, so choose carefully. The information given is only their initial personality and skills; you will have a chance to change certain aspects later with training and experience. The sibling not picked will still have a role in the story (more details in the next batch of pre-story choices), but will not be an Angel.

Thoughtful and withdrawn; a little socially anxious and kind of a bookworm due to an extended illness and quarantine when she was little. Due to required classes for all young girls in the city, she is skilled in reading, writing, math, and other mental arts. Innately talented with magic themed around light and illumination, though she doesn’t know this yet. [Jessamine would make an excellent Angel focused around magic and investigation, though her combat ability will suffer.]

Dedicated but friendly; strongly protective of Jessamine (partially due to her illness) and, to a lesser extent, other young people generally.

Is particularly compatible with Angelic physical changes, though he doesn’t know this yet.

    Man, it’s a good thing you folks picked Jessamine, because I had already guessed you would and put her on the cover drawing. And boy did I not want to redo all that work with Seth instead. I think he will probably do better than Jessamine (with his personality and skills) as a non-Angel as well, so it probably all works out. Anyway, let’s determine a few more details.

    Seth will not become an Angel. So what <em>will</em> he become?

    “Jessamine Laura Goodall,” Father Turner calls, his voice echoing briefly in the mostly-silent church. You scramble to your feet, shuffling past your mom and two other families in the row before emerging into the aisle and hurrying towards the pulpit. Most everyone remains quiet as you walk, white slippers padding on the dull, worn carpet.

    The church is full today, March 1st, the Calling Day for all children who have turned twelve since February 1st. You are one of them, your birthday falling on February 20th and making you finally old enough to know your future path. You - and every other child to be Called today - are wearing pure white tunics and pure white slippers, the better to display your own purity to God. You were careful to be on your best behavior for the last month and you followed the preparatory instructions perfectly. You are as ready as you can be, and everyone else in the church is here to support you.

    Still, you’re nervous. How can you not be? You’re about to be presented to God Himself and judged either worthy to Ascend... or worthy to follow a mortal Calling instead. You know there’s hardly a chance that God will pick you - of the thousands and thousands of children to be Called in any given year, He typically only chooses one or two. Rarely, up to four, and sometimes even zero if there are no worthy children in the lot.

    No one has yet been picked in the two previous Calling days this year, and no one has yet been picked today - here or in any of the churches spread through the city. You know that you won’t be picked either, or at least you’ve tried to convince yourself that you won’t.

    ... But there’s still that tiny, tiny chance that <em>you</em> could be the one judged worthy. Your heart is racing.

He’s a kindly man in his late 30s, muscular from volunteering in construction during his free time. You know him well, as he helped your family a great deal during your sickness. He was only a deacon then, but was promoted to full priest shortly after you recovered. He’s had a soft spot for you and your brother ever since, passing you toys and treats and putting in good words with your teachers.

    Today, though, there are no extra words. Everything must be done with ritualistic precision, or God may deem you unworthy before you even enter the chamber. Priests like Father Turner hold a great deal of responsibility due to this, but you trust him to do his part just as he trusts you to do yours.

    He dips his fresh fern - plucked from the ground just this morning - in the small bowl of blessed water and anoints your forehead with it, tracing a small circle with the tip. Then, each bare shoulder in turn gets the same treatment. Left, then right. Soul, then Mind, then Body. Opposite of the usual order, but today is hardly a usual day. You shiver despite yourself.

    “Child of pure Body, Mind, and Soul,” he announces. “Go now with my blessing and learn your true Calling!”

    You steady your breathing as you walk measuredly past the priest and push open the plain wooden door to the Calling room. Behind you, Father Turner begins to speak again. “Seth Ivan Goodall.” Your brother. The ceremony moves quickly; most Callings take only moments and there are many children to get through. You close the door, take a deep breath, and walk to the tiled circle in the center.

There is a stained-glass window in the ceiling, currently letting in rosy orange light from the midmorning sun. There is a black-tiled circle set into the floor and a white cloth pad where you are to kneel. There is a simple wooden matan - an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle - fixed to the opposite wall. That’s it. You kneel on the pad, clasp your hands together, and look at the matan. The symbol of God. Divinity wrought from simple geometry.

    You find yourself tracing the triangle’s lines for a moment. Start at the bottom right and move left. Body, the basis for the other two aspects. Move up the left side to the apex. Mind, the channel through which Soul and Body meet. Finally, move down the right side from the apex, completing the triangle. Soul, your true self. Most days, Body and Mind are key. Today, it’s all about your Soul.

    You have no further instructions. Father Turner had just said to kneel in the circle and your Calling would come to you in a matter of moments. Not knowing what else to do, you close your eyes and pray.

    <em>... God, if you’re there, please send me a sign. Tell me my Calling.</em>

    “...”

    There is no divine vision; no supernal voice or sudden, shocking revelation. You feel a little warm, but the room is warm. Nothing. God, if He’s watching, remains silent.

    <em>Please!</em> You try again, suddenly terrified that something has gone wrong. <em>I need to know! Please, tell me...</em>

    Silence for many seconds, then a knock on the door. Your brother’s voice carries through the wood. “Uh, Jess? Are you... done?”

    You stand up, distraught and not sure how to answer. Did the Calling ceremony just... not work for you? What would that mean? That God Himself has no plans for you? Were... a horrible thought strikes you. Were you... not meant to survive your illness? You almost didn’t; was your miraculous recovery <em>against God’s will?</em>

Please leave the Calling chamber. We can discuss your results after the ceremony.”

    You almost shudder at his concern, but try to shake off your growing anxiety. Maybe this is just how it works if you weren’t judged worthy to Ascend. Maybe you’re the only one who would overthink it so badly and everyone else just left like normal. That wouldn’t be too bad, right?

    You take a deep breath, then walk over to the door.

    And open it.

    Brilliant white light washes over Seth and Father Turner, spilling out and illuminating the church proper. A gasp rises from many throats; your brother and the priest step back, shielding their eyes. From you. The light is coming <em>from you.</em>

    You hold up your arms in wonder, staring at the dazzling glow. Father Turner shouts to an acolyte, but the younger man is already moving, running to the heavy rope behind the pulpit that leads to the church’s roof. In moments, the enormous brass bell begins to toll, signaling that the most momentous of events has come to pass. It tolls for <em>you!</em>

    “Jessamine, congratulations; oh <em>congratulations!</em>” Father Turner is saying, tears in his eyes. “You have been chosen for the Lord’s greatest honor. You will Ascend to join the Cathedra as an Angel.”

    As the other nearby churches begin to ring their own bells, spreading news of your Ascension throughout the city; as Seth and your parents rush to you in astonishment; as the assembled congregation breaks out into shouted celebration and fragments of song; as the world goes to chaos around you, all you can do is stand rooted in place, bewildered by your own steadily-dimming glow.

    God answered your pleas. Your Calling is to be an Angel.

    <em>Scene 1</em>
    Your first duty as an Angel, Father Turner says once things start to calm down, is not to leave the church. You and your family - once Seth has gone through his Calling as well and come out <em>without</em> a blast of holy light - are sent to sit in one of the back offices to wait for someone as the priest finishes the ceremony. One of the church’s two deacons and the acolyte from earlier wait just outside the doorway, polite and pleasant... but very clear that you are not to go anywhere for the time being.

    It doesn’t take long at all for the “someone” to show up; you’ve hardly had a chance to say anything to your parents before an older man in the signature blue-striped coat of a bishop arrives, converses briefly with the deacon in a low voice, then enters the room. He has to shield his eyes from your glow as he comes in; it’s dimmed a little, but it’s still far too bright to be comfortable.

    “Good morning,” he says, making the sign of the matan and bowing to you. His voice is a little unsteady, as if he’s out of breath. “New Angel Jessamine Laura Goodall, correct?”

    You open your mouth, but your mom answers first. “That’s right.”

    “Good, good.” The bishop taps his satchel as he continues. “My name is Bishop Ashel Spencer; I’m here to get all the paperwork settled before your daughter’s official initiation. With Angels, we need to get started right away, so if you two wouldn’t mind following me to fill out some forms?”

    Your parents stand at the bishop’s gesture, though your dad puts a hand on your shoulder and doesn’t step forward. “Will Jessamine be coming along?”

We just need signatures from her legal guardians; the details she needs to know will be provided during her initiation.” Seeming to notice his concern, the bishop picks up his sentence awkwardly. “The forms should only take fifteen minutes or so; your daughter will be right here when you’re done. You will have time to speak with her afterwards, of course.”

    “It’s okay, dad,” you say quietly. Your voice sounds different, though you can’t quite pin down how.

    He raises his hand. “Alright, alright. We’ll be right back, okay?”

    “Okay.”

    Bishop Spencer leaves with your parents; you can hear them speaking in the hallway, already going over the legal ramifications of your Ascension. You don’t need to know about that, you suppose. Though it might be nice.

    With the room now quiet and the promise of fifteen minutes before their return, Seth nudges you with his shoulder, sporting an enormous grin. “Jess,” he whispers.

    “... What?” you whisper back, half-smiling yourself just because of how contagious that big dumb grin is.

    “What do you mean what? You’re an ANGEL, that’s what!”

    “... Yeah?”

    “I don’t even know where to start! This has to be the best thing that’s ever happened to you, or me, or mom and dad! You know that Angels don’t get sick ever, right? No more doctors for you!”

    “I - you’re right.” That hadn’t sunk in until now. You had technically recovered from your brutal childhood illness, but lingering symptoms had persisted for years afterwards. You had been a frail child even after leaving the hospital, getting sick more often and more seriously than anyone else your age. Seth had done his best to help, bringing you notes and assignments when you had to miss school - or just medicine and dumb jokes on the worst days - but the constant struggle had worn on you. As you got older, your health slowly improved, but even now, a moderately bad cold would knock you out for a week.

    After today, you would never have to deal with that again.

Your lungs don’t hurt at all. “Really good, even.”

    “See? And you’re really tough now, too! I bet you’re never gonna get hurt again.”

    “... Maybe.”

    You don’t actually know a lot about what Angels are or what they do. You’ve only seen a few in your life, mostly during district assemblies where they didn’t do anything besides look perfect. You’ve never heard of an Angel dying, but they do take on the toughest, most dangerous jobs that regular humans can’t handle.

    ... You keep saying “they,” like you aren’t one of them now. <em>You</em> will have to take on those jobs now. A few prickles of anxiety prod at your stomach, nerves breaking through even your new divine glow. Good to know you can still worry, you suppose.

    “Hey, Jess, what was God like?”

    “Huh?”

    “During your Calling. For me, I just went in, sat in the circle, and then I just kinda <em>knew</em> it wasn’t me.” Seth glances at you, though he can’t look for very long with your glow still so strong. “Of course, going <em>right after</em> you kinda made that obvious already, but... I just knew anyway. It felt really sure and almost, uh, calm, I guess? But yours must’ve been different, right? Did you talk to God?”

    “Er...” For some reason, even though you don’t know what an Angel’s Calling <em>should</em> be like, you feel a little embarrassed about yours. “I mean... I didn’t <em>talk</em> to God, really, but there was a... a sort of, um... like a feeling of a really bright light...” It’s almost relieving to still be unable to come up with a convincing lie in time, just like normal. Maybe that’s an Angel thing too; lying is bad and you’re supposed to be perfectly good, right?

    Seth doesn’t even have to say anything to disbelieve you; he just rolls his eyes.

I just went in, sat down, and nothing happened at all. That’s why it took so long; I was just sitting there thinking it didn’t work! Then, well, you know.”

    “N-nothing? Really?”

    “Keep your voice down!” you hiss, glancing at the door. The acolyte scratches his nose absently. “I don’t know if that’s normal or something weird, and I really don’t want anyone to...”

    “What are they going to do? You’re <em>literally glowing!</em> Of course it worked!”

    “I - I mean, yeah, but...” You can feel your face heating up; the glow brightens.

    Seth nudges you again, laughing. “Same ol’ Jess. Some people talk about how Angels are all different from the people they used to be and I was worried for a bit, but you’re still the same!”

    “Y-yeah.” You try to dampen the glow, but don’t know how. The room continues to be about three times brighter than it needs to be.

    “But seriously,” Seth says, nudging your shoulder for the third time. “I’m really happy for you. I think you’re gonna be a great Angel, and I’m gonna make sure I can help!”

    That big dumb grin is back and bigger than ever; you have to smile back. All you can say is “Thanks,” but that’s okay. He knows what you mean.

    <em>Scene 2</em>
    After a while, Bishop Spencer comes back with your parents. “I will return with Father Turner once his part in the Calling ceremony is complete, as it is tradition for the uplifting priest to accompany new Angels to their initiation.” Then, for the first time, he actually addresses you directly. “Angel, you will leave for the Cathedra once we return. Please say your farewells and prepare to depart before then.”

    He nods to you briefly, then turns and leaves.

    A few seconds pass. You have a question. “Wait, <em>now?</em> I thought - maybe tomorrow, or... How long am I going to be gone? Do I get to visit, at least?”

    The bishop has left, but your dad knows. “... Yes, now. You’re important now, Jessamine, dreadfully so. The Cathedra wants to start your training immediately.” A beat; you feel your mom stroke your hair just like she did years ago when you were little. “You’ll be able to visit for holidays, but I’m afraid that’s it.”

    Mom is crying. Dad is trying to hide it, but he is too. Just a little. You trade worried looks with Seth, the mood taking an abrupt turn. “I-it’s okay,” you say, trying to be reassuring while also remembering the next holiday. “Founding Day isn’t that far away.”

    “It’s not just that,” your mom says, recovering somewhat. “These are happy tears too, sweetie. You - an Angel - I just can’t believe it... Please, work hard and be happy... but stay safe.”

    “Jess isn’t gonna get hurt again!” Seth chimes in. “She’s sick-proof and really tough now; no more doctors or anything!”

    You try to look tough. Your parents chuckle a little, but dad elaborates. “Just be careful, kiddo. You are going to be really tough, but they’re going to give you tough jobs because of it. I know you’re more than capable; just please promise you won’t ever get overconfident, okay?”

    “Okay, dad. I’ll be careful; promise.”

    He lets out a breath. “Good. You’ll do great. I know you will.”

You ready to go?”

    “Ah, er-”

    “Couple minutes; just be ready, please. The bishop’s a punctual fellow.”

    You look back at your family. Mom’s curly brown hair and reddened eyes. Dad’s calloused hands and gentle smile. Seth’s boundless energy and positivity. It’s not like you’re going away forever. You’ve just been chosen for the highest honor possible at such a young age. Joy; optimism. Right?

    You’re wrapped in a hug and feel some of your anxiety recede. “It’ll be okay,” you whisper again, though you don’t know who exactly you’re trying to reassure.

    Not long after, the priest arrives. You say your last goodbyes... and leave the room. That’s it. You won’t be seeing your family again for months at least. Instead, you will be training to be an Angel.

    Father Turner leads you out the church’s rear doors to an ornate carriage pulled by pure white horses. Bishop Spencer is already there, along with a driver and a group of other clergymen you’ve never seen before. You’re directed to the cushioned rear seat with the windows down, the better to display you as you travel. You’re still glowing, though it’s less visible in the foggy daylight of the city proper.

    “Jessamine,” Father Turner says, sitting across from you and speaking softly as the carriage begins to move. “The people of the city will be watching as we make our way to the station. This ride is your first appearance as their future guardian and protector; people will cheer and try to speak to you. The acolytes below will keep them away from the carriage, so please just try to look pleasant but somewhat distant, if you can. Smile and wave occasionally, but don’t address anyone directly. You are not yet able to give Blessings, no matter what anyone on the streets may think. Okay?”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1158946884229005363 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1158946884229005363><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, October 3, 2023 10:01 PM">10:01 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Your anxiety is back. You can already hear the crowd; how did they know where you would be so fast? It’s only been... less than an hour, probably? “Um, pleasant but distant. Don’t say anything, smile sometimes? Right?”

    “That’s right. Just take it in. We’ll speak more on the train in a few minutes.”

    With that, the priest leans back, almost disappearing into the shadowy depths of the carriage. You can still see him perfectly fine - especially with your glow - but he’ll be a lot less visible to anyone outside. Instead, they’ll see you.

    The carriage rumbles onto a main street and the roar of the crowd engulfs you. It’s astonishing just how many people have managed to assemble in such a short time. The sidewalks are packed; people lean out of windows and throw flower petals down; the acolytes walking alongside your carriage have to actively push citizens out of the way so the horses won’t trample anyone. It’s so loud you wouldn’t be able to pick out any individual shouts to respond to even if you hadn’t been cautioned against doing exactly that.

    Experimentally, you smile nervously and give a little wave out the window. There’s an obvious roar as people cheer even harder for you. For you! You haven’t even done anything yet! Somehow, your gaze lights on a woman in a dirty green dress clinging to a lamp post with one hand and holding a crying baby with the other. She’s shouting with the rest of the crowd, seemingly oblivious to the baby’s screams and trying to get it to look at you.

    You look away, uneasy, and shuffle to the other window. Another little wave; another huge cheer. Someone near the front is scuffling with one of the acolytes, screaming so loud you can actually make out some of his words even through the overall roar. “PLEASE!” he’s yelling. “-BLESSING - WIFE! JUST - TIME-” Another acolyte makes his way over and shoves the man back. He vanishes into the crowd.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1158946961660067870 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1158946961660067870><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, October 3, 2023 10:01 PM">10:01 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>It’s not just concerning sights, though; you just happened to notice those two since they stood out. You spot a group of schoolkids singing something to you, protected from the greater crowd by a constable or two in their distinctive rounded hats. An older couple standing contentedly in a rowhouse’s doorway; the gentleman throws a handful of flower petals as you pass. A few lesser clergymen in white robes, presumably from other nearby churches. Then, an even less common sight: a group of four weathered men in drab brown fatigues and armored helmets. They raise their fists as you pass, raising a collective shout before bowing in respect. Soldiers from the wastes. You know Angels often accompany men like that outside the city, but no more. The land beyond the walls remains a mystery to you.

    The crowd lessens as you get further from the church, and is almost manageable by the time you arrive at the nearest train station. The acolytes surround you and the two ministers, escorting you from the carriage up the steps to the elevated tracks where a gleaming brass locomotive is waiting. The station platform is empty aside from a few constables keeping the crowd back, the closest of which make the matan sign and step back deferentially.

    You’re led to the train’s first car, all ornately decorated with rich wood and brass accents. Both ministers join you, but the regular clergy take the second - much more ordinary - car instead. In mere moments, the doors shut and the brakes release. You’re on your way.

    The train isn’t exactly quiet - the track clatters beneath you and the locomotive itself puffs just ahead - but in comparison to the crowd, it feels like dead silence. The bishop sits down near the rear of the car; you and Father Turner take seats near the middle.

    “Ah, what an experience, eh?” he asks. “How are you feeling?”

    <em>Scene 3</em>
    “A little overwhelmed,” you admit. “It’s only been... an hour?”

    He chuckles gently. “I understand. It’s my first time helping anyone to Ascend as well, though my part is much less stressful than yours.” A pause; he glances at something out the window as the train continues to accelerate. “Take some time to relax here. Nothing is expected of you until we arrive in twenty or so minutes.”

    You try to take his advice, settling back into the deep, plush seat. The car rattles as you pick up speed, but somehow the vibrations aren’t transferred to the chair. At least, not enough to be uncomfortable. It’s a very pleasant ride, really, and you can see out over the city in a way you’ve rarely been able to.

    The fog is omnipresent, of course, blanketing every building and limiting your view to only a few blocks. You’ve heard that there used to be less of it, and that there are some places in the wastelands that don’t have any at all, but to you, it’s just a fact of life. Air just looks like that.

    But what you can see still looks different from above. Smoke-stained chimneys, discolored rainwater tracks on roofs and taller walls, and the bulky steel rail infrastructure supporting your heavy train. You’re heading towards the center of the city - the Cathedra itself - so new construction grows more common as you travel. As the population grows amidst limited space, architects are building up rather than out, letting older buildings rot abandoned while converting stable foundations into tall apartment blocks reaching nearly a dozen stories high. A dozen! So tall the skeletal steel frames tower over even the elevated tracks you’re riding on right now.

Mechanical engines, wheels, and cranes hint at the answer, but you’re whipping by so quickly now it’s impossible to catch more than a glimpse of anything. You spare a moment to wonder how deafeningly loud your passage must sound to those on the ground below.

    ... Some time later, you realize you’ve gotten distracted just watching the city pass. A portion of your nervousness returns, though thankfully not as much as before. At least you won’t be out in a crowd again after this. Er, right? Will you?

    “Um,” you begin, getting Father Turner’s attention. “What happens after we get there?”

    “Ah, eager to arrive?”

    “... A little nervous...”

    “Oh, Jessamine, don’t worry. Here’s what the rest of your day will hold.”

    Father Turner is briefly interrupted as the car jostles and heavy support beams whip past on both sides. You turn back to the window momentarily to watch a stretch of dull water pass beneath the train; you’re crossing the Endle River, the deep waterway that cuts through the city. You’ve seen it before, of course, but rarely at such speed.

    “S-sorry,” you say once the bridge crossing is complete and you’re back above solid ground. “I’m listening.”

    The priest smiles, but doesn’t comment on your distraction. “When we arrive, you will be escorted to the Lordstone Cathedral, where you will meet with the Emissary.”

    “W-<em>what?!</em> Right away?”

    The Emissary is the leader of the Cathedra and arguably the most important man in the city - or the world. He is the only person alive who can speak to God even indirectly, surpassing even Angels. You’ve heard he wields incredible powers and has the ability to vaporize people on the spot for any infraction. And, worse...

As you know, the Emissary must decide whether to confirm your Ascension before anything else can happen. Don’t worry, though; the last time any new Angel was rejected has to have been nearly a thousand years ago.”

    Bishop Spencer interjects from the other end of the car. “False Angel Erejil. Just about nine centuries ago now. Bishops have to learn the signs the Emissary at the time used to detect Erejil’s corruption and look out for them in any new Angels we bring in. I wouldn’t be here if you had shown such darkness; an Archangel would have been sent in my stead to bring you in for execution. So don’t worry about being rejected; it’s all but a formality these days.”

    “...” You don’t feel very reassured.

    “It’s interesting, isn’t it?” Father Turner muses. “God chooses Angels, but the Emissary - a mortal man - has the power to confirm them. It truly shows the love He holds for us, by placing so much trust in our hands. If you get the chance later, you should read one of the histories on the turmoil surrounding Erejil’s execution; some scholars consider it to be...”

    You stare at him.

    “Sorry, Jessamine. Us stuffy old ministers can get a little carried away with religious theory. Isn’t that right, Bishop?”

    “You’re 37. Stuffy <em>young</em> ministers aren’t immune either.”

    Father Turner laughs. “The point is, Jessamine, you’ll be fine. The Emissary isn’t nearly as scary as his reputation.”

    “... Okay.”

    “Ah, let’s just move on, shall we? After your confirmation, you will be taken on a brief tour of the Cathedra campus, be measured for your uniforms, and will meet some of your future tutors. After that, you will be shown your room and given some free time to adjust. Then, starting tomorrow and continuing for the next six years, you will train to become the best Angel and servant of the Lord you can be.”

    “What kind of training?”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1159654007292297246 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1159654007292297246><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, October 5, 2023 8:51 PM">8:51 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Well, all kinds. You’ll continue your normal education, but additionally strengthen your Body, Mind, and Soul.” The priest touches his shoulders and forehead in the correct order as he says that; you find yourself almost unconsciously mirroring his actions. “Physical strength and endurance, mental acuity and resilience, and your divine connection to God. As well as learning of the...” He glances as Bishop Spencer, choosing his words carefully. “The darkness that you will fight. You’ll even be able to choose a few classes of your own; whatever suits you! I’m certain you will find your training very fulfilling.”

    You sit there for a moment, willing yourself to ask about the “darkness you will fight,” but you’re too late. The train starts to slow and both ministers look up. You follow their eyes to a huge, dark mass slowly appearing from the fog and splitting into individual shapes. Tall, elegant spires. Brutal, blocky towers. Greenery weaving between the two. It shouldn’t seem cohesive, yet it somehow does. The Grand Cathedra.

    “Here’s our stop,” Father Turner notes, getting to his feet. “The Cathedra station is just outside the campus gates and is connected to every other station in the city by a direct line. Angels often use the trains here to get around quickly. At least, before they get their wings.”

    Indeed, your train has hardly slowed to a stop before another locomotive pulls out, quickly accelerating on a parallel track to the one you had just left. Only one car. Presumably an Angel on their way to some important task. That could be you one day. Will be. You disembark, noticing another locomotive idling at the platform and a handful of regular constables speaking quietly nearby. One of them glances over at you, but looks away again after realizing you’re going the other direction. Not the Angel they’re waiting for.

You and the two ministers go first, nodded through by a pair of armored guards, but the rest of your group of clergy have to produce regular identification documents. Presumably another benefit to your still-dimming glow. Maybe by tomorrow morning it’ll be gone entirely. Discreetly, you try again, but you still can’t control it; you don’t even know how you would.

    “The Lordstone Cathedral is just ahead and to the right,” Father Turner tells you, walking slightly behind the bishop. “You can have a few minutes to prepare to meet the Emissary, if you want, or we can go in right away. I wouldn’t worry about him either way; he’s a perfectly reasonable man.”

    <em>Scene 4</em>
    “Er... I’ll, um...” You can’t decide if it’s better to have extra time to prepare (but extra time to worry), or if it’s better to just get it over with. “...”

    “Let’s take a few minutes, shall we?” Father Turner suggests after several seconds of silence. You nod in agreement, not entirely sure why you’re so nervous. Everyone’s telling you it’ll be fine, right?

    Bishop Spencer enters the cathedral to inform the clergy there, so you and Father Turner sit down on an ancient stone bench in a secluded little garden just to the side. Thick, woody vines or roots climb its legs, carving smooth channels in the stone. Someone has trimmed away anything that would cross the top, though, keeping it clear.

    “Water?” the priest offers, producing a cup from somewhere you didn’t see. “Acolytes at the cathedral gave it to me.”

    You hadn’t noticed, but your throat is dry. You accept the cup, feeling your glow strengthen just a little as you drink. Wait... feel? What did it feel like? You close your eyes and try to focus, but can’t get a grip on the glow anymore; you’re not sure. A fat, fuzzy bee drifts sedately from flower to flower on the other side of the garden and you let your attention be pulled away by it instead.

    “There are a lot of gardens here,” you say thoughtfully, watching the bee. “Why? The rest of the city doesn’t have this many.”

    “In brief, because plants are expensive to maintain,” he answers. “The Cathedra can afford to hire a large number of groundskeepers, but extending efforts like that to the rest of the city would be very difficult. Most of the city’s budget for greenery goes to the outer farms, since they provide food at scale. Smaller parks like this just can’t do that.”

    “But those look like fruits over there,” you say, pointing. “Isn’t that food?”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1160277177670053968 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1160277177670053968><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, October 7, 2023 2:07 PM">2:07 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Well, yes. All plants in the city have to be capable of growing at least something edible, as you know, and the Cathedra’s gardens do help feed the Angels and clergy who reside here. What I meant before was about <em>scale</em> - the outer farms can be much more efficient since they’re so large. Gardens like this have to be tended by hand, but the farms can use machinery to harvest more food more often.”

    “I see...” You’ve never been to the outer farms, actually, so you’re not sure what they look like. Maybe you’ll have a reason to go with your new duties.

    You stay in the garden a little longer, watching the bees work and thinking about plants and food in general. Your worries about the Emissary seem more distant... right up until Bishop Spencer returns and asks if you’re ready yet. You don’t think so, but doubt it’s going to get any better if you keep putting it off. Besides, you don’t want to make the most powerful man in the Cathedra wait. He might vaporize you for the annoyance.

    <em>... Why do I keep thinking about that?</em> You can’t get the image of yourself exploding into a cloud of dust out of your mind. The imaginary Emissary shakes his distinguished head and calls for an acolyte with a broom. You shake your own head in turn, trying to pay attention to reality as the ministers lead you through the entryway and into the Lordstone Cathedral proper.

    The first thing you notice is the Lordstone itself, a twenty-foot tall obelisk of deep blue crystal looming over the chancel. Its facets are dotted with thousands of lighter specks that almost seem to twinkle and shift, together forming an image that resembles the starfields and galaxies said to be visible above the permanent fog. You can’t tell how close the resemblance is, but soldiers and Angels who have been to the wastes - where the fog is thinner - claim it’s a perfect replica.

The specifics are somewhat vague beyond that, but you more or less understand that the Emissary can use the Lordstone to channel God’s will into physical effects. Such as confirming new Angels, or the vaporization that you keep worrying about. You’re not sure what else he can do; the Emissary is rarely seen beyond the scope of his edicts.

    Speaking of, the Emissary himself is not what you expected. A very old man sits in a simple throne of dark wood and silver accents just before the Lordstone. He wears white robes with long sleeves, a sleek black necklace bearing the matan symbol, and a silver circlet on his thinning white hair. You knew he was mortal - no Angel can become the Emissary - but... he just looks like a grandpa. Your stomach starts to untwist; a man like this couldn’t possibly vaporize you, right?

    You kneel before the pulpit, bowing your head in deference. Father Turner and Bishop Spencer do the same on either side; the Emissary far outranks all of you.

    “Jessamine Goodall,” the Emissary calls in a thin, wavering voice. “Raise your head.”

    You do. He’s looking directly at you. His irises are pure gold and his gaze seems sharper than any blade; it’s all you can do to not flinch as he searches for any mote of corruption hiding in your Soul.

    Finally, he breaks eye contact and stands, using the chair’s arms for support. “Jessamine Goodall,” he repeats, still avoiding calling you an Angel. “You have been Blessed for Ascension by Father Carlos Turner, accepted for duty by Bishop Ashel Spencer, and chosen by the Lord God Himself. Tell me, are you pure of Body, Mind, and Soul?”

    You find your voice stronger than expected. “I am.”

    “Do you swear your immortal, divine loyalty to the Cathedra and God above?”

    “I do.”

    “And do you promise to protect the citizens of this city and this world, though it may cost you your life?”

The possibility that you may someday have to sacrifice your life seems unreal; far away. “... I do.”

    He makes the sign of the matan and slowly descends the steps towards you. “I witness and honor these oaths, sworn before our most holy relic. Rise, Angel Jessamine Goodall, and take your place among God’s most honored servants.”

    You stand. The Emissary touches you on the right shoulder, then the left, then the forehead. Body, Mind, Soul. He smiles kindly, but says nothing more, instead simply climbing back up the stairs to his wooden throne. The two ministers stand as well and you are escorted out of the Lordstone Cathedral as quickly as you entered.

    “Congratulations, Jessamine,” Bishop Spencer says as you emerge back into foggy daylight. “You are a true Angel now.”

    “See, I told you there was nothing to be worried about!” Father Turner chimes in. “Your ceremony went as by-the-book as it could.”

    You smile weakly, still feeling drained from... being looked at? Whatever the Emissary did to you, it was definitely a real, physical thing. No mere anxiety could tire you out this much. “Thanks for... everything, really.”

    Father Turner chuckles, seeming much more energetic than just before the ceremony. “You are so very welcome. Oh, I’m just so pleased; an Angel from my own church after only four years, and it was Jessamine Goodall, of all people. You certainly deserve it; I hope you find your time fulfilling and that you serve God well.”

    “Thank you,” you say again. “I’ll do my best.”

    “Ah, here’s your next escort,” Bishop Spencer says, noticing an approaching woman in a dark grey robe trimmed with silver. You don’t know what the outfit means; it’s outside of the normal minister hierarchy. “With that, I will take my leave. Serve well, Angel. We will speak again.”

    “Sister.” He returns the sign. “Jessamine, this is Sister - apologies, I don’t believe we’ve met before?”

    “Veriline Noll, Father. I don’t believe we have.”

    “Glad my memory isn’t failing me. Sister Noll, then. She will help you get settled in and prepared for the start of your training tomorrow, as well as a number of other things she is much more qualified to explain than I am.”

    “Are you leaving too?”

    “I must get back to my church, unfortunately. We ordinary priests don’t visit the Grand Cathedra for long.”

    “Ah.” It makes sense, of course. Father Turner has other duties to attend to; he can’t be shepherding you around all day. But still, with him gone, that will leave you all alone in this vast, confusing place, without a single person you know. “Well, er, goodbye, then.”

    Another kindly smile. He crouches a little to be more on your eye level. “Good luck, Angel. Though I’m sure you’ll hardly need it.”

    You don’t know what to say, so you just go with “... Thanks.”

    And off he goes. You’re left alone with Sister Noll on the worn path just outside of the Lordstone Cathedral. Your new life begins tomorrow, and you only have the rest of the day to prepare for it. That being the case, you feel...

    <em>Scene 5</em>
    ... curious, mostly. The bulk of your anxiety seems to have passed with the initiation ceremony, and after a few minutes of walking, the strange exhaustion from before mostly fades as well. So now it’s time to take in as much information as you can so you don’t make a fool of yourself tomorrow.

    Your first stop is the two-story wooden general services building tucked away behind a copse of evergreens near the middle of the Cathedra campus. This is apparently where the mundane tasks required to support the campus are completed, such as food preparation, laundry, and - relevant to you right now - measuring for your new uniforms. This goes relatively quickly and you’re out the door again before too long - someone will deliver your outfits before you need them in the morning. You hardly spoke to the workers inside; you were just too nervous about their obvious deference to say anything.

    “Er, Mi - Sister Noll, is everyone like that around Angels? Even here?”

    She glances back at the building, hidden behind its barrier of trees. “No, not everyone. Even among the support staff, you’ll find people willing to speak up and treat you like a human rather than a divine being - if that’s what you want, of course. Many Angels prefer it the other way, which is why it’s usually safer for the staff to assume excessive respect until they know what your specific preferences are.”

    “... Safer?”

    “As an Angel, your word now carries immense weight. If you were displeased, you could request any of the staff you just met to be dismissed simply by speaking to a brother or sister such as myself. With even a trivial grievance, your request would likely be granted.”

    “But... no one would do that, right? You don’t get to be an Angel unless you’re...” You trail off as Sister Noll shakes her head slowly.

No one really knows the true criteria that allow a child to Ascend, but Angels are just as likely to be petty bullies as kind-hearted softies.” A glance to you; she seems to guess which side of the divide you might fall on. “Of course, we do our best to get you all into shape by the time you turn 18, but it takes time and no training is perfect.”

    “...”

    “Listen, I’m not saying that most - or even many - Angels are jerks. Just... new trainee Angels are twelve year old kids who suddenly get blessed with power and importance beyond any of their peers. The Ascension process doesn’t change your Mind or personality - at least not immediately - so they’re still just children. And kids aren’t well known for using power responsibly. No offense, of course, Miss Angel.”

    “... That’s okay...”

    “Soft spoken, aren’t you? You might get along with Serri; I’ll see if I can track her down for tomorrow. Anyway, just remember one of the core tenets that’s going to get drilled into your head over and over for six years. You may be an Angel, but you’re still only human despite your blessings. You’re fallible. Everyone is, whether they’ve got a divine Soul or not. Even God makes mistakes, and <em>we</em> are far less than God. Got it?”

    You nod, but have a question. “God... makes mistakes?”

    “Ah, do they not talk about that part in normal mass? Where the corruption came from?”

    “From another world, right? On a falling star that... uh... no, huh?”

    Sister Noll seems amused. “Flaws in our Souls. God made us wrong on His first try. He fixed us later, of course, but it was too late to stop the corruption without destroying the world and starting over. But as you might guess, He loves us too much to do that.”

But - wait, how does that work? How did He make us? The church never goes into any detail about the original creation - do we really know more about what happened? How? Did-”

    “Sorry, I’m not the right person to answer all those questions. If you’re really into history, though, you’ll love your classes with Brother Trigg. I swear, that man could tell you five interesting things that happened in any year from Genesis to now without even consulting a book. Interested?”

    You duck down, faintly embarrassed at your obvious enthusiasm. “Maybe a little.” Then, feeling a need to explain, you continue. “I had a... lot of time to read when I was little. I got really sick for two years and couldn’t go out, so I was given a lot of books.”

    “Ah, sorry to hear that. I’m sure you’re feeling much better now, right?”

    “It’s...” You can’t really sum up just how good it feels to not have that constant ache in your lungs; that constant shortness of breath that reminds you the sickness could come back at any moment. Force you back into bed for the day or the week. All it needed was a chance; another illness to open the door.

    All gone, now. “It’s wonderful.”

    “First stop on the tour,” she tells you a few minutes later. “This is Oth Hall, named after Archangel Din Oth. He was a master of the Mind and one of the first pioneers to explore how to combine internal and external mental manipulations. If you ever decide to learn telepathy, you’ll have him to thank. Anyway, this hall is where you’ll fortify your Mind and practice mental miracles. Potentially under my training, if you so desire.”

    Oth Hall is one of the blockier, more modern buildings, all brick and metal and glass. Decorative ivy climbs the walls in a way that seems like it’d be hard to maintain. You’re distracted from your original questions about the building’s namesake by Sister Noll’s last sentence. “You’re a tutor?”

    “I did say <em>we</em> try to get you into shape by age 18, didn’t I?”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161112915659731004 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161112915659731004><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, October 9, 2023 9:28 PM">9:28 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“I thought you meant everyone here, not just...”

    “Well, you caught me. I teach trainee Angels how to strengthen their Minds... and also how to swing a sword without hurting themselves. And <em>with</em> hurting whoever they’re trying to hit, ideally.”

    “Those... go together?”

    “Body, Mind, Soul,” she says, forming the triangle. “Everything goes together; it’s just a matter of finding the connections. If you take my advanced course, it’ll make sense why I combine them. But of course, you’ll be spending the next year learning the basics, so don’t worry about it too much now. You’ll get there.”

    Sister Noll next introduces you to Forger Hall, named after Archangel Phineas Forger, who mastered the Body in a similar way as Din Oth had mastered the Mind. It has an older, more traditional design, with pointy spires and wide training grounds around the outside. This is where you catch your first glimpse of other Angels on the grounds - or at least the first ones that have been obviously more than human. You slow to a stop on the path just outside, staring as a pair of radiantly beautiful young adults spar with shimmering, crystalline blades.

    “What’s caught your - ah, those two. Yes, it’s always a spectacle to see Angels fight, even for training like this. Enjoy it while you can; the groundskeepers are planning on replanting the trees around that area before winter this year. Some Angels don’t like being observed.”

    You quickly turn away, blushing. “Sorry, sorry-”

    “Oh, not these two. That’s Zeke on the right and... Stella on the left? Yeah; that’s her fighting style. They’re both fairly pleasant to talk to, though Zeke can be a little intense and Stella can be a little uptight.”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161112922899095693 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161112922899095693><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, October 9, 2023 9:28 PM">9:28 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>You look back towards the sandy field, taking in the unbelievably quick jolts of frenetic energy, followed by graceful dodges and sweeping blows. Melodious chimes echo with each clash of the swords, sounding more like bells than the much less pleasant sound of steel on steel that regular blades make. You’ve never seen a fight like this - though you’ve never really seen a fight at all. Unless Seth standing up for you in the school yard counts.

    “Hey, you want to go meet them once they’re done? Typically you meet your fellow trainees first, but I don’t see why not; they won’t hassle you.”

    You almost panic at the thought of approaching these two perfect, holy people... but, well, you’re one of them too. Sort of. Maybe... no; you’d just bother them. Plus, what would you even say? But...

    <em>Scene 6</em>
    “N-no, that’s okay. I don’t want to bother them.”

    “Oh, no, it wouldn’t be - ah, right. No problem; let’s just carry on.” She starts to lead you towards another nearby building, this one seemingly a converted cathedral with several modern additions and extra towers bolted onto it. “This is Illim Hall; can you guess what it’s named after?”

    “A master of the Soul?”

    “Got it in one. Archangel Ananiah Illim, inventor of the modern Blessing. She experimented with Soul manipulation to such a degree that some in the Cathedra dubbed her a heretic and called for her expulsion or execution, but the Emissary at the time didn’t agree. History seems to have taken her side, given the giant building named after her.”

    “Soul manipulation...” you whisper. You almost agree with the detractors; it seems almost heretical to think about. The Soul is your divine, immutable, true self. To... manipulate it just feels... unholy.

    “Don’t worry; you’ll learn more about it. Souls are an aspect of the self, just as Body and Mind. It’s not an inherently bad thing to change them or channel energy into someone else’s Soul - that’s how Blessings work and how Angels can cleanse corruption.” Her expression hardens a little, glancing up to a sculpture above the main entrance that depicts an Angelic woman with long, flowing hair. “Just know that there <em>are</em> some boundaries that must not be crossed when touching others’ Souls. You will learn where to stop. And if you don’t...”

    There’s a very long pause. You almost say something, but something about her tone stops you.

    “There are very few crimes that always result in execution. Purposeful damage or destruction of human Souls is one of them. But don’t worry; you won’t be at any risk as long as you follow the guidelines for how to handle your powers safely. And just remember what you’re touching when you Bless someone: the Soul is a person’s innermost self. Be respectful.”

    “...”

Looking at that building just gets me riled up. Not your fault; you’ll be fine.”

    You half-raise a hand, about to ask the obvious question, but Sister Noll turns aside before you can say anything. “Apologies, but I don’t wish to discuss it. Let’s move on.”

    You move on.

    There are a few other notable buildings on the Cathedra grounds, but you spend less time on them than the main three Halls and don’t speak to anyone there. A number of smaller cathedrals, churches, and lesser shrines are dotted around to pray to different aspects of God. Auxiliary buildings handle various tasks like maintenance of equipment, mundane office space, and housing for non-Angelic staff. Then, there’s the wide brownstone building that Sister Noll calls the Center. Counterintuitively, it’s nowhere near the center of the campus; instead, it’s situated near the edge, close to the train station. You had passed it on the way in and just hadn’t noticed.

    “This is where all the issue reports in the city come in, get sorted, and are assigned an Angel, if one is needed,” she explains. “Constabulary precinct offices have pneumatic connections to this building and can send in requests for assistance for anything beyond their normal capabilities. That, combined with the trains and occasional Angelic patrols in the field near known locations of interest, helps ensure that you all can make it to anywhere you’re needed in time.”

    You try to imagine how many tubes must run beneath the city streets, but can’t quite grasp it. A lot. “So do Angels have to stay here so they’re ready to go when anything comes in?”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161844752929521814 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161844752929521814><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 9:56 PM">9:56 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Not quite. There’s a rotation, so you’ll be on call for a certain amount of time on certain days. Some Angels do stay around the Center for most of their time on call, and most stop by when their turn in the rotation is coming up soon, but there’s no hard requirement to be there. The only requirement is that you’re on the Cathedra grounds while you’re on call, so you can hear the bells when your turn comes up.”

    “<em>That’s</em> what those are?” You had heard a few seemingly nonsensical chimes over the course of the day, but had written them off as unusual church bells. Apparently not.

    “That’s right: Center staff calling in Angels for their assignments. You don’t hear a lot of them since most Angels are pretty good about getting to the Center before their turn comes up, but sometimes they run late or are distracted or busy or whatever. With the bells, we’re covered anywhere on campus. You’ll be expected to memorize your unique chime sequence, then drop everything and run to the Center immediately if you hear it. Though not until your training is complete, of course.”

    “... What if I’m asleep?” The bells were loud, but not <em>that</em> loud.

    Sister Noll raises an eyebrow. “Don’t sleep when you’re on call.”

    “G-got it.”

    After a simple dinner of bread, water, and steamed vegetables, your last stop on the tour is also your last for the day. The sun - itself invisible behind the fog - is dipping below the horizon, and as such the night is creeping close. Flickering lights - some true flames and some mechanical - begin to appear in the shadows.

    Hearth Hall is another of the blocky, modern buildings - it somewhat resembles the tall apartment blocks you saw on the train ride in, though wider and decorated with the silver and dark wood accents that seem typical of the Cathedra. It’s - you count briefly - <em>eight floors tall</em>, putting it among the tallest buildings you’ve ever visited. As long as you don’t count the spires of churches and such, but you can’t actually stand on those.

There are several other Angelic residences around the campus, so all together I’d say maybe three quarters of Angels have a permanent residence here. Of course, that doesn’t mean they stay all the time - and some Angels do live in the city proper. Those are typically the ones stationed near the walls who fight in the wastes.”

    You try to count the windows. “How many are... here?”

    “There are about sixty apartments in Hearth Hall, and I believe most of them are currently occupied. So, about that many.”

    Sixty Angels, all in the same place. For some reason, it seems strange to you. What if something goes wrong? Even one Angel is so important that whole systems are built around Calling Days and ensuring every single child has their chance to Ascend. Sixty... the number makes sense for things like students or workers, but Angels? You’re used to thinking about one or two; not so many at once.

    You stare up at the building, unable to really explain your own thoughts even to yourself, let alone Sister Noll. You’re getting worked up over nothing again.

    She has a key for you. “Room 302. Third floor, obviously; it should be on the left side. Think you can handle having the rest of the night all to yourself?”

    You take the key, caught somewhat off guard. “Y-yes.” A pause. “Um, is there anything else I should do tonight?”

    “Nope; just get comfortable. You can stay in your room, wander around campus, or whatever you want. Just don’t leave the Grand Cathedra, alright? Tomorrow morning, you should report to Oth Hall at 8am sharp for your first day of training and to meet the other trainees. Any questions?”

    “No?”

    “Excellent. Well, Miss Angel, you have a good night. I won’t see you in the morning, but I will see you again soon. Farewell!”

    She leaves.

    There’s a minimal sort of lobby area with some lights and a desk, then a much more inviting common area just behind. No one’s there at the moment, so you head to the rear where there’s a door to the stairs. It pushes open without resistance, so you step into-

    “You’re new around here, aren’t you?”

    You spin around with a legitimate “eep!” of surprise, scanning the room for whoever could have spoken. After a moment, a pile of blankets catches your eye as somewhat out of place. “Um?” you gesture in a questioning manner.

    “Ah, sorry, just a moment.” The pile shuffles and a young man’s head emerges. Maybe late teens, medium length brown hair, and as radiantly handsome as the two Angels you had seen sparring earlier. A pair of hands follow, then the book they had been holding, and finally a glimmering orb of yellow luminance that fades into nothingness as it rises into the room. Magic? <em>Magic!</em> “Very rude of me; my apologies. I’m told I often fade into the furniture around here.”

    You step away from the stairway door, still too bewildered to say anything.

    “Goodness; I just keep making blunders, don’t I?” The Angel stands up, letting the blankets fall to reveal perfectly normal clothes beneath. Simple white cotton; they could be pajamas. Possibly are; given the time of night. Still, something about the way he wears them makes the outfit fashionable. “I’m Yara Conner. Fifth year trainee Angel, aspiring Soul channeller, and, of course, earnest servant of God. I presume you must be the newly Ascended Angel everyone was so excited about?”

    “...” You’re starting to calm down. He’s not so intimidating.

    <em>Scene 7</em>
    “Er - y-yes, I am!”

    Yara’s eyes widen. “Really? You’re one of the existing - I can’t believe - I’m so sorry; what’s your name again?”

    “No - no, I - my name’s Jessamine Goodall, but I - no, I meant ‘yes, I’m new’ - not...” You kind of trail off, covering your face and feeling a strong blush rise.

    “<em>Oh!</em> Goodness, my apologies again. I suppose this is what I get for spending so much time in books; I forget how to listen properly.”

    “Sorry...” you mutter.

    “No, no; not your fault! These things happen!”

    “...”

    He stands there for a few moments; you slowly recover and look up again.

    “So, Jessamine was it? Pleased to meet you.” He starts picking up some of the blankets on the floor, returning them to the chair. You’re not sure what to do with yourself, so you gather a few as well just to not be standing there awkwardly. “Ah, thanks. This is your first day, right?”

    “... Yeah.”

    “How’d you like the Emissary? Spookiest grandfather you’ll ever see?”

    “...”

    “No comment? I suppose you’ve been through quite a lot today as it is; perhaps I should shut my mouth and let you continue up to your room.”

    “N-no, it’s okay...” You quite would like to go upstairs at this point, but you don’t want to be rude by suggesting he was bothering you. It seems he’s trying to be friendly, at least.

    “Ah, I know that tone. No worries; I’ll be on my way shortly. It’s about time to return to work anyway.” Yara lowers his voice a little, as if he’s sharing some secret with you. “I’ve been putting off an essay for Brother Trigg by sitting around down here.”

    You blink, suddenly curious again. “An essay? Like... homework?”

    “Seems unbelievable, doesn’t it? Future divine guardians of Nucarreo, stuck writing papers about political turmoil in the fifth century? Ah well, it was my choice to take his course anyway; it’s worth the politics to learn about the corruption.”

    “The corruption,” you repeat, cautiously enthusiastic. “We get to learn what it is?”

Your first year is all the general background you need to know, and the differences from what’s taught in church or regular school. But if you’re really interested, you can take optional courses later on - or even after your six years, if you have the time. I’m studying how the corruption infects a Soul so I can better learn how to cure it - Brother Trigg’s course promised plenty of information.”

    “So what... <em>is</em> it?” you dare to ask. You’ve heard the term before, but regular sermons never went into any detail on it - and Sister Noll told you it hadn’t come down on a falling star anyway. “Flaws in our Souls,” she had said. What did that <em>mean?</em>

    “It’s why we exist: to fight against it.” Yara looks upwards, thinking. “Where do I even start? You’re going to learn this soon anyway, but...” He looks back down, smiling briefly at you. “Well, you want to know <em>now.</em> I know the feeling.”

    “I-if it’s not too much trouble...”

    “Ha! Just means I can procrastinate longer! Alright; corruption. It’s like... a disease, I suppose. You’re familiar with sickness of the Body, of course-” He doesn’t seem to notice your brief change of expression at that. “-and sickness of the Mind exists as well, though it’s less common. Corruption is sickness of the Soul.”

    “What... does that mean?”

    “It means that if you get infected by the corruption, your Soul grows dark and evil; your true self becomes warped and your Body and Mind follow suit. If it gets bad enough, you become a monster. One we - Angels - have to fight.”

    “A monster?”

    You’re trying very hard to not bother him by asking any more questions. So far, you’re succeeding.

    “Anyway, just like how regular sickness can be spread by carriers (like rats or such) the corruption has infected the planet. I’m not going to go into the history of it - Brother Trigg will happily talk your ear off if you let him - but suffice to say that’s why we can’t get rid of it, no matter how many people we cleanse. We’d have to purify the whole planet at once, and that’s such an enormous task that God Himself would need to destroy everything to do it.”

    “... Then it’s hopeless?”

    “Oh, no; not at all! There are all sorts of approaches to curing the corruption that haven’t been exhausted yet; there’s the spawning pools, the shade question, and Soul splicing (though that last one is, ahem, definitely unpopular) to list a few. Nothing’s impossible, and with God’s guidance, we’ll be able to figure it out; I’m sure of it.”

    You’re trying very hard, but you can’t hold back one more question. “But, you just said God would need to-”

    “<em>As things stand.</em> God is helping us as much as He can, but <em>we</em> - Angels - <em>are</em> the biggest way He’s helping. In time, things will change. We’ll solve it. If things were hopeless, God would have destroyed the world already, right?”

    “I... suppose.”

Please make sure you pay attention to Brother Trigg’s actually good explanation when the time comes.”

    “O-okay.”

    “I’ll see you tomorrow with everyone else!”

    He’s gone.

    You’re not sure what to make of all that, so you quickly rush into the stairwell and head to the third floor before anyone else can show up and start a conversation. It’s fully dark outside now and fog presses up against the windows with hazy tendrils, seeking the building’s light and warmth. Thankfully, no one else appears before you make it to room 302 and let yourself in.

    Close the door.

    Fall down against it, exhausted. Not physically, just socially. Even at school, you don’t think you’ve ever talked so much to anyone outside of your family in a single day.

    It’s late, but not <em>that</em> late; you’ve still got time in the evening. Still, you’ve got to be up and ready to go early tomorrow morning. With that in mind, you...

    <em>Scene 8</em>
    Take just a few moments to lean against the door, then push yourself upright again and go investigate your new room.

    It’s big. Your house - you suppose you should call it your parents’ house now - is larger, but only because it has a second floor. Here, all this space is just for you.

    There’s a narrow hallway from the main entrance to an open area near the exterior windows. Some dark wood cubbies and hooks along the passage’s right wall seem to be for coats or shoes or the like, and some decorations hung on the left wall depict the matan as well as some other, more abstract designs. You peer up at one of the most complicated ones - it seems to contain the matan near the center, but the geometry around the edges escapes your description. You’re not sure what it is, or what it might mean.

    Because you might as well make use of the cubbies, you store your shoes and light coat (Sister Noll gave it to you, as it was a breezy day and your tunic doesn’t even have sleeves) before continuing down the hall to reach the main room. There’s a sofa along the left wall - you had seen it from the entrance - as well as a low table in front of it and a desk plus chair along the right wall. A set of dark wood cabinets stands along the inner wall next to a matching door that you’ll check out shortly. The outer wall is mostly window; you peek under the curtains to look outside, but there’s not much to see in the foggy darkness. You’ll check again in the morning.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1163159418582614076 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1163159418582614076><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, October 15, 2023 1:00 PM">1:00 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The door by the cabinets leads into your new bedroom. There’s a set of shelves and a full-length mirror on the right wall, a set of closet doors in the far left corner, and a bed with pristine white sheets in the far right. To your left, another door leads into a spacious bathroom finished with clean tile of the same color palette as the rest of the room. White, grey, or silver with dark wood and occasional golden-brass accents. The sink countertop even looks like marbled stone, but it’s so smooth! It’s such a difference from the home you woke up in just this morning and its worn-down wooden everything. Is this what all the new apartment blocks are like as well, or is it just the Cathedra that’s so fancy?

    You almost sit down on the bed, but notice a neatly-folded uniform resting on the pillow before you get there. The tailors work fast, it seems; you pick it up and unfold it to get an idea of what you’ll be wearing.

    Thankfully, it’s only three pieces and doesn’t seem to be too elaborate. There’s a simple white top of similar design to your tunic, but with actual sleeves and made of a thicker material. A pair of close-fitting grey trousers with fairly stretchy fabric and a few silver accents. And a white outer coat - surprisingly light for its thickness - with more silver designs than the other pieces.

    Definitely more practical than the one-piece almost-dress of a tunic you’re wearing now; you’ll be able to move around pretty easily in it and won’t get cold from a March breeze. You are a little concerned about all the white and light grey, but figure maybe the Cathedra has some advanced laundry technology. Surely they wouldn’t want Angels to go out into the city in easily-stained uniforms.

There’s even a variation with a heavier coat, presumably for cold weather. How could they possibly have tailored all these for you in the few hours since you arrived? And they’ll have to do it again before too long - you aren’t done growing yet!

    Uniform successfully stored, you turn off the mechanical lamp before leaving your bedroom. You know you’re not paying for the steam to run it, but twelve years of growing up where your parents <em>do</em> means you’re conscious of this sort of thing. Someone’s paying for it, after all. At least it’s not an actual flame-based lamp; you could never get the hang of pouring the oil in and kept spilling it on the table. The mechanical ones are much easier, though of course they can’t move because of the pipes.

    ... You’re all fired up again after exploring your room. It’s still not <em>late</em> late and you’re not tired yet. Sister Noll did say you could do whatever you wanted tonight, as long as you got to Oth Hall on time in the morning. It might be a little scary to go wandering around the darkened campus in the nighttime fog, but you can at least go look around the rest of Hearth Hall, right?

    Having forgotten your earlier trepidation of running into someone and having to hold a conversation, you go put your shoes back on and leave your room. The interior hallway is quiet and moodily lit this time of night; the mechanical lights in the ceiling seem to be glowing more dimly than they could, casting the whole building into partial shadow. A portion of apprehension returns, but your curiosity remains stronger for now. The little edge of worry almost makes it more exciting, especially since you know you’re actually completely safe. Probably. No, definitely.

Your room is right on the end, across from 301 and directly next to the stairwell you hadn’t known existed when you went up the central one. It looks basically the same as the central stairs and there’s not much else there, so you leave it alone and walk the other way instead.

    You had been rushing too quickly to make note of it on the way up, but there’s a common area on this floor as well. Unlike the one downstairs, there’s no one here - you check for any errant blanket piles to be sure - but the rest of the room is pretty much the same. Comfy seating, a few tables, some miscellaneous books or other items that someone probably left behind. It suddenly occurs to you to wonder where everyone is getting these books; you don’t recall a library on your tour. Maybe you should ask tomorrow. Yara would probably know, if he’s that much into reading.

    You distract yourself for a few minutes by wandering around the room and checking the titles of the books on display. Most of them are annoyingly practical - history, magical theory, or combat techniques - but you do spy a few fiction texts lurking beneath other volumes. You suppose maybe people are just more likely to leave certain kinds of books behind and the rest would be in their rooms.

    As you’re pondering, you hear a door opening down the hall. You half-jump as if you’re about to be caught doing something bad and scramble for some sort of excuse or reason you would be just poking around the common area. Unfortunately, you don’t come up with anything in the few seconds it takes for the opener of the door to come into view. Fortunately (or not?) they seem just as surprised to see you.

(Was Yara glowing? You didn’t notice, but it had been brighter downstairs.) Observantly, you notice that she’s not wearing the uniform; just clothes with a similar color scheme. Still, she’s obviously an Angel - even without the glow, she’s far too pretty to be fully human. You briefly wonder when that will happen to you, but set that thought aside for the moment.

    “... Ah, you wouldn’t happen to be... J-Jessamine?”

    You’re not sure which of you is more nervous now. “Yes?”

    “Ah, good. Yara told me about you, a little.”

    “... I thought he had to go write a paper.”

    “He did!”

    “...”

    You’re pretty sure she’s more nervous than you, at this point. You’d better put your “excellent” social skills to use before things get even more awkward.

    <em>Scene 9</em>
    “W-well, sorry to bother you I’ll just be on my-”

    “Er, hang on; you know Yara? Does that mean you’re a trainee too?”

    “Well, h-he knows lots of people, but... yes.” She takes a breath; thankfully you don’t have to say anything else before she continues. “I’m, uh, Serri Ambrose. The newest Angel - well, <em>second</em> newest now.”

    “Ah!” You remember the news, though not the name; a whole season ago now. No wonder she looks so young; she’s only a few months older than you. “November, right?”

    A nod. She’s standing there as awkwardly as you must have been in the room downstairs just a little while ago. If only you knew how to break the ice, like Yara had done (perhaps accidentally?) by mentioning his paper. You don’t have any homework to put off at the moment, unfortunately.

    “S-sorry; I just got back and then I ran into Yara, so now I’m <em>really</em> late and I really need to get some food...” Serri takes a cautious step towards the stairwell, as if you’re going to jump out and stop her.

    Oh, that reminds you. “Actually, where do we eat?” you wonder aloud. “During the tour, it was just in the gardens, but I don’t know where she... um, would you mind showing me?”

    “Er-”

    “O-oh, sorry; I didn’t mean to be... If you don’t want to, that’s totally fine; I can find out in the morning.”

    “No, that’s okay. It’s just downstairs...”

    “Really? I must have really not been paying attention.”

    You follow Serri into the stairwell and start walking to the first floor. More questions come to mind and, despite your best efforts, you can’t stop yourself from asking. Maybe you spent all your willpower earlier. “What were you doing that meant you just got back? Does training go that late?”

    “...” She looks down at the steps, though that could be just to avoid tripping. “Not usually. I was just... I’m trying to get... better. Before Brother Cobb’s magic course starts.”

    “... Channeling my Soul. You’re supposed to learn how to do it in the first few months, but I still can’t get it right. And if I still can’t by June, then...” A pause, she opens the stairwell door for you. “I don’t think he’ll want to train someone who can’t even turn off her glow.”

    Ah! So maybe Yara <em>wasn’t</em> glowing at all. “... Sorry,” you say automatically, following Serri to a double-wide doorway you had vaguely noticed earlier, but really had been more focused on going upstairs. “There’s still lots of time before June, though. I bet you’ll be able to do it.”

    The room isn’t large, and looks more like a cafe than a cafeteria. A few tables are scattered around, but not enough to seat more than three or four groups. There’s a counter where someone would presumably prepare and provide food during the day, but at this time of night there’s no one there. Instead, Serri walks to a strange glass-fronted cabinet that appears to be stocked with various entrees. It’s also producing a humming noise, which strikes you as a thing cabinets don’t usually do.

    “Maybe,” she says, examining the selection for a few moments before opening the door. You almost jump at a wave of cool air; is the cabinet <em>creating its own cold</em> to keep the food for longer? “Yara tries to help, but it comes so naturally to him that he’s almost useless. ‘Just feel for it!’ Feel for what? Ugh, I’m sorry; now I’m just complaining. Do you want anything?”

Serri picks some sort of paste-filled bun and you sit down at one of the tables to eat. You’re still bursting with curiosity about Souls and magic and everything, but Serri seems pretty upset about it, so instead you ask “why June? Aren’t all these courses personalized? I mean, there are only two new Angels a year or so; you can’t do normal school-sized classes.”

    She’s starting to seem a little more relaxed after working on the sandwich for a bit. “Some of them are; some of them aren’t. Some courses work better when you’re paired up with someone, so they only hold those every year or something to try and make sure there are enough Angels. The basic magic course is one of them, since it really helps to work with a partner - especially for defensive practice. So Brother Cobb starts it every June on Founding Day and it goes through the end of the year. I’m in this June’s course - at least if I can figure out my Soul before then - and so is the previous new Angel from August. You probably will be too, at least if you want to learn magic right away.”

    “Yes! Who wouldn’t?”

    Serri actually half-smiles at that. “Yara says only one Angel since he got here didn’t take it as soon as they could. Of course everyone’s going to be excited about it.”

    ... Okay, she’s not as sad anymore and you really want to know. “This, uh, glow,” you begin, pointing to your still-shining arm. “You said... um, is it related to... Soul channeling? What does that mean?”

    The smile was short-lived. “Y-yeah. That glow is... I, uh, don’t freak out, but that <em>is</em> your Soul.”

    You blink. Look at your arm. Look at Serri. She doesn’t seem to be kidding. <em>“What?!”</em>

    “Look, don’t worry; it’s - when you Ascend, your Soul gets a lot stronger, right? That’s how Angels are different from normal humans, mostly.”

    “R-right...”

Out of you, a little?”

    “... My Soul is... leaking? Out of my arms?”

    “Not in a dangerous way, and it all comes back! But, um, yes, I think so. When you get better at Soul channeling, you can sort of reshape it and make it fit your Body better - and training your Body to be able to handle your Soul also helps - so most adult Angels don’t have to glow unless they want to. Even if you don’t do anything to channel it, your Body should adjust in less than a year anyway.”

    You still can’t quite get over the idea that your Soul - the very culmination of your being - is just leaking onto the table. It feels almost blasphemous.

    “Unless they want to?” you repeat. “Why would someone want to... uhm...”

    “Maybe if they’re somewhere really dark?”

    “...”

    “Only sort of kidding. But Yara is the Soul channeler, not me. You know I can’t even turn it off, let alone know why you’d want to turn it back on.”

    “I’ll help you,” you say impulsively (and a little bit self-importantly, you realize a moment later). “Er, I don’t know if I’ll be any good at Soul channeling either, but you said with magic it helps to practice with someone else, and... Yara is, um... too good at it...” You kind of lose momentum and just trail off.

    Serri stares at you for a few seconds before looking back down with a soft exhale and another half-smile. “You should at least wait until your first day before making promises like that. But... if you still want to after tomorrow, then... thanks.”

    You hang out with Serri for a little longer, then you both head back upstairs to your respective rooms. At this point, it is definitely late and you’re feeling the strain of a long day. Time to wash up, sink into bed, and do your very best to get some sleep before tomorrow.

    <em>Scene 10</em>
    You thought being your own nightlight might cause some trouble falling asleep, but it’s dim enough not to bother you with the covers muffling your glow. No dreams disturb you either and - after a brief moment of confusion in the morning before you remember where you are and why you’re not at home - you wake up rested and brimming with energy.

    Your face looks slightly strange in the mirror; you briefly wonder if you’re already changing to look more divine, but manage to convince yourself it’s still just the glow making the shadows weird. It hasn’t dimmed much at all overnight, but at least it’s only barely visible in the window’s foggy sunlight. Under mechanical lights, though, it’s pretty obvious.

    The cafe is much more obvious this morning and you have to try not to stare at all the Angels while you pick your way through the crowd to get some breakfast. You’ve never seen so many in one place. Then again, you had hardly seen any at all before coming here. There are a few Angels who look younger than the rest, closer to your age. Presumably these are your fellow trainees, but no one seems particularly interested in talking to you at the moment. Maybe you just blend in.

    “Oh, Jessamine, there you are.”

    You spin around to spot Yara, now in his uniform and looking much more put-together than last night. Well, at least until he yawns deeply and lightly slaps his face to wake up more.

    “... Up too late?” you ask.

    “Brother Trigg had better be happy. You’re looking chipper, at least.”

    “Sort of. I’m still a little nervous.”

    “Ah, be excited! Today, you get to learn some of the most thrilling secrets that will shape the rest of your life!”

    You pause, looking up from your browsing as he grabs a can of something from the shelf. “... What sort of things?”

Like...” He glances around for a moment. “Well, I was going to say something that isn’t very important, but it’s too early for that sort of thing. Or too late. Anyway, you’ll find out soon. Mornin’, Ets.”

    “Hey, Yara,” says a passing Angel with dark, short hair. She looks maybe a little younger than him, but it’s hard to tell. “Ready to lose today?”

    “Of course; I’m always ready to accept defeat with honor and grace. The question is whether <em>you</em> are ready for my glorious come-from-behind victory!”

    She rolls her eyes. “Good luck. You gotta get your nose out of those magic books if you want to stand a chance.”

    “Or is it that I must bury my nose even further within them, in order to uncover a hidden technique capable of besting even you in battle?”

    “Pfft. Not gonna happen. If you were going to...” She pauses for a moment, thinking. “You know, you’re actually crazy enough to try something like that. Pull out some secret move on the last day, just because it’d be dramatic?”

    A wink. “You know me so well.”

    “Well, you’re still gonna lose. Anyway, who’s this? Wait, didn’t someone just Ascend yesterday?”

    “Indeed, someone did! And her name is...” He gestures in your direction; you get the idea and finish his sentence.

    “I-I’m Jessamine.”

    “Etalyn. Fourth year trainee. I see you’ve met this clown already.”

    Yara chuckles as she whaps him on the shoulder. “Er, yes. Nice to, uh, meet you.”

    “Has he already gotten into your head with all the magical nonsense he loves to spout? Talking about Soul projection like it’s going to help him against the darkness?”

    “Er-”

    “Excuse you; external Soul projection is one of the most powerful techniques yet developed against the corruption.”

    “And external Soul <em>transmutation</em> is going to get you executed one day.”

    “I would never-”

I know you wouldn’t do anything like that. Just be careful of what it looks like, okay? You’re not as sneaky as you like to think.”

    Yara doesn’t say anything. You sit between them, confused and feeling more than a little out of place.

    “Sorry to you too, new kid. Jess, right?”

    “Er, yes.”

    “Just been meaning to tell him off ‘bout that for a while, and it sorta slipped out. Anyway, Yara here does love his magic - and he is good at it - but that’s not the only thing you need to train if you want to be an effective Angel.”

    “And an alive Angel!” Yara pipes up.

    “Shut - ugh, he’s right. Listen. You’re gonna get to pick your first few courses soon, and you might want to pick all magic for everything. Lots of young Angels get too excited about it. Just take my advice: don’t do that, and focus on the fundamentals first. Strong Body; strong Mind; strong support for your Soul. Think about it, alright?”

    “Alright...”

    Etalyn stands back up - she had been half-crouching to get closer to your level - and rolls her eyes again. “Lord above; I sound like a monk. Do what you want, Jess, just don’t be an idiot. See you around.”

    “And I’ll see you later for that secret technique!” Yara chimes in.

    “I look forward to it.”

    She’s out the door. You look up at Yara and just sort of gesture at him confusedly.

    “Oh, her? Yeah, Etalyn’s great, isn’t she?” He sighs, reminiscing. “I’ve never once beaten her, and I’m off to lose again today.”

    “Er... What about your hidden technique?”

    He waves his hands. “She’ll counter it somehow. I’ve tried all manner of tricks and still have yet to come close. Besides, it’s nothing <em>especially</em> special.” A pause, he glances at you. “Ah, but it might be special for someone who’s never seen anything like it before. You should come watch me get trounced!”

    “Um... is that okay...?”

    “... S-sure.”

    “Excellent! It’ll be sometime this afternoon; I’ll try to let you know when later. Anyway, we should probably get going soon; it won’t do to have you late for your first day!”

    He’s right. You finish up breakfast and head out with Yara to Oth Hall. It’s a mild, sunny day and the fog is light; you can almost make out the orb itself through the hazy grey ceiling. Of course, now you’ve got a bluish afterimage to blink away. Whoops.

    ... Soul transmutation. Yara brushed it off, but Etalyn clearly wasn’t happy. You instinctively go to ask him about it, but pause. Transmuting the Soul. The immutable, un-transmutable self. That’s... what the corruption does, according to what Yara told you yesterday. Should you really bring it up again? Is he going to give you a straight answer or just get annoyed? Etalyn’s a trainee too - albeit an intimidating one - maybe you could ask her instead? Or...

    <em>Scene 11</em>
    ... Maybe you shouldn’t ask anyone, at least not yet. You’ve only been here for less than a day and you’ve already gotten conflicting information and opinions from just about everyone you’ve met. Maybe you should try to find something a little more objective first? Speaking of...

    “Er, Yara, is there a library around here? I just noticed a lot of books and was wondering where everyone was getting them...”

    “Ah, taking an interest in additional knowledge so quickly! Yes, it’s situated within Oth Hall, deep inside the horrifying, madness-inducing confines of... well, the first floor. And some portions of the basement, but they don’t let just anyone down there.”

    “... Madness-inducing?”

    “I don’t like the floor plan.”

    “Well, um, can I just go in and... get whatever I want?”

    “Of course! As Angels, we must be educated on every imaginable matter of magic, combat, policy, the natural world; the list goes on! You are allowed to borrow whatever you need (except for things in the basement) just by virtue of your title. There’s hardly a greater repository of knowledge in all the city.”

    “You keep mentioning the basement; what’s... down there?”

    “Oh, nothing much. Just some particularly exciting tomes that are restricted to those who specifically ‘need’ them for ‘research’ or similar reasons.”

    “... You aren’t allowed to get something from there that you want.”

    “Very perceptive, you are,” he says dryly. “Yes, the monks keep telling me that a mere trainee shouldn’t yet be concerned with certain aspects of magic, and I haven’t yet gotten anyone to sign off on a research proposal. Infuriating how even here, so much information is kept hidden away in secret vaults.”

It seems like information on Soul transmutation is probably more than a little restricted, though, so you might have a harder time than you thought. Well, you’ll find out later. Too much going on to worry about that right now.

    “Ah, there’s everyone else,” Yara notices, pointing to a moderately sized crowd near the main doors to Oth Hall. “Still no Serri, though,” he continues, squinting. “Guess she’s really sleeping in.”

    There’s a very old-looking man in a silver-trimmed dark grey robe presiding over the group of young Angels, along with a few other similarly-robed people standing around nearby. At this point, you know that the robe indicates he’s a monk and likely one of your instructors. He notices your arrival and beckons you forward; Yara waves and joins the rest of the group to let you approach alone.

    “Good morning, Angel Jessamine Goodall,” he says, greeting you with the sign of the matan. His voice is scratchy, like he needs some water. “I am Brother Lemuel Cobb, head instructor of trainee Angels. I also teach a number of basic and intermediate courses on magic and Soul. Are you doing well so far?”

    “Er, yes.”

    “Good. Today, we have briefly gathered all of your fellow trainees. Ordinarily, you will work by yourself or in smaller groups, but first introductions are always important, yes?”

    The next twenty minutes or so pass both very quickly and terribly slowly. You do your best to avoid tripping over your words too badly as you give a brief introduction, then do your best to pay attention as everyone else gives one as well. It’s next to impossible to remember everyone’s names and other little tidbits, but you do really try!

Obviously, there’s yourself as the youngest, followed by Serri (who showed up just in time and earned a warning glance from Bother Cobb) and a boy called Erich who seems to be very precise about his movements and appearance. The two second years and two third years didn’t stand out as much in the middle, so you have embarrassingly already forgotten their names. Etalyn is alone as the one fourth year, chosen as the only worthy child to Ascend during all twelve Calling ceremonies of her year. There’s Yara as one of the fifth years, joined by Sims (who Brother Cobb interrupted to list his full name as Simly). Finally, the only sixth year is a young woman named Clarity with astonishingly red hair and a similarly colorful geometric pin on her uniform. Brother Cobb makes her take it off, but she puts it back on later when he isn’t looking.

    That’s it; all the other Angels leave. They really brought everyone here just for a twenty-minute round of introductions. You didn’t even get to talk to anyone in any detail. Yara does “coincidentally” pass you on his way out, dropping his voice to whisper a brief sentence. “Yeah, it’s dumb. There’ll be more tonight, though; tell you later.”

    Then it’s just you and Brother Cobb.

    “Well, there’s your cohort,” he says. “Of course, every Angel in the city is your peer as well, or at least will be once you have completed your training.”

    He pauses just long enough to make you think you should say something, but not quite long enough to figure out what you should say.

    “Anyway, come inside. I will go over some important information, then we will design your schedule.”

    You follow. He doesn’t say anything else as you walk down the endless twisting corridors of the Hall of the Mind; you start to understand why Yara doesn’t like the floor plan. It feels like the building must be bigger than it actually is, given how many rooms are packed inside.

He’s seemed fairly easy to annoy so far, given his responses to the other Angels’ behavior, and it seems you’re going to be with him for a while.

    On second thought, he’s been pleasant enough to you so far, and it’s not like there’s anything secret about these people walking about in public. “Er, Brother Cobb, what are those people doing with the... cases?”

    He half-turns, but doesn’t slow. “Research, young Angel. Tell me, what is a Mind?”

    “Um...” You hesitate, trying to come up with something brief but useful. Ah, the church’s definition? “It’s the connection between your Soul and your Body.”

    “A reasonable answer, but incomplete. Tell me, do animals have Souls?”

    “... No?” That’s one of the church’s foremost teachings. Humankind is unique among all life on the planet in possessing Souls; they are what separate people from beasts.

    “But they do have Minds. How would a chicken or a dog recognize their human master without one? But without a Soul, there is nothing for the Mind to link to the Body. So your definition needs some revision; try again.”

    “...” It’s hard to come up with anything while you’re still walking, and relatively quickly to keep up with the taller monk’s strides! “Um, a Mind is what tells the Body what to do?”

    Brother Cobb seems pleased; his tone changes slightly. “Better. The Mind, as best we can tell, is the aspect of the self that stores memories and personality, and the aspect that directs the Body’s conscious actions. If a being possesses a Soul, such as a human, the Mind links Body and Soul in order to channel one’s true self into their everyday actions, filtered through the lens of their personality and experience. For those with no Soul, the Mind still performs this task - merely without a higher authority to guide its decisions. Yes?”

    “Y-yes.”

    “So, what are these researchers studying? They are studying the Mind.”

    He seems to consider the question answered, but you’re still curious about the cases. Hesitantly, you-

You had already forgotten he’s prone to long pauses. “Merely blessed containers used to transport various tools from place to place. Certain implements used for examining or manipulating the Mind must be kept pristine - free from any contamination - in order to ensure the safety of those performing experiments, as well as those undergoing treatment. Just as a physician of the Body must purify his tools before operating, so too must a surgeon of the Mind keep his tools clean.”

    “I didn’t know you could operate on the Mind like you can the Body,” you admit, not sure what you think about that. It seems dangerous, but at least it’s not... “C-can you operate on the Soul, too?”

    “No,” Brother Cobb says sternly. “The Soul is one’s immutable true self, and it cannot be tampered with by similar processes. Anyone who says otherwise is lying, misinformed, or delving too deeply into the techniques of the corruption we fight. You shall speak no more of such matters.”

    You shut up, but don’t stop thinking about it. The corruption is a sickness of the Soul, Yara had said. Etalyn’s accusation of his interest in external Soul transmutation. Even Sister Noll’s explanation of Blessings leads you to think that the Soul is much more changeable than you had always been told. You know there’s more to the story, but clearly Brother Cobb isn’t interested in telling it. You’ll have to find out more on your own later.

    “You seem to be the inquisitive sort,” he notes as he finally leads you out of the hallway and into a much larger room packed with books; this must be the library Yara told you about. It’s well-frequented, based on the number of people currently poking through the shelves or reading at various tables throughout. “That curiosity will serve you well at the Cathedra, so long as you take care to avoid chasing after secrets that have been forbidden.”

Soul transmutation, as I mentioned earlier, is one of those topics. Its domain lies within the darkness; only expert Angels with decades of magical experience have any hope of finding useful secrets in that field. Anyone without that experience <em>will</em> cause grievous harm to themselves or others, and some topics are even worse.”

    Another pause. “Anything in the general archive is open to you at any time, however, including all manner of mundane topics and a vast array of magical texts. Many have been penned by Angels like yourself and will be a great help in your practical studies. Please make use of this library to better yourself and serve God as the best Angel you can be.”

    “I-I will.” Well, it seems you were right about Soul transmutation being more than a little restricted. Maybe there’s something about the general idea in the regular archive, at least. You’re starting to get really obsessed with the topic, even though you shouldn’t. Probably <em>because</em> you shouldn’t. Brother Cobb really should understand that.

    “Anyway, here are a few foundational texts you should pursue during your first weeks here. I would recommend <em>Angelic Biology</em> as the one to start with; it is written by an Angel and describes the changes you should expect as you grow into your new form.” He hands you a relatively slim book, then goes back for more. “Then, there’s basic Soul theory - useful if you intend to delve into magic as soon as possible - as well as similar introductions to Body and Mind.” Another three onto the pile, all much thicker. “Of course, your mundane studies shouldn’t be neglected either...” Texts on math, language, sciences, and the like make their way onto the stack. You’re starting to struggle to keep your grip.

Your arms feel maybe a little stronger than normal (though you may be deluding yourself), but even so, you can’t hold them all for long. Thankfully a nearby monk (librarian?) offers to deliver them to your room; you gratefully accept.

    Finally, Brother Cobb takes you over to a smaller office-like room not far off the library, nodding at the papers and writing implements someone has left here for you. “Time to work out your initial schedule. But first, I am required to inform you of four major changes that you underwent the moment God chose you in the Calling chamber. Most changes to your Body, Mind, and Soul will be more gradual, but these four are boons that all Angels share.” Another pause. “Of course, <em>Angelic Biology</em> does a much better job explaining, but here we are.

    “First, Bodily perfection. You must have already noticed that all Angels are young and of flawless appearance; this is no mistake. Your aging will slow over the next one to two decades until it finally stops, keeping your Body in its physical prime indefinitely.”

    You open your mouth, but Brother Cobb waves you down. “It’s all in the book; just let me get through the requirements, please.

    “Second, divine immortality. The Emissary asked you to swear your immortal, divine loyalty to God and the Cathedra, and that was not an exaggeration. You will not die unless you fall in battle or to the corruption; ordinary illness and old age hold no power over you.”

    “-”

I personally am against you young Angels hearing about this at all, but it’s better to learn about it - and its limitations - properly than from hearsay. The first time in your - theoretically infinite - life that you would die, God will save you. You will return to perfect health over several seconds, but <em>that is it.</em> Nothing will stop whatever killed you from doing it again after those few seconds, so <em>do not rely on this.</em> Too many young Angels think they’re invincible and get themselves into impossible situations.” A pause; he stares at you. “Do you understand?”

    “... Y-yes?”

    He sighs. “It’s in the book. Why do we even - ahem. Fourth, a divine Soul. Obviously, your strong Soul is what allows you to harness magical effects, but it can do more than that. When under great stress, you can manifest your Soul physically, converting your Body into - simplifying dramatically - an avatar of the Lord Himself. Almost nothing will be able to stand up to you in that form, but it will burn away your Soul in only minutes, leaving you nearly dead at the end of it. You’ll need weeks to recover, at the very minimum. Just like the second chance, you should <em>never</em> rely on this last, desperate ability.”

    “...”

    He rubs his temples. “Read the book; it will make more sense. Honestly, <em>why</em> they consider this to be day-one information...”

    “... I-if I have questions, should I, er-”

    “Yes, please hold them until you have done your reading. I will be willing to answer once you have.”

    You awkwardly sit down and look over one of the papers; it’s a block of information on a course about swordplay. You wonder if maybe the reason Brother Cobb doesn’t like giving out this information is because he rushes through it and doesn’t take any questions. Treacherously, you wonder what he possibly could have done to earn the “head instructor” position, but you quickly try to banish that thought. You don’t know him very well yet; maybe he can still surprise you!

    <em>Scene 13</em>
    There’s a lot you’d like to learn about, but unfortunately there’s only one slot to fill. Well, there were two, but of course you signed up for the basic magic course immediately. So, one.

    Still, after sorting through the descriptions for all the available courses, you end up picking history for... pretty much the same reasons as Yara told you he had. Brother Trigg’s description promises not only information on Nucarreo’s founding through the present day, but also how the corruption started and what happened to get to today’s relatively stable state. Given all the conflicting information around it, you’re hopeful to get a fuller understanding. Brother Cobb seems to approve.

    Then, after your schedule is settled, you... go back to school. Well, sort of. It’s more like tutoring than a traditional classroom - one monk instructs either just you or a small group of trainee Angels. Aside from that, it’s basically the same mundane subjects you were learning just a few days ago. You suppose it’s probably good to make sure you still get an ordinary education too, but it’s hard to be excited about ratios and equations when you could be studying magic or the corruption.

    You learn that Oth Hall has a cafe too - most of the main buildings seem to have one - and sit down for lunch amidst a number of monks, regular staff, and other Angels. Despite your best efforts to look friendly (or at least unintimidating), the staff keep their distance. Most of the monks do the same, though more out of deference than concern; these seem to be mostly the lighter-robed researchers rather than the seemingly more important dark-robed instructors. The Angels, in contrast, are more intimidating to <em>you</em> than the other way around (presumably despite their own best efforts!), so you end up by yourself.

    Well, you do for a few minutes, at least, until Serri shows up and quietly asks if she can join you. Of course you don’t mind and slide over a bit to make room.

    “Oh.” Was that the only reason she came to find you?

    “He says the match is going to start at afternoon bell and it’ll be on the west side of Forger Hall.”

    “O-okay. I don’t think I have any courses then...” You pull out your schedule to check; Serri glances at it.

    “You’ve got all normal subjects in the morning, too? It’s like they really want to make it hard to get up since the interesting ones aren’t till after lunch.”

    “Er, I don’t really have trouble getting up...” Even when you aren’t filled with new Angelic energy, you’ve always been good at mornings. Seth isn’t, which often led to you waking him up before school. You wonder how he’s going to get to class on time now.

    “A-ah. I’m... not.”

    “...” You would say something about how she was almost late this morning, but you don’t want to be mean just for the sake of having something relevant to say. Talking to her wasn’t this awkward yesterday, right? “Uh, hang on, why did Yara send you to deliver a message? He can walk, too.”

    “He said he needed to practice his secret technique.” Serri shakes her head slowly. “I don’t know what it is, but I don’t think he’s going to beat Etalyn. She’s really good.”

    “Is she?” You’re still not sure what you think of Etalyn. “What are these matches like, anyway? Is it like a contest, or...”

    “It’s, um, well, there’s an adult Angel who puts wards on both of them to, you know, make sure they don’t die. And then... it’s basically just a fight to the not-death. The monks say that’s what it can be like out in the wastelands.”

    You blink, not really expecting the answer to be so violent. “Really? Just a... a fight? I guess it makes sense, but that’s a little... brutal?”

    Serri looks away. “That’s what we’re meant to do: fight the darkness. That’s why God chose us, right?”

    “I - I guess.”

It’s fun too, or at least that’s what he says.”

    You’re still not sure, but you’ll go anyway. Your last course ends shortly before the bell, so you should be able to make it.

    “Oh, that reminds me,” Serri continues. “Apparently it’s, um, sort of a tradition for all the trainee Angels to get together the night after a new Ascension since, er, Brother Cobb doesn’t... um.”

    “I think I get it. This morning was a little weird.”

    “Y-yeah. So I just wanted to let you know, in case you don’t like surprises or something. It’s not like, a <em>party</em>, but maybe you can talk to some of the others you haven’t really met yet.”

    “T-that could be nice.” You start to imagine the other ten trainees all focused on you for who knows how long. The older, really intimidating ones. “Er, it’s not <em>just</em> about me... right?”

    “Ah, yes! I-” Her voice gets much quieter. “-hardly talked to anyone on my first day...” A quick recovery; back to normal volume. “So, uh, you’ll be okay.”

    “... Okay.”

    You turn to less important topics for a bit, talking about your respective mundane courses and the day’s work. It turns out you’re both at roughly the same spot in the curriculum, which you suppose makes sense as you both would have picked up from where you left off in ordinary school. Still, you have more courses in the afternoon, so you say goodbye to Serri and head off to learn about the fundamentals of Body, Mind, and Soul.

Apparently. Your first course of the afternoon is the fundamentals of Mind, which means you have to make your way through the maze of Oth Hall to find it. Here, you start with (oddly enough) some perception games; you have to identify hidden sights, sounds, or other effects as quickly as you can. It’s tough work, especially when they start making noises behind your back and asking you to turn around just before someone is about to bonk you with a fake wooden sword. This... you are uniquely bad at, failing to catch your instructor every single time. He tries to reassure you - “it’s okay; most new trainees take months to develop their senses sufficiently” - but you’re upset anyway.

    Soul fundamentals are taught in Illim Hall - or rather, in the garden just behind it. Your instructor asks you to look at a candle flame dance in the breeze, then describe how it interacts with the glow that still spills from your Body. You... don’t see anything, really - it’s too bright outside - so you move on to a few other mediums. Leaves, water, fat little bees; you still don’t understand what you’re supposed to be looking at. After that, you’re given some water and crackers; asked to take tiny sips or nibbles and focus on how your glow reacts to the nourishment. <em>This</em> time, you almost feel like you get something - there’s a sensation of... well, something! - but you can’t quite describe it. Your instructor seems pleased enough that you felt anything at all, at least.

You’re not very good at it, and despite your best efforts (and the training guard on the sharp edge) you do somehow manage to clobber yourself with the blade and walk away with a hefty bruise on one arm. Being an Angel does not automatically make you graceful and perfect, you repeat to yourself. No, clearly not. Ow. Your instructor says you should be pretty well healed by the morning, at least; your Angelic Body is really good at repairing itself.

    <em>Scene 14</em>
    Well, you did... okay, you think. Certainly not a prodigy, but you’re just starting out. No one can expect to be perfect right away.

    You close your eyes for a moment, focusing on your glow again, and try to sense how it’s reacting to the bruise on your arm. There’s... something. Similar to what you felt earlier when you were eating? It’s like... agh, it slips away. You’re not sure, but you <em>are</em> definitely getting better at sensing like this. Maybe in a few more days you’ll even be able to describe what the sensation feels like!

    Anyway, you’re done with training for the day and the afternoon bell should ring any minute now. The fog glimmers with yellow-orange light as the sun begins to set somewhere far above. You’ve got to get to Forger Hall if you want to see the match. The, uh, fight. That still makes you a little uncomfortable, but you suppose you had better get used to it. Serri’s right; the primary duty of you as an Angel is to fight against the darkness. You are a soldier now, or at least you will be.

    ... Kind of a sobering thought. That promise you gave the Emissary - to sacrifice your life for the Cathedra if need be - swims back to mind, but you push it away as best you can. Not something you want to think about right now. Luckily, you’ve got a distraction.

    The sparring grounds aren’t packed, but there are a fair number of Angels and Cathedra staff present to watch. You quickly spot both Yara and Etalyn on the field itself; they’re standing with a tall Angel who seems to be doing <em>something</em> magical, based on the whirling of wind around the trio. You assume that must be the ward to make sure they don’t die.

However, you only make it part way before you swerve around a pair of monks and almost run into the redhead Angel from this morning. The sixth year; what was her name? Quick, better remember before she-

    “Hey, Jess!” she says brightly, clearly having remembered <em>your</em> name without issue. Wait, <em>clearly.</em> Ah, her name is- “Have a good first day?”

    “H-hi, -” You almost say “Hi, Clarity,” but chicken out at the last moment just in case you’re wrong. Instead, you just pause awkwardly for a moment before answering her question. “I... uh, mostly.”

    “Hmm!” She glances down, noting the bruise on your arm with a sympathetic nod. “Body training get you? Ha; I was just like that back when I started. Except that was after they took the training guard off.”

    You blink in surprise. “You, um-”

    She giggles in a way that seems unfairly pretty. Your laugh doesn’t sound like that. “Nearly cut my hand off; I dropped the blade and tried to catch it! And with a starmetal weapon, well!” She leans a little closer, almost conspiratorially. Although she still has to talk fairly loud to be heard over the crowd. “So if you can avoid that, I think you’re doing just swell. Remember, us girls don’t have the boys’ advantage - they already had basic combat training.”

    That’s right, actually. While you were learning how to handle records and mathematics, Seth was learning how to fight. He probably would have already known how to use the sword that you fumbled today. “I didn’t think of that.”

    “Heh; I think we’ve got the better end of the deal, though. Don’t have to start off with accelerated math since we’re already caught up. Hey, who are you rooting for here?”

    “Er-”

    “Oh, whoops, you probably don’t know either of them. Yara’s-”

    “I-I’ve met him. And, er, Etalyn too. A little.”

You must be a real social butterfly, since I saw you with Serri too! Making so many friends so quick; you go! So, you know he’s never won a bout against her?”

    “Y-yeah. But I don’t know... why?”

    “Oh, that’s easy. Etalyn’s really good at fighting, while Yara’s spread out his focus. She’s good at internal Body projection, which... hum, you haven’t taken the basic course yet, but I think you can get the idea from the name, right?”

    “Er, magic that affects the inside of your Body?” You don’t really know what “projection” means, but figure maybe Clarity (is that actually her name?) will tell you.

    “Almost! The internal / external names just mean whether it works on you or something outside of you. And projection just means... uh, hum. It’s... well, whatever; Etalyn’s good at magic that enhances her own Body. And with her legitimately good sword skills - even without magic - that makes her a powerhouse.”

    Well, you feel a little better about “projection” now. “And Yara?”

    “He’s got more tricks, but they’re all weaker ‘cause he knows so many. His thing is physical projection magic, but he can do it internally or externally and got really good at switching targets. I think he can swap in under seven seconds now, which is super impressive for a trainee! Plus, he even started learning transmutation, but I don’t think he’s as good at it yet.” She pauses, sorting through her words to figure out what you might not know. “Okay, uh, just know that Yara is good at doing magic with the environment around him. That’s, yeah, that’s basically his thing. But... he’s not really good at fighting without it.”

    “I - I see.” You’re not sure what to make of all the magic terminology, but you don’t want to bother her by asking. Plus, it seems she <em>might</em> not be all that sure herself, and that would just be more embarrassing. “So she’s just a better fighter, and that’s how she wins so much?”

    “Erm, I’m not sure...” You don’t even know what his <em>regular</em> techniques are, let alone a secret one.

    “Well, I think he’s gonna put up a great fight... but still lose. I just don’t see Etalyn letting him beat her on the last day, y’know? She’s just so competitive. Oh, but maybe that’s his plan; mind games to psych her out. They’ve got such a weird rivalry; those two.” A pause; she looks back at you. With somewhat of a start, you notice her eyes are just as red (orange? pink?) as her hair. Are those lenses? Or...? “Anyway, you think he’s gonna win?”

    <em>Scene 15</em>
    “Probably... not.” Everyone else seems to agree, and you really don’t know anything about how well either of them might do. Besides, it’s not like Yara can get upset about your lack of belief in him; he’s all the way over there. “Um, by the way, your eyes are...”

    “Oh, this?” She points at her face and does a long blink; her eyes are now a much more natural shade of light green. “It’s just practice! I do it with my hair, too, but that’s also to annoy Brother Cobb.” Another brief gesture and her hair fades from <em>bright</em> red to just regular ginger. She pulls a section of it aside so you can get a good look, then concentrates and returns its fiery color, following up with her eyes a moment later.

    “Wh - how... it’s magic, I think, but is that... permanent?”

    “Sort of? Not really? I’m practicing internal Body transmutation, which is kind of advanced. It usually goes back to your natural form after a while, but if you keep at it, they say you can actually make permanent changes. I think I’m making progress on brightening up my hair, so I started working on my eyes too. It just takes a <em>lot</em> of patience; I’ve been doing this for a year already!”

    “J-just to annoy Brother Cobb?”

    “Hehe; no, silly. ‘Cause I like it! But annoying Cobb is a nice bonus; he’s so drab.” A pause, she considers something. “Also, ‘cause this kind of magic is how you get wings that-”

    The afternoon bell rings. Clarity cuts herself off - “It’s starting!” - and hurriedly turns towards the field. You follow suit, ready to see what the fight will be about.

    The tall Angel from before stands on the opposite side of the field from the crowd. Yara and Etalyn both stand in small marked circles a fair distance apart, warily facing each other. There’s a pause, then a whistle.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1168193349304451102 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1168193349304451102><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, October 29, 2023 10:23 AM">10:23 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Etalyn draws her blade and rushes forward, sprinting across the sandy field with astonishing speed and balance. Maybe she’s trying to finish the fight before Yara can try his secret technique? If so, even the few seconds it takes is too slow.

    Yara pushes both arms out in a wave, releasing a whirling shockwave of air. Etalyn has to leap aside to avoid being blown away; the blast hits the sand near the field’s center instead and throws up a massive dust cloud. Yara doesn’t slow down either; he swivels and fires another airblast, then another, and several more. Etalyn gets closer with each blast, moving towards him in a sort of spiral pattern, but there’s so much dust in the air now that you’re having a hard time seeing what’s going on.

    Then, after one more blast, everything goes quiet. There’s too much sand; you can hardly see the field and have lost track of both fighters. Clarity murmurs something beside you. “I wonder what he’s trying? She can’t see him, but he can’t see her either. Maybe something with the Mind - but, no, that’s... hmm!”

    You cough in the dusty air, bringing your shirt up to cover your nose. A number of spectators are moving away from the field to get out of the cloud. Suddenly, Yara appears on the very edge of the field, hands outstretched towards the center and focusing intently. There’s a long, drawn-out pause, then...

    Spreading from his hands and extending to every corner of the cloud, dust particles turn from brown to black and fall from the sky with an ever-increasing splattering roar. You gasp and take several steps back, but it’s too late; you and everyone else in the crowd are sprinkled with black goop that somewhat resembles tar as the dust transforms. Still, it’s much more concentrated on the field - a sticky layer of the stuff reaches several inches thick across most of the former sand. And a human-shaped lump in the opposite corner suggests that Etalyn has definitely not gotten away from the downpour unscathed.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1168193427918295162 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1168193427918295162><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, October 29, 2023 10:23 AM">10:23 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>You start to get excited despite yourself as Yara drops his hands, scans the field, then runs off towards the corner. He’s struggling to keep his footing on the tar, though, alternating between sliding and getting stuck on the surface. The lump wriggles more violently as he gets closer, particularly along one side where - just a few steps out - a sword manages to break free. She scrambles out of the layer of tar only an instant before Yara arrives, absolutely coated in the stuff and clearly heavily weighed down by it.

    He manages to score a hit as Etalyn spins to face him; she takes a deep gash down her side that paints the black, sticky floor with shockingly deep red blood. You look around frantically, watching for someone to call the match, but no one does. She fights on regardless, slowed and grimacing against the wound but skill undiminished.

    From there, it only takes maybe twenty seconds to finish it. Yara fights decently, but Etalyn isn’t as hurt as she looks - or maybe she’s just really good at ignoring the pain - and fights much better than “decently.” Neither Angel uses any more magic, and even with the wound and sticky coating, Etalyn manages to drive her blade home in short order.

    You wince, then cover your eyes entirely as a brilliant burst of golden-white light flashes out. Yara and Etalyn are both thrown away; he picks himself up moments later - tar coating the back of his uniform - and laughs heartily. The tall Angel swoops in, blowing the whistle to declare the match over - and then a second burst of light explodes from where Etalyn had landed.

    She stands up as well, wiping goop off her face and uniform, and marches over to Yara as the tall Angel proclaims her the winner. She looks far more angry than you would expect since she just won, but Clarity thankfully has you covered with her post-match commentary.

No wonder she’s so mad; she ‘died’ just a few seconds after he did! If he’d been able to hold out just a little longer with that sword fight, or maybe if he’d been a little quicker getting over there-” She shakes her head appreciatively. “I’m impressed; that’s one cool trick he pulled off.”

    “Th-the second light was... er-”

    “Yeah, that was her ward going off too. Means her injuries were bad enough the spell thought she might die if it didn’t do something, so it blew up and healed her just like Yara’s did. Maybe part of it was the fall from his explosion knocking her around, but it must sting to have been so close to losing. New experience for her, you know?”

    “Y-yeah.”

    “Hey, here comes your other buddy now. Serri, what’d you think?”

    You glance out to the field again as Serri arrives from the other side of the crowd. Etalyn and Yara bow to each other under the tall Angel’s instruction, then start making their slow, difficult way off the tar field. He seems to be animatedly telling her something, and you can see her responding in some way even though she still looks quite angry. What <em>is</em> their “weird rivalry,” as Clarity put it?

    [Not necessarily mutually exclusive. Pick as many as you’d like.]
    ✋ - You congratulate Yara on his narrow loss.

    <em>Scene 16</em>
    “Really impressive,” Serri says quietly. “That was transmutation, right? So it must have been really hard.”

    “Yeah, probably! Unless he figured out how to turn sand into gloop just by pushing energy into it, and something tells me he didn’t.”

    They chat a little more about magical mechanics you don’t understand quite yet, so you just listen without saying anything. You’re good at that. After a bit, Yara and Etalyn show up too and he immediately joins the conversation.

    “Ah, Jessamine, you did make it after all! Well, how did I do?”

    “Er, I haven’t seen any other matches, but, uh, congratulations on your, um, almost-win?” Feeling like everyone’s been emphasizing Yara’s accomplishments without acknowledging Etalyn’s skill, you turn to her as well. “And... good job to you too, on, er, your actual win.”

    She rolls her eyes, but nods anyway. Yara does a miniature bow. “Much appreciated. Any comments on my brand-new secret technique? Improvements?”

    “Try not to hit the spectators next time,” Clarity offers, showing off her speckled sleeve. “But it was very exciting to see; I didn’t know you could do transmutation like that!”

    “Ah ha! I’ve been branching out from my traditional projections for even greater flexibility! You see, it turns out that there’s actually very little manipulation needed to adjust the ‘stickiness’ of dust like this; I happened across a manuscript a while ago that...”

    You kind of lose focus. On top of not really understanding the complicated terms he’s using, you keep finding yourself glancing at Etalyn’s side or Yara’s stomach where their uniforms are torn from blades. The skin beneath is perfectly intact, but the white fabric is stained with blood. Everyone seems so casual about it, so you’d feel weird bringing it up, but...

    Etalyn waves a hand and you blink, snapping your gaze back to eye level again. “Hey, you okay, new kid? Spacing out a little.”

    “Er, sorry... I was just, er... it’s nothing important.”

    “...” You’re not sure, actually. Maybe it’s the blood, but maybe it’s just... “I - I don’t know. It just seems so...” You break off again, still trying to figure out what you’re thinking. “Angels are supposed to be holy, even in battle, but, er...”

    “It’s a bit more brutal than you thought, right? And the real thing’s even worse, accordin’ to the soldiers. Doesn’t seem to add up, huh?”

    You nod slowly. It makes sense; maybe that was the... dissonance you were feeling? It’s still hard to tell for sure. “I didn’t know what was going to happen. For a moment there, I thought, you know; there was just so much blood... Maybe something had gone wrong? Maybe you were in real danger? B-but, no, it was fine.”

    You’re not sure what point you’re trying to make anymore. Etalyn pats her side. “Good as new; promise. It can be a little tough at first, gettin’ used to what you’re gonna do on the battlefield. Mind training helps. You’ll get there, okay?”

    “... Okay.”

    Apparently Yara and Clarity have finished their conversation; now the redhead Angel has a different question. “Hey, Etalyn, I’m curious; why didn’t you stop the bleeding while you were fighting? You must’ve already been focused on internal Body from your spells earlier, and it probably would’ve helped you fight better. Plus, I bet it really hurt!”

    “Huh? Oh, no, I just knew I wouldn’t need to.”

    “Really? You’re that confident?” Clarity leans in a little closer; Etalyn looks away. “Or did you lose your fo~~~cus?”

    “...”

    “Come on, you can tell the truth! It happens to everyone, especially when you’re not used to getting hit!”

    “I’m... going to go clean up.” Etalyn spins and heads off, glancing back for a moment. “Yara. Good... match today. See you tonight.”

It does create somewhat of a mess, I have to admit. Perhaps that’s something to work on for the future.”

    “I wonder how long it’s going to take them to clean up the field?” Clarity wonders idly, rubbing at a spot of goop on her hand. “Do you know how to change it back?”

    “Perhaps!” Another brief pause. “But not tonight, as I am <em>out</em> of energy. I’ll discuss with one of the groundsmasters tomorrow and see if they would like me to attempt it.”

    No one says anything for a bit. Someone in a grey robe taps the goopy field with a rake. Yara eventually speaks up again. “I believe I’ll retire for some cleaning as well. And the three of you may wish to do the same, or at least change outfits. Perhaps I should make the sludge white instead of black so it blends into our uniforms better... In any case, Jessamine! Serri informed you about the gathering tonight, yes?”

    “Um, you didn’t ask me to say anything about that.”

    “I didn’t?!”

    “It’s okay,” you assure him. “We talked about it anyway. Just, er, not exactly when. Or where.”

    “Ah ha! In the downstairs common area after evening bell, I do believe. Most of us should be there, yes, Clarity?”

    “I’ll be there; don’t worry. Sims too, Etalyn just said so, and you three, of course. Hm; I’ll check with the younger ones as well, just to be sure.”

    “Excellent! With that, let us return and meet again in the evening.”

    Of course, you’re all going to the same building, so you stay together until you reach Hearth Hall. At that point, the group separates to their various floors and rooms. You’re not entirely sure how the laundry works here, but you’ve got plenty of spare uniforms that aren’t speckled with goop, so you’ve got time to figure it out.

    <em>Scene 17</em>
    Well, you did promise and it’s not like the book will vanish before you get back. Better get going... Still, you don’t want to be the first one there. Maybe you’ll just take your time putting the book away and getting your shoes on before finally (slowly) making your way to the door. Yeah, that’s a good idea. You’ll do that.

    It turns out your sluggishness wasn’t necessary; when you emerge from the stairwell into the ground floor common area, it’s obvious that several Angels have been here for a while already. There’s Yara and Etalyn over on the other side of the room, both with hair still damp from cleaning off all the tar. Clarity is nearby, telling some sort of story to the first year you recognize as Erich and one of the Angels whose name you forgot. Finally, there’s the fifth year named Sims, one of the other Angels you don’t recognize, and... that’s not one of the trainees.

    You try to slip past the closer group to make it to the people you know, but aren’t sneaky enough. It doesn’t help that there aren’t many people walking around the room at the moment, though there are a few other Angels getting dinner nearby. In any case, Sims spots you and waves you over before you can get away.

    “Well met, Angel Jessamine,” he says in his deep, loud voice. Sims is just plain big, from his height to his muscles to his voice. It’s hard to believe that he’s only 16; he’s even taller than the adult Angel sitting next to him... who seems very familiar for some reason. “May you serve the Lord well.” The sign of the matan; one of the more traditional greetings. At least, so you’ve gathered after less than two days.

    You return the sign as politely as you can, but stay quiet. You’re not really sure how to respond to that aside from “you too,” but that sounds way too awkward even in your head. Thankfully, the adult Angel introduces himself as well.

Officially Ezekiel, but you try calling a three syllable name in a fight. I believe Sister Noll spoke of you earlier.”

    “Ah!” You remember now; the two Angels sparring outside Forger Hall during your tour. One had been named Zeke. “Y-yes, I think we might have passed you yesterday.”

    “Zeke only returned from the wastelands several days ago and has been detailing his encounters with a <em>Shade</em>. It attacked during the exploration of a nearby ruin that some rail workers discovered. Why don’t you listen for a while? You’ll be going out there one day too.”

    You’re a little uncomfortable, but you are curious, so you reluctantly agree and Zeke continues where he left off. He talks of a Shade - a general of the darkness and a creature of grey-black ash and soot in its natural form, but able to shape and color its Body to resemble a human being. He recounts the creature raising waves of Mindless darkness from the ground, pulling sticky threads of tar-like substance directly from the scorched, poisoned earth.

    You can’t help but half-glance in Yara’s direction at that, remembering his “secret technique.” It doesn’t <em>seem</em> like there’s a connection, but he certainly doesn’t need any more negative attention given his interest in Soul transmutation. Still, right now it’s hard to be concerned as he laughs heartily at something Etalyn said; she even grins for a moment and shakes her head. Are they <em>actually</em> friends? It’s hard to tell.

    Wait. Is... is Zeke looking at him too? Is his just following your glance or-

    By the time you properly look back to trace his eyeline, you’re not sure. He’s back into his story, looking down as he acts something out with his hands. Not even facing in Yara’s direction. You’re not sure you even saw anything to begin with. Why are you so on edge now?
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1169819089007554581 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1169819089007554581><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, November 2, 2023 10:03 PM">10:03 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Anyway, Zeke is explaining how he fought the Shade to a standstill in order to give the ordinary soldiers time to retreat and regroup at a defensible location away from its hordes. Finally, he managed to escape himself with a feint that took one of the creature’s arms off and bought him an opportunity to manifest his wings. Apparently he’s quite proud of how quickly he can do that now, and hopes to make them permanent in the near future. You don’t care about that; you’re more curious than ever about what a Shade actually is and why a single one of them is dangerous enough to nearly overpower a full Angel and a squad of wasteland soldiers. So dangerous that a successful retreat without losing anyone is considered a victory. Aren’t Angels supposed to be near-invincible in battle? God’s perfect, unbeatable counter to the corruption?

    Well, you’ve already learned that Angels are far from the perfection that the church portrays. Perhaps you aren’t as surprised as you could be.

    ... Is Zeke... looking at <em>you</em> now? Again, you can’t quite tell; he’s innocently focused on Sims by the time you look back at him. You’re feeling almost crazy, like you’re seeing things. And even if he was looking at you, what of it? It’s not like - <em>there</em>, again! A flick of the eyes, just as you looked away. What could he possibly be-

    You rub at something itchy on your neck and come away with a bit of tar stuck to your fingers. Apparently you hadn’t been quite as thorough as you had thought, though to be fair you wouldn’t have been able to see that angle in the mirror. Zeke half-nods, then continues elaborating for Sims’ benefit. He... had he just noticed the tar? Was that it; nothing sinister about it? You’re still feeling a little creeped out, but you can’t give a definite reason why.

    <em>Scene 18</em>
    Thankfully, that feeling starts to fade over a few minutes as Zeke chats with Sims and you sit there awkwardly, no longer part of the conversation but not having explicitly exited the interaction. Can you just leave? Would that be rude? A glance sideways reveals that Yara and Etalyn have joined Clarity and the two younger Angels, who are now watching him spin little glowing orbs from thin air. Someone else tries, but ends up just creating a momentary flame. Laughs all around as one of the orbs pops from the heat.

    Maybe you can just sort of... get up and... oop. You had almost forgotten about the last person sitting nearby, who just noticed you getting up and stood as well. She’s one of the second years, you remember. A white beret on deep, glossy black hair (almost purple!) that nearly covers her eyes like a curtain. Of course, as an Angel, the effect looks more attractive than weird or asocial, which you still find unfair. If you did that with your hair, it wouldn’t look that good. Would it?

    Zeke looks up from his story, but doesn’t have time to say anything before the second-year Angel speaks in a very soft voice. “Sorry; don’t let me interrupt you. I just need to get a drink. Would you like one as well, Jessamine?”

    She’s offering you an opportunity to leave; you nod and step slightly closer so she can take the lead. Somehow, the situation feels almost tense again, with her and Zeke staring at each other, but then he just shrugs, looks away, and continues talking to Sims.

    You’re so confused; there’s a lot more going on here between all these Angels than meets the eye.

    True to her word, she leads you over to the cafe area and picks out a glass bottle of bubbly yellow-green liquid. You just go with water. She sits down to work on the bottle cap; you’re not sure if you should say something or sit as well or <em>what</em> is going on, really. Eventually, you decide to sit (since it doesn’t look like she’s leaving soon). “Er, thanks.”

Glad you stopped by so I had an excuse to leave.” A pause; a sip. “So, thanks to you too, I suppose.”

    “Wait - didn’t - wasn’t your excuse that you needed a drink?”

    “That was my <em>outer</em> excuse. Anyone could see through that, so I needed another excuse: getting <em>you</em> away from them. That’s just hidden enough to seem like the actual reason, but it still conceals the <em>actual</em> actual reason: that <em>I</em> wanted to leave.”

    “... Er, I... guess so?” It seemed pretty obvious to you that she wanted to leave.

    “I know what you’re thinking: ‘it seems pretty obvious that I wanted to leave,’ right?”

    “Uh-”

    “It’s the <em>reasoning</em> behind my desire that’s in question, though. If they just think I was bored or annoyed or whatever, then that’s good enough. You see? They don’t. Got it?”

    “...”

    The Angel laughs at your expression. “Sorry, sorry. Don’t worry about it; I overcomplicate everything. You can ignore me most of the time. Anyway, let me introduce myself again since I bet you forgot my name with everything that happened today. I’m Naoriel Fisher, second year.”

    She pronounces the “Nao” like in “Naomi.” It’s an unusual name; sounds very high class. Kind of like Ezekiel’s, if he didn’t shorten it to Zeke. “G-good to meet you. Again.”

    “I really did mean what I said earlier, by the way: be careful with those two.” She folds her arms, studying you. You’re not sure what she’s looking for, but apparently she finds it, nodding briefly. “Ever heard of an Inquisitor?”

    “No...”

    “Angels with a special extra duty to search out and remove any corruption (the political kind <em>or</em> the darkness kind) that makes its way into the Cathedra itself. They’re important to have around - to get rid of corrupt ministers and the like - but some of them can be a little... aggressive.”

    You catch on quickly. “... Zeke? And... I swear he was looking at, er-”

He shows up every so often to check on the trainees, even though that’s not necessarily his job, and... well, you saw. Even after just a few days, I bet you already know why he’s interested in Yara.”

    “... Yeah.”

    “So, don’t take this the wrong way and <em>definitely</em> don’t take it as an accusation of any sort of wrongdoing-” She narrows her eyes and you hastily nod in agreement. “- but just be careful what you say and do around people like Zeke and Sims. I don’t know much about you yet, but it won’t do you any good to get caught up in anything like that so early on. Well, probably not ever, really.”

    “... Right. I’ll... be careful.”

    Naoriel sighs. “Ugh, you’re tired of getting these warnings from everyone you meet, aren’t you? Dire prognostication.”

    You’re not sure what that last phrase means, but it sounds like a curse. Still, you <em>have</em> been getting a lot of warnings today. And she knew that you forgot her name, and what you were thinking about her excuses, and... “Are... are you just a good guesser, or are you, um, with Mind magic, or...”

    She blinks. “Am I reading your Mind?”

    “Err... yes.”

    Naoriel takes another moment to pause, then laughs again. “Oh, no no no. I’m just remembering <em>my</em> first day. Ah, thank you, though. I didn’t know I was <em>that</em> good.”

    “...!”

    It suddenly occurs to you to wonder why Naoriel had been sitting with Zeke and Sims in the first place. Surely she wouldn’t have done so on purpose, but if they went to sit with her, then wouldn’t that mean that she might also be suspicious, like Yara? Or maybe it was just a distraction, or a coincidence, or she had just been waved over like you were? Or are <em>you</em> already suspicious, too? And then there was all that about her inner or outer excuses. It’s... impossible to know, probably.

    <em>Scene 19</em>
    ... But by the time you work up the confidence to say anything, it’s been several minutes of unrelated conversation and she’s done with her drink.

    “I’m going to head out the other way,” she says, half-nodding towards the main entrance. “It was good to talk with you.”

    “Oh - okay. Er, good to talk with you too.”

    Naoriel nods again and stands up, glancing one more time over towards the rest of the group before leaving the building. Entirely? Does she not actually live here, or does she just have something else to do? You... still don’t really know anything about her, even after your chat.

    Anyway, you stand up yourself and (with some mental effort) decide to return to the main room. This time, you’re entering on the other side and a few other Angels have shown up to occupy Zeke, so you’re finally able to make it over to the people you know without being caught up in any other weird conversations. Serri showed up while you were in the other room as well, so the group is even larger.

    “Ah, Jessamine, finally escaped, I see.” That’s Yara, of course, letting his light orbs expire as you arrive. “Truly, you are making new friends at an astonishing rate. How did you get Naoriel to go have a cozy chat with you within minutes of meeting her?”

    “It wasn’t really my idea,” you admit, settling onto a proffered chair. “She just didn’t want to talk to them.”

    “Mm, mm. So secretive, that girl. Well, those two can be somewhat grating, so I suppose I don’t blame her.”

    “What’d you talk about? Anything <em>secret?”</em> Clarity this time, sliding in with a grin.

    “Er, I don’t know...” You’re not sure what counts as secret and you really don’t want to leak anything you shouldn’t. Especially with the warnings about Inquisitors. “Not really.”

    “Boo. She won’t even <em>talk</em> to me.”

    “That’s because you’re a gossip, dear.”

    “Slander!”

He doesn’t seem to mind. You’re not sure why she’s standing, until you realize the proffered chair had been hers. “Ahem, ‘noodly disposition.’”

    Yara cackles and Etalyn looks away with a grin. Clarity feigns outrage for a moment before laughing as well, presumably at some inside joke that you are very much on the outside of.

    “Hehe, alright,” she eventually relents. “Anyway, Jess, you’ve got two more people to meet! Here, you two introduce yourselves.”

    People rearrange themselves and you’re suddenly face-to-face with the two Angels you don’t know yet. There’s the boy you do remember - Erich, with a precisely groomed appearance and blue eyes moderately more saturated than your own - and another boy you don’t. He’s muscular and surprisingly dark-skinned; it’s not easy to tan in a city permanently doused in fog. Some people are just naturally like that, you suppose, but it’s fairly rare. Actually, Etalyn’s fairly dark-skinned too, now that you think about it. It’s just that you’ve only seen her in - you’re getting way too distracted! Pay attention!

    “Erich Haskell,” he says, taking your hand in a brief greeting. “First year. And this is Denn Ayburn.”

    “Nice to meetcha. Oh, I’m a second year.”

    “N-nice to meet you.”

    There’s a pause. Erich is looking at you, though he’s trying to hide it. You’re more uncomfortable than if he were - “Jessamine, pardon me, but have we ever met before?”

    Oh good, he had a reason. “I don’t - er, when? Where? Like, earlier today?”

    “No, no, years ago. My father manages a hospital in the sixth district, and I swear there was a girl who stayed for at least a y-” He notices your expression and cuts himself off. “My apologies; I shouldn’t have brought it up.”

    “J-Jessamine, are you okay?” Serri asks, speaking for the first time since she showed up.

    “I’m fine. I just-” Everyone’s looking at you. “I got sick for a while when I was little. I’m better now. That’s it.”

Erich keeps talking to you, perhaps because he feels bad about exposing you like that, but at least he’s talking about a more palatable topic now.

    “You will be joining myself and Serri in Brother Cobb’s course this June, then?”

    “Yeah.”

    “A fascinating concept, isn’t it?” he muses. “Using the Soul to manipulate other aspects. It makes you wonder if ordinary humans might be capable of magic, if they have strong enough Souls, or if there’s something unique about Angels that places us above humanity.”

    “Didn’t humanity used to have magic, back before the corruption?” Serri asks quietly. She stuck with you, Erich, and Denn, while the older Angels are playing some card game you didn’t have a chance to see. “Before God changed our Souls?”

    “Mm, yes, but did He then seal off humanity’s ability to use magic forever and grant it only to Angels? No one knows what God truly changed within them, just that there was some sort of change.” He does a long blink, beginning to glow much like yourself and Serri - you’d almost forgotten by now, but you’re still shining about as brightly as a dim lamp. “Perhaps everyone was like this back then. Jessamine, have you made any progress in controlling your Soul?”

    It’s only been a day! What kind of question - anyway. “A - a little, I guess. They had me try to focus on it while eating, and I definitely felt <em>something.”</em> You catch sight of Serri and wince internally; she’s already looking more dejected. “B-but it’s only been a day, so I haven’t really gotten anywhere...”

If you’re already getting some sensation, I assume you’ll make it.”

    You spare another glance to the side. Yeah, she’s not happy. He’s not... doing that on purpose, is he? Talking about competence like that? Should you... say something?

    <em>Scene 20</em>
    Conveniently, a new question occurs to you as you glance around the room for ideas of how to change the topic. “Where are the last two trainees?” you wonder aloud. “There were only...” A quick count (remembering to include the missing Naoriel) confirms it. “Nine of us here.”

    “Oh, who’s missing?” Erich looks around, but Denn beats him to it.

    “Emmett and Rhysa?”

    “Ah, those two. They’re training with the district constables, I believe. Should be back in a week or so.”

    “What sort of training?” You want to stay away from uncomfortable topics for Serri, but you are also legitimately curious.

    “It’s nothing special,” Erich assures you. “Just spending some time embedded in a precinct office to better understand how to work with regular constables. Supposedly it’s intended to improve goodwill and coordination between Angels and ordinary people. Really, though, it just helps us learn how to keep them out of our way.”

    “Y-you don’t know that,” Serri interjects. “You haven’t done it yet.”

    Erich shrugs. “True. But I have seen my fair share of the corruption even before I Ascended. Of course, you know that darkness tends to cling to places of suffering, and even the best hospitals are full of people in pain. I visited my father many times at work, and witnessed several incidents. Every time, the constables’ only job was to clear the area and keep people away so the <em>real</em> heroes - Angels - would have room to work.”

    You frown, thinking back to your time in the hospital. You don’t recall anything like that happening, but you had been pretty out of it at the time. Maybe you had just been too sick to notice; it was a pretty large complex, after all. Still, you’re not sure you like how he’s talking about “ordinary” people so negatively.

    “Well, th-they can’t purify monsters like Angels can, so it m-makes sense for them to stay back.”

    “I never said it didn’t. Just that the constables are objectively less important than any Angel.”

Now you’ve got to come up with another change of topic before things get even worse. You glance over to Denn, sitting peacefully beside Erich, as if maybe he can help you.

    “We’re still human, too,” he says calmly, patting Erich’s shoulder. “D‘spite all our blessings.”

    The younger Angel rolls his eyes. “Don’t go spouting that line at me again. I’m not saying anyone’s less of a human than anyone else, just that some people are better at some things than others. In this case, that Angels are better at fighting monsters than anyone else.”

    “Constable’n is a big job too,” Denn reminds him. “They gotta deal with all the human monsters.”

    “Well, not <em>all</em> of them. Depending on what you count as a monster.”

    “Not a human.”

    “A dog criminal?”

    Denn nods with a look of absolute seriousness. “Problem for an Angel.”

    “...”

    No one <em>laughs</em>, exactly, but there are several exhales and the tension lessens a bit. You shoot Denn a grateful look; he nods serenely. Seems like he must be used to this kind of thing by now.

    You stay downstairs for longer than you thought, joining the older Angels’ game after a few more minutes and getting absolutely destroyed by Yara’s ridiculous strategies. At least, during the first round. He doesn’t seem to get as lucky later on and you pick up on a few tricks of your own.

The common area is much more lively than it was yesterday, even around the same time as night closes in around the building. You bring that up and learn that the first of every month - Calling Day for ordinary children - typically involves a few hours of solitary reflection for Angels after the evening’s mass. You had been so busy with your tour and such that you hadn’t even noticed all the Angels disappearing shortly after dinner. Yara, of course, had decided to do his “solitary” “reflection” in the common area, with a book. You suppose it’s close enough.

    Some Angels come in with hair and clothes disheveled, sharing tidbits of missions they had just completed. You don’t hear much, but it seems one of the most common duties involves purifying Mindless darkness creatures inside the city before they can do any damage. It makes you wonder how common that sort of thing is. You’d never heard of any corruption making its way into the city before, essentially, today, but here are a number of Angels just returning from dealing with exactly that. Maybe it’s localized to a handful of places, and your neighborhood just never had much of a problem? It’s hard to know.

    Eventually, it gets late and you get tired. You say your goodbyes and head upstairs, relishing the quietness of the stairway and upper halls after the raucous gathering downstairs. Ah, you don’t have to talk to anyone. Glorious. Not that you didn’t enjoy your time downstairs; you’re just... socially exhausted. You slip into your room and close the door before anyone else can show up. Glance at the book you had neatly put into a shelf before heading down. You’re... maybe a little too tired to read that properly right now. Tomorrow.

    <em>Scene 21</em>
    “We will start today with a one-minute recap,” Brother Trigg calls, sliding a piece of mostly-transparent film atop the projector. You’ve never seen anything like it before, but through a combination of lenses, mirrors, and a powerful mechanical lamp, the shadows of his normal-sized images and writing are expanded to fill the opposite wall.

    You’re not alone here, either. Brother Trigg himself is present, of course: a squirrely old man with thin hair and thick glasses, he couldn’t look more like a historian if he tried. But although you’re the only Angel in the room, there are about a dozen monks-in-training and other Cathedra staff learning the same history as you. You do feel a little uncomfortable at the deference everyone but Brother Trigg shows you, but there’s only so much you can do. Yara told you he has the same problem in his more advanced course.

    “Genesis to year zero in one minute! Any volunteers?”

    The monk always starts each session the same way, by asking a student for a one-minute recap of the entirety of history up until whatever point you’ve currently reached. It’s already getting difficult to summarize and you’ve only reached year zero so far; there are still over 1200 years to go if he intends to catch up to the present.

    “Angel Goodall! Thank you for volunteering!”

    You wince briefly, but you were half-expecting him to pick you anyway. He’s a lot more demanding of your work than any of the other students (even though you’re many years younger than most of them!) and he’ll often single you out if no one else is responding. Not <em>always</em>, but certainly more often than if he were choosing at random. Of course, he’s not picking on you; he’s just “ensuring your time in the course is as useful as it can be.”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1175535753955119275 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1175535753955119275><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, November 18, 2023 3:39 PM">3:39 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Er, yes.” At least you’re getting over your discomfort of speaking in front of groups in record time; no one makes fun of you for getting things wrong, or even seems disappointed. That could just be the deference you had already noted, but you choose to believe otherwise.

    He starts the clock.

    “God originally came down from a higher dimension and created the world and life by dreaming it into existence. He watched from above for a long time before eventually giving humans Souls so we could have true selves as reflections of Him. Our Souls were originally open and allowed us to use magic and connect with everything else freely, but this was a mistake since the open Souls could mutate too freely, which created the corruption!”

    Thirty seconds left. Hurry! “We don’t know much about what happened as the corruption spread because so many records from that time were destroyed by war or the year-zero cataclysm. But we do know that the first Angels were blessed by God sometime a few centuries before year zero, though they were too few and inexperienced to fight back effectively.” Fifteen seconds; you try to talk faster! “The darkness made an all-out attack on humanity in year zero, but God broke the darkness’s Mind by sacrificing His own in order to stop it. That means as we started to rebuild, we didn’t have to face coordinated attacks, and Angels were able to defend us and create the Cathedra!”

    You quickly sit down and Brother Trigg stops the clock. Two seconds left; just in time!

    “Good, Jessamine. I believe there were two major events you missed in your summary, however; does anyone believe they know?”

    Silence for several seconds. No one wants to correct an Angel, even indirectly. Finally, one of the younger monks speaks. “S-she didn’t talk about God closing our Souls or the darkness infecting the planet.”

    Ack! You knew that; you just got flustered with having to speak so quickly-
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1175535817817600040 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1175535817817600040><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, November 18, 2023 3:39 PM">3:39 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Good! Of course, it’s difficult to bring all the important facts together in such a short period of time - which is why we do these summaries. As we learned last week, God closed off our Souls when He created the first Angels, in order to prevent further corruption of humanity. However, the darkness then fled from our Souls into the planet itself, where it remains today. Very good, both of you.”

    Brother Trigg slides a new transparency onto the projector, showing a drawing of a shattered landscape. “This is an artist’s impression of Nucarreo during the year zero cataclysm, drawn from the testimony of an Angel who survived it. If you look carefully, you may be able to match up the background mountains and the Endle River to conclude that the original city must have stood <em>here</em> in the image.”

    He swaps it for a closer-up view of that section. Pitiful, fragmented blocks are visible. “Nothing but ruins. All major cities resembled this in year zero, but <em>why?</em> How? Today, we’ll start by going over what evidence remains of the corruption’s last great attack and what the cataclysm is likely to have actually been.”

    You settle into the now-familiar rhythm of class as Trigg displays ancient historical documents and artifacts, correlates them with information from various modern texts (some of which he wrote himself), and encourages you all to summarize and discuss what it all means. It’s a lot of work, especially with all the assigned reading and writing that now occupies much of your evenings, but you’re really enjoying the chance to get actual historical answers to what had previously been the realm of religious myths.

Your Body has continued to change rapidly; the twinges of jealousy you had felt initially at everyone else being so pretty all the time have faded as now you too look good basically no matter the situation. It’s not all looks, either - you’re already faster and stronger than before. The pile of books Brother Cobb had to get someone to carry for you now seems light enough that you were able to bring them back unassisted. (You still struggled, but at least you <em>could!</em>)

    Your Mind hasn’t changed as obviously as your Body, though you have to assume you’re smarter than you were. It seems crazy that you could keep up with a class of highly-educated monks in their late teens to twenties otherwise, and that’s to say nothing of your other courses.

    As for your Soul...

    Well, you were just about to go practice after Trigg’s class, weren’t you?

    <em>Scene 22</em>
    You spot Naoriel on your way over to Illim Hall, as you often do this time of day. Seems she’s got some sort of course in there that finishes at the same time as your course with Brother Trigg, though you have so far been unable to get her to tell you what it is. You give her a wave and she waves back with a smile, but doesn’t slow down to chat.

    You half-frown as you consider her. Naoriel has been fairly amenable to your attempts to befriend her, waving at you as you pass and even occasionally having lunch together. But - just as you were warned by Clarity and the rest of the trainees - you still hardly know her. Well, you know that she likes fizzy drinks and has really pretty handwriting, for example, but you don’t know anything <em>important</em> about her. She just doesn’t talk about herself, pretty much no matter the situation. She has a right to privacy, you suppose, but it’s a little grating for someone as naturally inquisitive as you.

    Oh, that reminds you: at some point you want to bring up the etymology (is that the right -ology?) of her name with her. One of the texts you read for Trigg’s course discussed the original twelve Angels, who all Ascended at once and all took on new names after their transformations. The practice of renaming yourself fell out of favor after a few centuries and now Angels just keep their own names, but in the old days, the -iel and -riel suffixes (is that the right -ffix?) were distinctly popular with newly Ascended Angels. Nowadays, such names are very rare, as they’re still associated with the Angels of old - it’s sort of considered minor blasphemy to name your child like that? It’s like declaring from birth that your child will be an Angel, when obviously you can’t know for sure until their Calling ceremony.

    Anyway, that long-winded reminiscence basically boils down to “names ending in -riel are super rare because they’re considered Angelic, so you’re curious how she got her name.”

It looks like he was actually named Zachary, shortened it in a somewhat unusual way to Zeke, then re-longened it to Ezekiel <em>after</em> he became an Angel. You had to dig through a bunch of legal records for that one, but thankfully Yara, Clarity, <em>and</em> Serri all helped you look (none of them like him either). Honestly, you’re not even sure why you bothered, but at least it’s interesting!

    So, yeah, you’re kind of wondering if Naoriel has a similar story going on. Maybe you should just ask for help sifting through another batch of census documents, but you only have time for so much unimportant research. Seriously, <em>why</em> did you go to all that trouble with Zeke’s name? You almost missed turning in a paper!

    <em>Man</em>, you are distracted today. Good thing you don’t have any more coursework to do until later tonight when you’ve got to read another chapter for Trigg.

    “Serriiiii,” you call, slipping around a hedge into the secluded corner of the Illim Hall gardens the two of you have chosen as your practice spot. It’s surrounded by tall hedges on three sides and only has a somewhat non-obvious entrance on the fourth. There’s a little pond fed by a trickling spout and a few slow, colorful fish to occupy it. They’ve got little whiskers, which you still find adorable. Fish with whiskers! What will God think of next?

    Serri waves from her perch on a smooth, flat rock next to the water. “Fish time.”

    “Fish time!” you echo, hopping onto a rock next to her. You often stare at the fish to help your focus, hence the name. It’s a bad name and you’re both aware of that, but neither of you care.

You’ve progressed to the point where you can - with considerable difficulty - feel your own Soul at will, most of the time. You no longer need a focus like eating or drinking to sense it, though something like that does help you feel any changes to it. Currently, you’re working on reliability and intuition, but you’ll be starting on trying to harness it before too long.

    It’s a little weird to think of your Soul with terminology that describes it as almost separate from you. Having to explicitly focus to even sense it at all, then needing to go out of your way to harness and manipulate it. Switch out the word “Soul” with “liver” or something and it feels even weirder. At least you’re able to assign some words to the sensation now, instead of just the vague “something” from the first few days.

    You suppose, if you had to describe it (and you did, for your instructor), you would say the sensation is sort of like feeling the sun on your skin, except without the physical warmth. More like... the emotional warmth? And it’s backwards, so instead of feeling it from the outside, it’s glowing on the underside of your skin and everything inside you. It’s... weird, but not unpleasant. Like looking really, really close at yourself in a mirror and noticing something nice about your face that’s always been there. Your Soul feels just right, and you’re definitely glad for that.

Her biggest hurdle for months had been that she just couldn’t consistently feel her own Soul, but when the two of you started practicing together, it turned out that she could feel <em>yours</em> a lot more easily. Which kind of freaked you out at first. It surprised her instructor as well, but apparently this sort of thing isn’t entirely unheard of. Some people are extroverts personality-wise, and some (very rare) people are... extroverts Soul-wise? You’re... not entirely sure that metaphor holds up, but the very broadest strokes make sense.

    Somehow, in a way that she struggles to explain and you don’t really understand either, having you around (or any other particularly strong Soul, which basically means an Angel) makes it easier for Serri to sense her own. You don’t even have to do anything; just being around is enough. And, as you might expect, having her reaching out to your Soul as she practices also means you’re starting to get a vague sense of hers as well. You’ve even been able to start broadening your senses to feel other Angels’ Souls if you really, really try, but they do have to be basically touching you. Your instructor says you’ll get better at that over time.

    Anyway, today you’re just working on your own Soul, since you really want to start trying to <em>do</em> things with it. You’re both still glowing, and you’ve only got a little over two months to stop it. You pick your favorite fish - small and silvery, with a stripe of vibrant orange - stare with your physical eyes, and struggle to open your... Soul... eyes. They’re the same eyes, you think. You’re not really sure how sensing different aspects works.

    <em>Scene 23</em>
    You’re still distracted from earlier, thinking about names and history and even your earlier courses. Your arms still hurt a little from sword practice, though not as bad as last week. More benefits to your Body growing stronger, you suppose.

    After a while, you manage to get your Mind under control and settle down to look inwards. It doesn’t take you long today before you have a reasonable awareness of that inner glow to match your outer one; you just try to hold onto it as long as possible. According to your instructor, you’ll need to be able to do this almost unconsciously if you want to be able to use magic in fights - and you do! - since you’ll need that focus to keep a grip on any spells you might have cast.

    Many minutes pass. You feel a neighboring glow a few times and try to sort of “look over,” as it were, but get lost somewhere in the transition. You know that you’ll have to figure that part out as well if you want to do anything that affects the Souls of others around you, including the famous Blessings that Angels can bestow on the city’s population.

    Speaking of which (thinking of which?), you know what a Blessing actually <em>is</em> now. As far as normal citizens are aware, an Angel’s Blessing is essentially a mantle of divine protection, capable of curing various ills as well as providing good luck for a few weeks. No one really knows how Angels can do that, but everyone wants to be Blessed.

    Now you know that it’s a moderately advanced form of Soul magic - advanced external Soul projection to be specific - that basically involves infusing the target’s Soul with some of your own divine energy. The practical benefits are mostly the same as what everyone already knows, but now you’re aware that the good luck actually comes from the target’s Soul becoming able to nudge the world around it in order to better realize the person’s true self. A weak and unconscious version of magic, sort of?

Angels are uniquely able to burn away most forms of the corruption with a touch, and that ability extends to your Soul <em>and</em> the energy it can provide to ordinary people. If someone is in danger of succumbing to the corruption, a Blessing from you can reverse it and protect them for weeks to come. Additionally, there’s a weaker sort of knock-on effect where the energy leaking out of that Blessed person will heal other Souls they come into contact with, forming almost a kind of herd immunity situation if you collectively Bless enough people. It’s not enough to make the city immune to the corruption, but combined with humanity’s innate resistance after God’s change to your Souls, it’s enough to dramatically reduce the number of corruptions in the city. Which is good, because people would panic if they knew there were <em>any</em> outside of extremely rare incursions.

    There’s a lot that the Cathedra keeps from ordinary citizens. Mostly information about just how thin the razor’s edge is (that the city is balanced on), and just how imperfect the Angels are (who maintain that balance).

    (Im)perfection has been a recurring theme in your dreams recently. You don’t want to talk about it. Or think about it, really.

    Thankfully, you’ve now been sitting here for long enough that the evening bell rings and releases you from your thoughts. You stand and stretch. No breakthroughs today, but just a little more progress all the same.

    “Food time,” Serri announces, getting up as well.

    “Food time,” you agree.

    You spent the last few hours speaking exactly four words each, so now you’ve got to make up some of that difference. So it seems, at least. Serri’s really warmed up to you over the last two weeks; she’s much less shy around you and much more likely to chat about anything that’s on her Mind. Or yours, as she’s often curious.

The mist is turning golden with sunset.

    “You too? Did she say anything?”

    “Just a quick hello. She’s always running off whenever I try to talk.”

    “Yeah, I think that’s just how she is.” A beat. “Wait, do you <em>not</em> run into her all the time here? I pass her every other day or so.”

    “N-no, I was early today. Does she have a course here or something?”

    You shrug. “I think so, but she won’t tell me. I figured maybe it was the basic magic one, but Denn told me it isn’t running right now, so I guess she took it last year with him and the third years.”

    Serri cocks her head. “No? You remember when I said there was only one Angel since Yara got here that didn’t take the basic magic course right away? Well, that was Naoriel, actually. I kind of thought she’d be taking it with us.”

    “Huh? But she hasn’t mentioned that at all, and Erich would have said something otherwise, right?”

    “He does have that weird grudge against her...”

    You both stay quiet for a few moments, pondering.

    “She can’t just <em>not</em> take it,” you decide. “I mean, you can’t be a good Angel without <em>some</em> magic.”

    “Maybe she is going to take it with us, but just isn’t saying anything? I mean, she does really like to keep secrets.”

    “Well, yeah, but it’s not like she can hide taking a course from the people who are also taking that same course with her. So what’s the point of being all sneaky about it beforehand?”

    Serri doesn’t know. You don’t either.

    <em>Scene 24</em>
    On your way back to Hearth Hall, you spot a familiar figure emerging from one of the smaller cathedrals nearby. “Be right back,” you tell Serri, then jog over to catch up with Brother Cobb before he can get away.

    “Jessamine?” he says by way of greeting, slowing his pace somewhat. He doesn’t really need to - he may have longer legs, but he’s old and doesn’t move very fast - but it’s the thought that counts.

    “Brother Cobb! I was just doing some Soul training with Serri and I wanted to ask who’s actually going to be in your magic course in June?”

    “Hum? At the moment, only Mr Haskell is signed up. Why do you ask; are you concerned about the two of you getting in?”

    You nod, though that’s mostly a lie if you’re being honest with yourself. You’re already well on track, according to your instructor, and Serri isn’t far behind. Really, you just wanted to know if Naoriel was signed up. She doesn’t glow, so she should have been with Erich (“Mr Haskell”) if she was enrolled.

    Brother Cobb smiles patiently. “I have faith that God will guide both of you in time. I’ve been told you are already making good progress and that Ms Ambrose has begun to show improvement. Persevere and you will succeed.”

    It seems to be kind of a toss-up what mood Brother Cobb is in whenever you talk to him. He can be pretty grouchy, like on your first day with the paperwork and course selection, but he can also be patient and gentle, like right now. You feel a little bad for sort-of-almost lying to him, but not quite bad enough to say anything besides “... Yeah, you’re right. It’s just the timing seems so tight... it’s okay, we’ll make it.”

    “Indeed. Was there anything else? I do need to return to-”

    “Th-that’s it. Thanks; see you in June!”

    You rush off and return to Serri, who looks back curiously as you arrive. “What was that about?”

We were talking about Naoriel taking Cobb’s course, right? So I asked him who’s going to be in it, and she isn’t.”

    Serri frowns thoughtfully. “Well, I really don’t know what she’s doing then. You can’t take any of the advanced magic courses until you’ve taken the basic one. Maybe she’s just not doing any magic at all? But that seems crazy; you’d be missing out on a huge part of being an Angel!”

    “And she doesn’t glow,” you add. “So she must have done at least <em>some</em> Soul training.”

    “Yeah...”

    Well, you learned a little more, but the fact remains that neither of you have any real idea what’s up with Naoriel and she’s not going to tell you. And if you dig too much deeper into this, you’re going to seem obsessed. Maybe you should cool off a little and think about this again later. It’s probably none of your business, anyway.

    The two of you meet up with Yara for dinner, and Etalyn shows up not long after. She’s been hanging around your little group more often since Yara’s latest face-off against her, though you’re of course taking Serri’s word for it that this is a change. She’s still a little intimidating and a little brusque, but you don’t think she actually dislikes you.

    It does make it a little tough to talk to Yara when she shows up, though, since he’s usually distracted trying to impress her with some new trick or another. She usually rolls her eyes or otherwise doesn’t seem impressed, but she does keep coming back. You’re pretty sure at this point that they actually are friends, though neither of them seem willing to actually <em>admit</em> that - Etalyn says he’s too ridiculous, while Yara says she’s too cool.

    Well, whatever. You and Serri agree on this one.

It’s usually interesting enough that you don’t have any issue finishing on time, and today isn’t any different: it’s all about the great year-zero cataclysm. There aren’t many surviving physical records from the time, but some Angels did survive the disaster and passed on their memories of the event to scribes later. You assume some regular people also survived, but civilization wasn’t in any condition to properly take care of written records until well after any mortal survivors would have died of old age.

    Unfortunately, these Angels’ testimonies are all contradictory. Some describe an overwhelming army of darkness assaulting every major city at once, while others recall a single blast of corrupting force, and still others claim the very earth rose up against humanity. It’s unclear whether these differences were present in the original testimonies or if they were introduced later, and modern historians can’t just go ask these Angels to check; they all died fighting the corruption before year 200.

    You pause there, thinking again about your own lifespan. Immortality. You will not die of old age or disease, but you will still die. No Angel has avoided death forever; the oldest on record lived over six centuries before perishing to their own magic in a catastrophic backfire.

    Your immortality will extend your life, but it also guarantees that it will end in violence. Passing away peacefully in your sleep is not an option; you will die on the battlefield. Whether that be to a darkness creature’s claws, a Shade’s blade, or your own magic, you don’t know. Just that it will happen someday, unless the corruption is purified and the world made safe.

Maybe it’ll really start to sink in once you stop aging, when you can look in the mirror one day and a decade later and see the exact same face looking back. Maybe it’ll suddenly make sense when you first leave the city and come face to face with the darkness in the wastes. Maybe you’ll never understand until you lie bleeding out on the packed-hard wasteland dirt, begging for God to save you.

    ... You get up and pace around your room. That last image is a little too morbid for you; where did that come from?

    After a minute’s break, you successfully stop thinking about it, shoving the thoughts about your immortality into the same mental compartment as the ones about perfection, fighting for real, and other hefty worries. You’ll get around to figuring them out in a more productive manner later. For now, you gotta learn your history.

    <em>Scene 25</em>
    It’s now late April. The mist is growing thinner as spring trundles on towards summer. Temperatures are getting warmer and many Angels are going around with their outer coats partially unbuttoned. You have been training at the Cathedra for almost two months.

    Naoriel still remains a mystery; you haven’t made much progress since mid-March. You did end up asking her about the basic magic course during lunch one day - and she did admit that she wasn’t planning on taking it in June - but she stopped short of explaining what she was going to do instead. You pushed a little, but all she did was produce a little shower of glittery sparks from her finger and say she’d be fine. So clearly she’d already had <em>some</em> training from somewhere, but you don’t know where or why. Well, whatever; you’ve got plenty of your own work to focus on.

    You’ve made some real progress on your glow in the past month; you’re now able to suppress it entirely for several minutes at a time before the strain gets to be too much and you have to release it again. Your instructor says you should be able to get permanent control in another few weeks as long as you practice, so you’ve regularly been doing just that, flickering on and off like a broken lightbulb whenever you have the strength.

    It turns out that imposing control over your glow actually works similarly to real magic - it’s all just directing your Soul in various ways - so working on suppressing it like this is exercising your magic-casting “muscles.” That means you’ve regularly been suffering from the scarily-named “Soul fatigue” as you constantly overdo it in your impatience. It’s not as bad as it sounds, though; you just struggle to feel emotions and motivation until your Soul recovers some energy. There’s no serious concern for your health; you’re not practiced enough to drain your Soul to the point of doing real damage.

There’s also a huge sense of accomplishment as you can literally measure your Soul growing stronger every day: how long you can keep the glow off. It’s even starting to seem a little more natural to not be glowing, and according to your instructor, it’ll eventually be effortless either way. The strain right now is because you’re “molding” your Soul to your Body, but once it fits properly, you’ll be able to switch back and forth with no stress.

    Serri is having more trouble than you - she can only manage a few seconds - but she <em>can</em> turn off her glow now! Brother Cobb has provisionally added you both to his course, though he cautions that you should still work hard to get to that effortless stage before June. You don’t want to have to expend focus and energy on both your Soul <em>and</em> the magic you’re trying to cast.

    So, what does all this have to do with the imposing metal door you’re standing in front of, brightening your glow to read the number on it? Well... it’s the wrong door anyway, so not much. But the <em>right</em> door...

    “Say, Jessamine,” Yara had asked a few days ago as you were working together on a pretty hefty assignment for Brother Trigg. “You’re making exemplary progress on your Soul control and, if I recall, you’re quite interested in magic.”

    “... Yes?”

    “Well, I have a major practical coming up for my Soul course and I really could use an assistant to help with the experiment. It’s nothing difficult; I just don’t have enough hands for all the equipment. I don’t suppose you’d be willing to assist?”

    Of course you were willing; he’d been helping with your assignment at that very moment anyway. But after some more explanation as to what the experiment actually <em>did</em>, you started to wonder if it was actually sanctioned by his instructor. The plan seemed a little... ambitious.

The basement of Illim Hall is a labyrinth of strange metal hallways, most either dimly lit with mechanical lamps on their lowest setting or completely dark due to the sensitivity of the experiments. Apparently light is a major component in many Soul-related mechanisms, which makes its control a high priority. It sure makes the place extremely creepy, though, as you nervously walk down long, quiet corridors in near-darkness. At least this proves another use for your glow.

    B...46. This is the right door. You knock and hear a muffled “come in,” so you do. Thankfully, the room itself is well-lit and Yara quickly emerges from a tangle of complicated-looking prisms and mirrors suspended by metal rods. “Jessamine, welcome to my lair!” He cackles for a moment, then leans down in a quieter voice. “Or rather, my lab. The Cathedra’s lab, really. Which I am using. Is this your first time down here?”

    “Y-yes. It’s... very dark.”

    “Ah ha! Imagine coming down here late at night to check on a long-running experiment. Total silence; no one around; utter darkness. They turn off even the dim lights at night, you know. Once heard someone else opening a door at two in the morning and just about ran right back out.”

    You shiver, imagining it as requested.

    “At least, I assume it was someone else and not a ghost. <em>Anyway</em>, I’m just about ready to get started here, so let me explain what this is supposed to do.”

There’s a simple wooden stool sitting in the middle of a chalk-drawn circle decorated with many geometric symbols, including the matan in several configurations. Nearby is an odd box again covered in symbols, with a protrusion facing the chair and several openings on the opposite side. The assembly of prisms and mirrors is close behind the box, and you note a number of flexible-armed mechanical lamps carefully arranged just behind that.

    “This apparatus is designed to visibly reveal Souls!” Yara states theatrically, waving his hand at the mess. “Worry not about the details - for if you understood them already, I would feel terribly incompetent - but the basic idea is that light comes in here-” He points at the mechanical lamps. “-passes through here-” A gesture to the prisms, mirrors, and box. “-and reveals the Soul of the target on the chair, there.”

    “I didn’t know you could do... magic(?) with <em>things</em> like this.”

    “Well, the mechanisms don’t provide any of the actual Soul energy; they merely focus it in a way that’s precise enough to be near-impossible to do manually. Almost every portion of this apparatus has been infused by me in some way or another to alter its properties, so please be <em>very</em> careful not to touch anything.”

    Thankfully, you already had been.

    <em>Scene 26</em>
    “Anyway, enough about that,” he declares, leading you around to a small selection of levers haphazardly connected to the box and the lights. “I’d like you to operate the controls, if you please. Simply flip each lever to ‘on,’ in order, when I tell you! Easy!”

    You glance over at the chair. “Then, you’re going to be...”

    “The test subject, of course! There’s no better way to prove your faith in a procedure than to use it on yourself. Besides, there’s no way I would consider putting someone else in that chair before I’ve proven it 100% safe.”

    “S-so you’re not, er 100% sure that-”

    “Nothing is ever certain!” He gets a little more serious for a moment. “Really, it’s not going to do anything bad. The energy levels in play are simply too low to hurt me, even if something were to malfunction catastrophically. And if I ever seem in distress, you can pull the lever marked with the X there and shut everything down. Good?”

    “... Good.”

    “Excellent. Now, you’ll be moving from left to right on the board; just let me get into position here and we’ll get started shortly.”

    Yara picks his way through the mess towards the chair and settles onto it, flipping open a different box on the way there. You hesitate. “Er, Yara, this isn’t... S-Soul transmutation, is it?”

    He glances up at you. “Hm? Well, to a certain extent...”

    “I-isn’t that <em>super</em> not allowed?”

    “Oh! No, no no no. I see the problem; you’ve been talking to Etalyn too much! Or Brother Cobb; he’s just as bad.”

    “...” You haven’t, really. At least, not any more than normal.

    “Okay, I understand that Soul transmutation is a <em>bit</em> of a sensitive subject around here, but really it’s only <em>internal</em> Soul transmutation that’s entirely banned. <em>External</em> Soul transmutation, like what I’ve got here, is only <em>mostly</em> banned.”

    “I-I’m not reassured...”

Extracting, splicing, transferring, and - worst of all - trying to manipulate a Soul’s connection to God. But plenty of experienced Angels use external Soul transmutation semi-frequently; it’s the only way to perform the most delicate mending of corrupted Souls where simple projection is too blunt.”

    “S-so what you’re doing here is... like mending?”

    “Not exactly, but it’s certainly not going to harm anyone! It’s hardly even transmutation, really; it just reveals what is already present. Besides, I even got the proper permission this time, so no one can complain. I wouldn’t go to all this trouble of setting up and performing a complicated experiment for an instructor to whom I couldn’t then show it! Do I seem insane enough to turn in forbidden magic for grading?”

    “Well, no...” He makes some good points; you’re starting to calm down. If it’s sanctioned by an instructor, of course it’s okay.

    “Then, ready for those levers?”

    “... Okay.”

    “Excellent! Let me get my pen... Alright, suppress your glow and pull lever one, please.”

    “G-glow? Oh, right.” That makes sense; having your Soul light up the experiment to see Souls might interfere a bit. It takes you some time, but you eventually get it turned off (for a few minutes, at least). Now, lever one. You grasp it, glance up at Yara one more time, then carefully pull it down. Two of the lamps turn on and the box begins to hum. Nothing else seems to happen.

    “Hmm, mm hm...” Yara peers towards the other box he previously flipped open, then scribbles something down and nods. “Lever two, please.”

Two more lamps turn on and the box’s hum lowers in pitch. You start to feel a little uncomfortable, as if your bones are rattling, but it’s not any worse than standing near the train tracks when a heavy locomotive is rushing by. Yara appears to be glittering now; he looks at the back of his hand curiously. Another check with the open box, another scribble. Actually, the air between him and the light box seems to be glittering too; it’s not just his Body.

    “Lever three, please.”

    “...” Lever three it is. The last three lamps turn on and the box’s hum drops in pitch again to the point where you can’t hear it anymore. You feel an uncomfortable pressure on your eardrums, but it lightens up when you swallow. “... Yara?”

    “It’s fine; it’s fine.” The glittering hasn’t changed, but as he quickly notes down some more observations, you can tell he’s not completely comfortable either. His brow is a little furrowed; he’s moving with a little bit of strain. You eye the “X” lever, but don’t touch it yet. “Fourth lever, please.”

    That’s the last one. You pull it. No more lamps light, but two of them change color subtly enough that, on second thought, you’re not entirely sure they actually changed. The box clanks softly, then returns to a loud silence. You dry-swallow several times to relieve the pressure on your ears. Yara... doesn’t look any different, really. The glittering has faded somewhat and you can’t see anything that’s obviously his Soul.

    He checks the side box one more time, writes down a few more things, then shakes his head. “Darn. I don’t suppose you see anything? No? Alright, shut it down, if you would.”

    You’re fairly relieved to pull the “X” lever, watching the lamps shut off and the box’s sound climb back up into audible range before slowing to a truly silent stop. No more bone rattling or pressure spikes; everything’s back to normal.

    “Jessamine, I do apologize for that resonance. You aren’t injured, right?”

    “Fine, fine. I believe the introduction of a test subject in the path of the beam must have caused some reflection... Perhaps I should design a shield of some sort. But, I suppose that hardly matters as it, well, did not work. To put it bluntly.”

    The strain is getting too much. “Yara, I have to start glowing again. Is that safe in here?”

    “Yes; all the equipment is turned off. I just need to note down a few more things before I forget...”

    You release the glow. Then, you pause. “Er... Y-Yara?”

    “Hm? What-” He stops. “W-what?”

    Your glow isn’t white anymore; it’s gold. Glimmering, lustrous golden light pours from your Body and competes with the sterile ceiling lamps to illuminate the room. You don’t <em>feel</em> any different, but... “Yara, w-what does this mean?”

    “Er- I don’t... Hang on.” He focuses and begins to glow as well, with light as similarly golden as yours. “What on earth? Soul light isn’t golden; what...?”

    <em>“Yara?”</em>

    “I’m thinking; hang on!” He closes his eyes; his glow dims. You know he’s examining the situation from within, searching for a cause or a solution by “looking” at your Souls directly instead of the physical light they’re giving off, but it’s still hard to accept that he’s not just standing there doing nothing.

    ... You could try the same. There’s nothing else for you to do, so you give it a shot, gazing inwards to see if you can discover what happened to your Soul.

    Confusion. A mess of swirling golden and silver. Instability; <em>you’re</em> unstable. Something isn’t in the right state. What? You? It’s hard to tell anything in the-

    You jolt, feeling a slight chill. When you open your eyes again, your glow is back to normal. Yara’s fades back to ordinary white as well, less than ten seconds later. He opens his eyes.

    <em>Scene 27</em>
    ...

    Yara didn’t want to tell anyone what happened. The experiment might have been approved, he said, but the results certainly weren’t. Things could get out of hand. Inquisitors were mentioned. But, eventually, you convince him. You’re worried about what happened to your Souls. Turning them gold? What does that even mean? You could be corrupted or damaged or have some horrible illness that could grow worse over time and end up harming not only yourselves, but anyone nearby. What if it’s contagious? You could infect the whole Cathedra before anyone catches it!

    So he agreed to explain what happened, but not to just anyone. Only to his instructor. Unfortunately, his instructor isn’t an Angel and thus can’t mend Souls. Someone else had to be called. And that’s why you’re now sitting here in a cold, sterile examination room in Illim Hall, all alone and waiting for someone to show up and tell you if you’ll be okay.

    A knock on the door. You’re not prepared, but you say “come in” anyway. You feel like you’re six years old again, back in that hospital as your breath caught and your lungs ached. What will be wrong with you this time?

    A female Angel enters, wearing the same white uniform as everyone else. Ghostly pale hair that seems to drift as if it’s lighter than it should be. A pair of glorious, beautiful white wings folded tightly against her back. An Archangel.

    “Good afternoon, Jessamine. My name is Aveline; I’m just here to make sure you aren’t hurt. How are you feeling?”

    “...” You have to say something. “Fine.”

    She smiles gently, like she understands. “Yara is fine, by the way. No sign of any Soul instability. I’m sure you’ll be no different.”

    Well, that’s good, at least. You breathe out, relaxing just a little. “Okay.”

    “If you can please just sit still and clear your Mind, I’ll get started. If it helps, you can focus on something monotonous, like counting.”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1179968005061480538 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1179968005061480538><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, November 30, 2023 9:11 PM">9:11 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“... Okay.” You have no hope of trying to keep your Mind clear just by thinking about it, so you take her advice and start counting up at a steady rate. After a dozen numbers, you realize you’ve unconsciously synchronized each number with a beat of your heart. It’s a little fast.

    Aveline takes a deep breath and releases it measuredly. Then, you feel a presence. It’s somewhat like when Serri touches your Soul during your training together, but the touch is both lighter and more deliberate. You feel a sense of closeness to this Angel you’ve never met before; not necessarily a sense of <em>friendliness</em> or any sort of emotional relationship, but just a sense that you <em>know</em> her. Even though you, well, don’t. Still, the sensation calms you somewhat even though you know it’s not real. Someone you know like this couldn’t possibly do anything bad to you.

    Sunlight. Warmth from every angle. You could be outside and the fog burnt away for how warm you feel. It’s - you jolt, shivering with a sudden icy chill. It disturbs you so much that you lose track of your count and physically recoil. “Wh-what was that?”

    The Archangel steps back as well. “Hm. Don’t be worried; it’s nothing major.”

    You’re worried. And, despite the very trying day you’ve had (perhaps <em>because</em> of it) you’re driven to ask again. “What <em>was</em> that?!”

    She seems to grasp that you’re not going to be reassured by empty platitudes. “There is a small twist in your Soul - like a little knot - that could, if left alone, start to develop into corruption.”

    “...”

    “I can’t say for sure it was caused by today’s events, but if I had to guess...”

    You stare at her. She has to guess. You’ll demand it if she doesn’t.

    “It does seem very recent. You’ve been training very hard lately, haven’t you?”

    “My... glow. I’m - I have to suppress it before June...”

I believe your Soul may have simply been fatigued enough that, when hit by that energy today, it twisted <em>just</em> a little.”

    “But Y-Yara... he’s <em>definitely</em> okay? Nothing like this?”

    “Promise. He’s not training as hard as you, it seems.”

    “... C-can you fix it?”

    “Oh, of course! It’s no issue at all. I’m one of the most proficient Soul channelers alive; I’ve reconstructed Souls burned down to almost nothing. You’re in good hands, I promise.”

    You can only nod.

    “Okay, let’s get you all better, shall we? Can you go ahead and lie down for me? Just in case you get a little light-headed; don’t want you falling down.”

    Your anxiety rises. You really do feel like you’re back at the doctor’s. Despite yourself, you have to voice that one question that every doctor always lies about. Just in case, maybe, she’ll tell the truth. “Will, uh, will this hurt?”

    Aveline looks you in the eyes. “No, not at all. You won’t feel a thing; promise.”

    “...”

    You wake up a minute later, confused but - as promised - not in any pain. “Wh-wha...?”

    “Calm, calm. Don’t move for a minute, please. You’re all done; you did very well.”

    “It’s... fixed?”

    “You’re all better. Just please slow down a little on your training. Your dedication is very admirable, but exhausting your Soul every day will take its toll.”

    “But... the deadline...”

    “Brother Cobb will understand, I’m sure. I’ll put in a word with him personally, okay?”

    “Okay...”

    After a few more minutes of recovery, you’re feeling good enough to leave. Aveline leads you out to a sitting room where Yara is waiting, then waves farewell and returns into the depths of the hall.

    “Jessamine! Goodness, that took much longer than I expected. You’re looking... slumpy? Was there - oh dear, was there a problem?”

    He chuckles halfheartedly. “You could say that.”

    That night, you nearly drop your toothbrush when you remember exactly who the Archangel had promised to talk to. You had been disoriented and confused, and agreed out of reflex. Brother Cobb. Oh, <em>no.</em>

    By the next morning, Yara’s instructor has been fired, removed from the campus without a trace. Yara’s lab and equipment has been confiscated. His course unceremoniously terminated. And - he finds you at lunch to catch up - a very stern bishop sat him down and frankly informed him that he was to stop all investigations into Soul transmutation immediately, or else. Not a request. Hardly even a demand. A threat. “Until you possess the required experience,” the bishop had said. “We may revisit this decision in a decade or so.”

    “Well,” he concludes, putting a brave face on it. “As you said, at least no one got hurt.”

    “Not... physically, at least. Your instructor...”

    “Yes... that does, admittedly, upset me a tad.” He’s drumming his fingers on the table, distracted. “Sister Bagley apparently ‘did not have the authority to approve such experiments,’ so said the bishop. And apparently that’s enough to expel her immediately, from this organization she served her whole life. The woman is in her seventies, Jessamine; what is she going to do in the city? Learn a new trade?”

    “Er-”

    “Honestly.” He sighs, but his fingers keep drumming. “I’m sorry; I need to think. I’ll... talk to you later.”

    “Yara-”

    Too late.

    <em>Scene 28</em>
    By evening bell, rumors about the incident have become widespread. No one seems sure about the full details, but Sister Bagley’s firing isn’t exactly something that can be kept quiet. People are whispering about you behind your back; you just know it.

    So it probably shouldn’t surprise you (even though it sort of does) when Clarity shows up to eat dinner with you. Serri’s here too, as usual, but Yara is conspicuously absent.

    “Jess, my goodness! You and poor Yara have had quite a day, I hear.”

    “You could... say that.”

    “Please, let me know what happened and what I can do to help! I’ve only heard some rumors here and there, but they’re saying that Yara was delving into forbidden magic!” She wiggles her fingers in a way that you would have once considered insensitive, but have since come to understand is just how Clarity operates. Too much energy, all the time. “I can’t imagine he would be so brazen, though.”

    “I... don’t know if I want to talk about it.” You’ve been distracted all day, thinking about what other people think of you - and you still have courses, too! There hasn’t been time to work out exactly what <em>you</em> think about what happened.

    “My, I understand. But there isn’t much time if you want to offset some of this nasty gossip. Without the true details, people are assuming the worst. I’ve been doing what I can, but it’s difficult without proper information. Please, just let me help.”

    “...”

    “I’d... like to know too,” Serri says quietly. “Yara’s been really upset today and I don’t know how to help him. And you too, Jess.”

You can’t say no to those sad eyes. Hesitantly, quietly, keenly aware of the other Angels nearby, you tell them. Maybe not everything, but enough to paint a clear picture of how Sister Bagley and Yara aren’t at fault. At least, in your opinion - clearly not one that the Cathedra shares. Of course, you’re aware that anything you say to Clarity has a very good chance of making its way into the campus rumor mill, but she’s at least partially right: the existing talk is worse than the truth in a lot of cases. Maybe getting it out there is a good idea.

    “My, my, thank you for sharing. It certainly seems like an overreaction from the higher-ups; I do wonder what they might be hiding... But, anyway, I’ll get to work trying to clean up the record. And I do believe I’ve already come up with a lovely idea to get Yara back on his feet.”

    “Really? What is it?”

    Clarity puts a finger to her lips. “That would be telling! But, just to be safe, do you have anything planned for Day of the Wall?”

    “Huh?” The Day of the Wall: you’d forgotten about it entirely in all the confusion, but it’s coming up soon, isn’t it? Next week? It’s a holiday held on the seventh of May every year to honor the ordinary humans who built the city’s defenses while Angels were out fighting the darkness in the wastes. Ostensibly the date was chosen to represent the day the first brick was laid in Nucarreo’s city-wide wall, but given your recent reading, you now know there aren’t any surviving records from the time to be sure. Besides, the seventh is always Friday and most people get the holiday off work, providing another secular reason to have it then. “N-no; I had almost forgotten it was coming up.”

    “Hm! Excellent; don’t schedule anything. You’re being recruited.”

    “Recruited for what?”

    “That would be <em>telling</em>~~~!”

    “Nope! I just gotta do some exploring first to make sure. I’ll tell you later.”

    Clarity’s gotten too excited now, and she runs off after finishing her food. You and Serri remain behind because you’re eating at a normal pace instead.

    “So... do you think I’m going to regret that in a week?”

    Serri considers it. “... No, I don’t think so. She’s a little crazy, but we all are in some way or another. And she always means well.”

    “I hope so.”

    “Er, do you think Yara’s going to... stop... Soul transmutation?”

    “...”

    “I’m just worried that after what the bishop said - but he’s so dedicated and really stubborn about magic...”

    “Serri, why is Yara so obsessed with Soul transmutation? It’s almost the <em>only</em> thing we aren’t allowed to do with magic, and he just decided to focus on it?”

    “He...” A pause. “I never got a straight answer, really. But it’s the least-explored branch of magic by a lot <em>because</em> it’s been mostly forbidden for so long, and Yara really likes discovering new things.”

    “Is that enough to go against a bishop, though?”

    “No! But I’m worried that he’s going to think it is!”

    “... It does seem like something he might do.”

    “Right? But I don’t know what to say to stop him. He’s so agreeable; he’d probably just say ‘okay, I’ll stop’ and then just go do something dumb anyway.”

    “That... does seem like something he might do,” you repeat.

    “‘Sup, girls. Where’s the idiot?”

    Both of you turn quickly to notice Etalyn standing behind you, clearly very ticked off. For some reason, you think she’s dressed differently from normal, but in the half-second you have, you can’t figure out how.

    “Y-you mean, er, Yara?”

    “And I haven’t seen him since lunch,” you add.

    “Great. He’s sulking or he’s doing something stupid. Come on, we’re gonna go find him.”

    <em>Scene 29</em>
    In brief, you go with her, hastily finishing your dinner and hurrying off... well, upstairs first. Just in case he’s in his room; that’d save you a lot of trouble.

    You’ve got five flights of stairs to say something to Etalyn before she shows up at his door all shouty, but before that, you need to figure out why she looks different; it’s really distracting-

    “I like your necklace, by the way,” Serri says. <em>That’s</em> it: she’s wearing a little silver necklace with a tiny yellow gemstone. That’s why it’s throwing you off, because- “You don’t wear jewelry very often; it looks good on you. Where’d you get it?”

    For some reason, she seems annoyed by the question. Well, maybe not the question, but the answer? “... Yara gave it to me. Should have known what he was up to when he talked about gemstones for twenty minutes.”

    “Y-Yara? Like, just out of the blue?” Serri glances meaningfully back at you; it seems your understanding of their relationship might need revision.

    Etalyn seems even more annoyed (embarrassed?) by this one, folding her arms huffily in a way that is a lot more impressive when done while climbing up several flights of stairs. “No, for my birthday.”

    “Your birthday?!” Serri exclaims at the same time as you ask “When?”

    “... Last week sometime. I try not to make a big deal about it; not even sure how he found out. Even the older trainees should only know the month, not the day.”

    “...” You and Serri look at each other again. You’ll need to chat about this later.

    In any case, Etalyn seems to be a little less mad by the time you finally get to the fifth floor, though whether that’s due to the conversation or the exercise is unknown. She knocks on the door, but - predictably, you guess - there’s no answer. Either he’s not there or he’s not interested in talking, and none of you (even Etalyn!) are going to break into his room. At least, not yet. Instead, you head out into the fog.

The library in Oth Hall? Nope, and you were pretty thorough. His classroom or instructor’s office in the same building, since you’re here already? Nope, and the monk hasn’t seen him since the early afternoon either. A certain secluded garden area near Forger Hall? Nope, just a few round birds.

    Eventually, you decide to return to Illim Hall and, at Etalyn’s suggestion, the basement. Yara was right about the lights; it’s hardly evening but almost all of them are already off. Strange noises echo from various labs, though most of them are simply quiet. You’re more than a little unsettled, but at least you’re not taking it as bad as Serri, who’s clinging to you and flaring her glow to try and illuminate the corridor. Etalyn, of course, seems unaffected by the creepy atmosphere.

    “You don’t think he’d really be in the same lab, do you?” you whisper to Etalyn. “No one’s allowed in until they-”

    She partially rounds a corner, stops, then calmly gestures for you to look as well. When you do, you can clearly see he isn’t in the lab, because the door is open. Two Angels and a monk quietly discuss something while two younger workers kneel to inspect the door and corridor just outside with strange mechanical devices. “No, not really. But it was worth a look.”

    The three of you head back upstairs, check Sister Bagley’s office just for good measure (empty, locked, and Yara-less), then take a break to think. You’ve been searching for long enough that the sun has set and night is encroaching on the fog. It’s entirely possible you just missed him and he’s already back at Hearth Hall, reading or practicing magic or even looking for you all as well. You’re starting to feel both a little silly and just a little worried; maybe he really <em>did</em> do something dumb.

    “When are we going to give up?” Serri asks. “I don’t think we’re going to find him and I’ve got stuff to do before tomorrow!”

    Serri hesitates. You try to convince Etalyn. “He might be back at Hearth Hall by now, anyway. It’s pretty late; it’d be more weird if he isn’t.”

    “Go ahead.”

    “Are... you going to come back, too?”

    “Not yet.”

    <em>Scene 30</em>
    “I’ll stay.”

    “What? Jess, what about your homework?”

    “It’s not that much,” you half-lie. “I can get it done pretty quick.”

    “...”

    “You can go back, though. <em>Someone</em> probably should, anyway, in case he’s already there just waiting for us.”

    “Mrgh...” Serri grumbles at you, but does go back. “If you’re still out here by night bell, I’ll be really mad!”

    Etalyn doesn’t seem to care one way or the other that you’ve stayed. “Well, I’m going to check the Center.”

    You hurry to catch up with her, your glow mixing with the evening fog to create a shimmery wall of mist that makes it really hard to see where you’re going. It’s always like this after dark; the fog grows thicker and most lights just make things worse. Maybe you should try to suppress it again.

    “Hey, uh, why are you... doing all this for Yara?”

    Etalyn glances over her shoulder and you nearly stumble in sudden fright, but she doesn’t do anything. “I told you, he’s either sulking or doing something stupid. Stupid’s bad, so here I am.”

    “Er...” That’s not exactly what you meant. “But you’re always, um...” How can you ask without actually saying it? She’d get mad for sure if you did! “It doesn’t seem like you like him very much.”

    “Hmph. You’re right; he’s absurd and makes bad decisions. And has no regard for his own safety.”

    “So, why...?”

    “Look, are you going to interrogate me all night or are you going to actually help?”

    “S-sorry!”

    In the end, you don’t find Yara. The two of you search through most of campus - barring places you aren’t allowed into, like the Lordstone Cathedral - but find nothing of use. No Yara, no hints as to where he went, and no one who’s seen him since midafternoon. And as the night bell begins to chime, indicating that you are now <em>very</em> behind on your homework, you start to get really concerned.

    “D-do you think maybe he didn’t do anything stupid, but something... happened to him?”

    “...”

    “Etalyn...?”

    “Ridiculous,” she declares.

    “The grounds are totally safe and Yara’s an Angel. The only thing that could ‘happen’ to him is getting another talking-to from a bishop.”

    “Th-that’s what I’m worried about...”

    “Ridiculous,” she repeats. “They just did that. He’s not getting another unless he does something stupid.”

    “That’s what, er, <em>you</em> were worried about...”

    “...”

    “What do we do?”

    “We’re going back.”

    “T-to Hearth Hall?”

    “Yeah. Your buddy’s gonna be mad since you’re late.”

    “But-”

    “Plus,” Etalyn sighs. “We’re not gonna find him just wandering around in the dark. We’ve already looked everywhere. It’s time to call it quits and, if he’s not back in the morning, go raise hell with someone.”

    Decision made, she pivots and begins to quickly head the other direction. You scramble to catch up before she vanishes into the mist. Objectively, she’s probably right; you really don’t have a chance of finding him at this point. The Cathedra is just too big and it’s too hard to see anything. But... it <em>really</em> doesn’t feel good leaving the question open. Where <em>is</em> he? What happened? Why? What in the world are you going to do if he’s not-

    “THERE YOU ARE!!”

    “Ah, <em>welcome</em> back to - ack!”

    You stand in the doorway, baffled, as Yara (completely unharmed and standing up from his favorite chair in the common area) is nearly knocked over by Etalyn rushing over to smack him.

    “WHERE! THE HELL! WERE YOU?!”

    “Careful - ow - Ets, come on -”

    “S-Serri?” you ask, finding her sitting nearby.

    “Sorry,” she says. “He was here when I got back. Apparently he just stayed late at Forger Hall, then went to the library?”

    “The... the opposite order that we...?”

    She grimaces in sympathy. “We must have just missed him. We tried going back out to find you two, but you must have already left and we didn’t think you’d stay out so late!”

    You collapse into a chair. Whoops. Well, at least you can stop worrying now; Yara’s totally fine. Or at least, he was until Etalyn got - woah, was that a hug or some sort of hold?

    Etalyn isn’t letting him off the hook that easily. “It does after what happened yesterday! Thought you’d been arrested for more banned magic or something!”

    “No, though of course Sister Bagely wasn’t as fortunate as me.”

    “Listen, Yara. You and Soul transmutation. <em>Done.</em> Got it?”

    “Pff. What are you, a bishop - ack!”

    She leans in closer. “DONE.”

    “Ets, come on; you can’t assume I would-”

    “You know what happens to Angels who break this sort of rule? <em>Twice?”</em>

    “Showered with praise and have a building named after them?”

    “They DIE.”

    “Now, now, surely you’re exaggerating. The experiments aren’t <em>that</em> dangerous. Though admittedly, poor Jessamine was-”

    “Not that! <em>Executed</em>, idiot.”

    “Ah.” A pause. “No, that can’t be right; no Angel has been executed since, erm, Jessamine, help me out here, when was it?”

    You jolt, obediently trying to remember, but are saved from your ignorance by another outburst from Etalyn. “What are you, thick?! Turn off the jokes for a <em>second!</em> Have you <em>heard</em> what Brother Cobb says about Soul Transmutation? Have you <em>talked</em> to any of the Archangels about it? A bishop? Come <em>ON</em>, Yara, value your own life for once!”

    “...”

    “We... we don’t want you to get hurt,” you add quietly. Lamely. You can hardly hear yourself after Etalyn’s shouting. Serri nods in agreement, but doesn’t have anything to add. You don’t blame her; you barely did either.

    “Ah...” He wipes his eyes; takes a deep breath. “I... I still need to pursue Soul transmutation.”

    <em>“What?!”</em>

I suppose, for you, I can slow down. I have - in theory - forever, anyway.”

    A silence. None of you want to follow that up.

    “Well?” he asks, returning somewhat to his usual persona. “No one has a response? A comical follow-up where you ask if ‘slowing down’ means ‘stopping,’ and I hem and haw and refuse to provide a straight answer?”

    “Yara.” That’s Etalyn again.

    “Yes?”

    “Stop Soul transmuting.”

    “Oh, very well. If you insist. But I fully intend to revisit this once I have the ‘required experience’ that bishop wants.”

    “Fine. Till then, be good. Soul <em>projection</em> only, if you’re doing anything Soul-related.”

    “Yes, yes. Perhaps I’ll take some time to focus on physical transmutation again; I still have a match to win against a certain sword-prodigy Angel.”

    Finally, for the first time today, Etalyn smiles. “Bring it on.”

    You exhale in relief, the tension seemingly passed. He’ll be okay.

    !

    But you sure won’t unless you get to work on that reading! It’s already super late; oh <em>noooo-</em>

    [About a week later...]
    [Clarity has invited you, Yara, and one other Angel for “something special” on the Day of the Wall. She... keeps giggling about this. Who’s the fourth?]

    <em>Scene 31</em>
    You do a little spin, looking at yourself in the mirror. It’s now the morning of the Day of the Wall, and Clarity has invited you to a mysterious “something special” today, along with Yara and Denn (of all people). It’s not that you dislike Denn; it’s just that you haven’t really talked to him outside of a few times here and there. You don’t know much about him except that he’s laid back and he hangs out with Erich a lot. At least Clarity didn’t invite <em>him.</em>

    Anyway, the reason you’re so concerned about your appearance this morning is that you’re not wearing your Angel uniform today. Clarity gave you an outfit yesterday, saying it was a gift for you and to wear it tomorrow because “you don’t want to stand out.” You’re not sure how wearing something different from every other Angel will help you blend in, but whatever. It’s a fashionable blue dress with a light yellow jacket, apparently picked to match your eyes and hair respectively. She even included boots and a ribbon for your hair; how much did all of this cost? You don’t get paid to be an Angel (at least, not until you graduate), so where did she get the money?

    Well, whatever. You look pretty, you think, so that’s probably good enough even though you didn’t get the ribbon on quite right. Having a consistently flawless appearance just due to the nature of your Body has done wonders for your self-image.

    “Good morning, Miss Fashionable,” Yara greets you as you come down the stairs to the common area. He and Clarity are already there, but Denn isn’t yet. At least you’re not late.

    “Woah. It’s weird to see everyone so... colorful.” The two of them are out of uniform as well; Clarity has a green dress of similar style to yours, but with a white-and-red knit cardigan instead of a jacket. Yara isn’t in a dress (though honestly, you wouldn’t put it past him), but has on grey-black striped trousers and a fancy red overcoat. “But... are you sure we aren’t going to stand out?”

    Yara faux-sighs. “Honestly, Jessamine, someone has got to knock some sense into this girl one of these days. Would you believe she hasn’t told me what we’re doing either?”

    “Er, yes.”

    “Well, good, because she hasn’t. Anyway, we will likely stand out a bit, but it’s certainly better than wearing our proper uniforms. This way, we’ll probably just look like rich kids instead of rich Angels.”

    “Wait, we’re... hiding that we’re Angels? Everyone knows that here.”

    He glances at Clarity quizzically. “Did you honestly not even tell her we’re leaving the Cathedra today?”

    “Hehe!”

    “Wh-what?! I didn’t - we can just <em>leave?</em> Just like that?”

    “Well, not every day. Holidays are special because trainees can leave without an escort so long as they’re capable of disguising themselves. That means no official uniforms and, crucially-”

    Clarity finishes his sentence for him. “No Angelic beauty, I’m afraid.”

    You look over at her and almost jump in shock. She’s still pretty, sure, but just <em>regular</em> pretty instead of the radiant appearance you’ve grown used to over the months. There’s a brief shimmer from Yara and, when you turn to him, he looks like a normal human being as well. Either of them could now, as he said, pass for rich children of politicians or business owners as opposed to divine Angels.

    “W-woah. How did you - wait, I can’t, er-”

    “Yes, I was wondering about that,” Yara says, raising an eyebrow at Clarity. “Jessamine has only just gotten her glow under control and you’re assuming she’s also learned personal disguise magic in the last twelve hours? Most of which she was ostensibly asleep?” He glances at you. “You weren’t staying up to practice spells, were you?”

    You shake your head. Clarity laughs again. “Don’t worry; you’ve got me! Here, I just need to form a connection quickly. May I have your hand for a moment?”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1182879298554695810 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1182879298554695810><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, December 8, 2023 10:00 PM">10:00 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Er, sure?” You let Clarity hold your hand for almost ten seconds as she focuses. You know what she’s doing, roughly; she’s forming a connection between her Soul manifested in phase with the Body aspect, and your Body. Er, sort of. You’re pretty sure? Anyway, you know that Angels need to physically touch someone in order to affect their Body with magic, so that’s what’s happening right now.

    “And done!” You feel a brief tingle, then not much else. “Here, take a look!”

    Clarity has a mirror, because of course she does. You already have an idea what you’re going to see, but it’s still a bit of a shock to see Jessamine the human looking back instead of Jessamine the Angel. You’re still recognizably yourself, but you look like the ordinary kid you used to be instead of the beautiful Angel you are now. The fact that you did the ribbon wrong is now much more obvious. Darn.

    “...”

    “Don’t worry, the real you is still under there; it’s just an illusion! It’ll run out on its own after about an hour if I don’t recharge it, too, so we’re going to need to be careful to remember that.”

    Yara peers at the top of your head. “I think you may have missed... oh, no, nevermind. This is impressive work, Clarity. I didn’t know you were capable of holding an external transmutation like this.”

    She beams at him. “I’ve been practicing just for this! I still think it’s unfair illusions like this aren’t projections, but if you want the tactile feeling...”

    “Oh yes, I can <em>relate!</em> A real hassle. Speaking of, is Denn actually capable of disguising himself like this? He’s only a second year; I didn’t know they were teaching it so early.”

    “He is! For <em>reasons!</em> Hehe!”

    “You’re a real nutcase, you know.”

    She winks, but does not elaborate on the “reasons.”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1182879304783241316 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1182879304783241316><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, December 8, 2023 10:00 PM">10:00 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The three of you hang out for another few minutes, watching various Angels come and go. Some are in uniform, but many others aren’t; some are even disguised as humans in a similar way to you. It’s a little hard to tell who’s actually an Angel like this, but according to Yara, the disguise doesn’t work on the Soul so it’s still obvious to him. You’ll have to get better.

    Denn arrives not long after in a moderately more modest outfit: a tan vest over a cream shirt and standard dark brown trousers, like any ordinary banker would wear in the city. He doesn’t quite fit in with your group, but a quick addition of a vibrant tie-like thing (you’re not sure what it’s called; it’s not <em>quite</em> a real tie) and another ribbon from Clarity somehow ties (heh) you all together with a splash of bright color. Now he looks more like a banker’s rich son, which probably works better if you’re going to all go out together.

    After that, Clarity leads the way towards one of the Cathedra’s outer gates and your first visit to the outside world in two whole months. You know she has a whole mysterious “something special” planned for the day, but... maybe you’ll have some extra time?

    <em>Scene 32</em>
    You’re not sure. It might be a stretch to think you can visit your family today - you had no idea you’d be leaving the Cathedra and thus haven’t planned ahead to even know where they’ll be - but it has been two months. You’d like to. Well, maybe you’ll just see what Clarity has in store first and then see if you can make some time later. Founding Day isn’t too far away, anyway, so it should only be another month at most even if today doesn’t work out.

    A whole month more, huh...

    “Four Angels heading out for the day,” Clarity tells the armored guards by the gate.

    One of them checks each of your disguises, doing a quick once-over to make sure your Angelic appearance isn’t visible and that your clothes feel real. That’s why you couldn’t just change your clothes in an illusion the same way as your Body, Clarity told you earlier. It’s really hard to change the shape of something to that degree in a way that feels convincing, so you’d basically just be stuck with an outfit that looks like an Angel uniform but in a different color or material. Not particularly discreet. Very experienced Angels could pull it off regardless, but it’s so much easier to just wear regular clothes.

    “Looks good,” the guard says. “Soul check, please?”

    You’re not sure what he means until the other three begin to softly glow, displaying their Souls through light. You get the idea and quickly turn yours on as well, beyond grateful that you finally got to the point of being able to keep it turned off for most of a full day <em>just the day before yesterday</em>. Talk about tight timing.

    “Good, good. You’re free to go; be back by night bell.” As you pass through the gate, the guard nods to you specifically in admiration. “Particularly impressive, young Miss Angel. Never seen such a solid disguise from one so young.”

    “Oh, er, th-thank you,” you stammer, quickly turning to Clarity as soon as you’re out of earshot. “He thought this is my spell! Is it supposed to be?!”

Now, come on; we’ve got a train to catch!”

    You calm down a little, glancing back at the Cathedra once or twice before it’s swallowed by the mist. It’s a warm spring day by now and the fog is light, but your vision is still limited to just a few blocks. The streets are busy but not packed; people from all walks of life are hurrying or ambling along to wherever their destination happens to be. The four of you are certainly among the most well-off-looking groups around, but not to an extravagant degree. Especially near downtown, there are plenty of other people wearing similarly nice outfits. Some people give you a second look, but no one gives you more than that.

    “Hey, er, Denn, would you happen to know where she’s taking us?”

    “Nope!” he says happily. “She said I’d be needed, s’here I am. Nothin’ ‘bout what I’d be needed for.”

    “It’s just, she said we’re taking a train and we already passed the Cathedra station... Er, wait, does this have anything to do with why you already know how to disguise yourself?”

    He shrugs. “Could be.”

    You wait several paces. “Erm, would you, uh, mind sharing?”

    “S’nothin’ special. One’a my courses has us goin’ into the city a lot, so I gotta be real sneaky sometimes.”

    “Really? Which one?” You didn’t know there even were courses that took place outside of the Cathedra grounds.

    “Mind magic. We do trainin’ at the Cathedra too, but s’important t’know how normal people think, y’know? So sometimes we go out n’listen to people. With ears n’Minds.”

    “Huh. That makes sense.”

    “Mm hmm.”

You’ve been here a few times, but it’s still impressive to have so much open space around you that you can only faintly make out the borders of the square through the mist. There’s the city administrative offices to the right and the massive central station to the left; you can hear distant train bells from here. None of that is new; what <em>is</em> new is the vast number of portable stalls that have popped up in the square, most hawking some sort of merchandise or souvenir.

    Of course, you don’t have any money. As you previously noted, being an Angel doesn’t pay anything until you graduate.

    “Come on, everyone! Off to the station!” Clarity rushes off excitedly, but doesn’t get very far before she gets distracted by a vendor selling little ceramic figurines. “Ooh, look, it’s you, Jess! That lovely blonde hair!” she exclaims, holding up a figure of a fluffy golden dog with its head posed in a haughty manner as if to say “Look at how beautiful I am.”

    “Er...”

    “That’s clearly <em>you</em>, dear,” Yara refutes, scanning through the carvings before picking out a different one. “Now <em>this</em> is our dear Jessamine.” It’s a small striped cat with its nose to the ground, sniffing out some trail of clues or treats. “Always so inquisitive and diligent, but also...” He points to a different cat, tail poofed up as if it had just seen a ghost. “... easily startled.”

    “Um-”

    Denn sagely holds up a figurine of a shining banana with intricate, fluffy wings for your inspection. “It’s you.”

    “... How?”

    “Destined t’soar, like a fruit.”

    “...?”

    “No, no, he’s onto something.” Yara puts down his cats, leaning on Denn’s shoulder. You forget just how tall he is sometimes. “The curve, here, like a boomerang. You’ll be sent off into the sky, but will always return to those you care about. So moving!”

    “... ?!?!”

    <em>Scene 33</em>
    Nucarreo’s central station is bustling with activity, as you might expect from the biggest rail hub in the city. Clarity heads over to the counter to buy your tickets, but waves the rest of you off before you can come with. “It’s still a secret!” she says. “Just waaiiit~!”

    So the rest of you stand around nearby, watching her talk to the agent. “It’s not like she can hide what <em>train</em> we’ll be getting on,” Yara notes. “So her secret will last another few minutes at most.”

    Okay, you’ve got to know at this point. “Hey, where... is she getting all the money to pay for this? The clothes, the banana, the train?” You pause a moment, thinking. “Don’t tell me I’ve missed some allowance I’m supposed to be getting?!”

    Yara chuckles; Denn stays quiet but smiles a little. He seems content to do that pretty often, you’ve noticed. “My goodness, Jessamine, has no one told you? Everyone gets a weekly stipend - and quite a considerable one at that. Have you honestly been missing out for months?”

    “Ah - er... N-no one said anything-” You can’t decide if you’re more embarrassed or-

    Denn pats you on the shoulder. “Is a lie.”

    “Wha - <em>Yara?!”</em>

    A much fuller laugh this time. “Sorry, sorry. A tasteless trick, I know.”

    You grumble at him for a few seconds, but don’t have time to say anything substantial before he answers again, properly this time.

    “Clarity comes from a very wealthy family. Her father owns a large material processing company; it seems half the glass and steel for these new skyscrapers are provided by his business. So it’s no trouble for her to get a sizable allowance from her parents. After all; her... future career will pay them back many times over.”

Maybe that’s not exactly the right word - you doubt her constant excitement would fit into a serious business meeting - but... high class? That’s not quite right either.

    “‘S not her parents,” Denn says. “Met’m before. Not like her a’tall.”

    “Hey, what’s everyone staring at me for?” Clarity rushes up with the tickets, carefully distributing one to each of you. “Nothing on my face, I hope? Oh, Jess, I gotta recharge you soon. Here, just a moment!”

    She grabs your wrist and focuses for a few seconds, and that’s it. No shiny lights or anything, which is definitely good because you’re standing in a crowded train station. “All done! Anyway, c’mon, we’ve only got a few minutes!”

    Yara examines the ticket as you start walking. “Limited Express to fourth district central? There’s not much around that station besides offices; what in the world are we doing there?”

    “Hehe!”

    “Of course; why did I even ask?”

    As you make your way onto the platform and watch the heavy brass locomotive pull in, you’re reminded of those occasional family trips you took as a kid. Your parents might not have been rich, but they still managed to treat you and Seth every so often. The train rides themselves became part of the vacation, just because of how novel they were. How fast you rocketed through the city, watching everyone from above. But it’s a little different now. No mom, no dad, no Seth. Instead, Yara and Clarity are debating the shape of the train’s figurehead while Denn provides occasional non-sequiturs from nearby. You half-smile, but you’re not sure if it’s from the past or the present.

Gone are the rich wood and brass accents, replaced by much cheaper construction designed for heavy use. The seats are different, too; there are two sets of two facing forward instead of two sets of one facing inward. This is what you remember from your older train journeys.

    Clarity pulls Denn over to sit next to her, citing the need for a “secret strategy meeting,” so you and Yara end up next to each other. He kindly offers you the window seat, though he does point out he can likely just look over you and still see out himself when you accuse him of being too nice.

    You take the window seat, grumbling something about not being done growing taller yet.

    “...” You glance over at Clarity again, but she’s legitimately whispering to Denn and can’t be overheard; the train’s clattering wheels are just too loud.

    Yara follows your glance. “One day I hope to understand her. At least with Ets, she’s very direct. No ambiguity or secrets with her!”

    “-” You were about to ask Yara about his past before becoming an Angel - after the revelation about Clarity, you realized you don’t actually know much about any of your friends’ histories - but him just bringing up Etalyn out of nowhere like this... Oh, you and Serri have been scheming. Well, not <em>scheming</em> - more like debating what’s actually going on between them? Yara had actually invited Etalyn along as well, but apparently she’s busy doing a demonstration match for one of the bishops involved in overseeing combat preparation. Now, of all days? You suppose no one has any courses today so scheduling is easy, but it does mean she doesn’t get a day off to enjoy the holiday. And of course Serri couldn’t come because she still can’t turn off her glow consistently. It’s honestly lucky <em>you</em> could even come along.

    “So... Yara...”

    “Mm?”

    “What, er, what about you...r family? S-since we were talking about Clarity’s...”

    “Ah, you wanted to know if I’m also rich enough to buy banana figurines on a whim?”

    “Er, not exactly...”

    He seems to get it. “Fair warning, though, if you proceed down this path, I <em>will</em> ask about your family as well.”

    “That’s only fair.”

    “Hmm. Let’s see...” He crosses his arms, looking over you and out the window just as he had previously noted. That’s a little unusual; he normally looks at whoever he’s talking to. “My parents and older sister died when I was quite young. I don’t remember them very well.”

    Oh. Oh dear. “I-I’m sorry-”

    “No, no, don’t worry about it. I was raised by an aunt until I turned twelve and, well, you know the rest. I don’t keep in touch with her these days.”

    “...” He still isn’t looking at you. And the lack of any significant detail means he really doesn’t want to talk about it. You may have spoiled the mood a little bit. “Sorry...” you repeat, not sure what else to say.

    “Chin up, Jessamine; just look at me now. I’ve been doing quite well in the years since and there’s no need to feel sorry about it. After all, who wouldn’t want to be me?” A little wink; there’s the confidence back. Or at least the <em>appearance</em> of confidence. “Now, I believe I threatened to ask you a certain question as well. Do you have a similarly dour tale to tell?”

    “Oh, er, not really.” You hesitate to share your really quite pleasant family life, but Yara waves you on impatiently. “M-my dad is a gearworker and my mom does tutoring for the school. She helps girls learn reading and writing, mostly, but sometimes some boys who are falling behind the basics too. And dad... he’s really busy because everyone needs good gearworkers to make all the technology.”

    “Ah, an educated pair. I can tell where you get your talent, eh?”

Y-yeah.” A gearworker is the title given to the skilled professionals who design, construct, and maintain the complicated mechanical parts that form the basis of most modern machines. The word made more sense when clockwork gears powered the world, but names didn’t change with the advent of steam power; only the work did. Your dad still spends plenty of time around gears though, carefully machining each part to the proper size to use in everything from mechanical lamps to the train you’re riding right now.

    “I’ve also got a twin brother, Seth. He’s...” What can you say to sum him up in a few words? “He’s...” Fun? Energetic? Protective? Annoying at times? “... Good. He took care of me when I was sick. And after that, too. Well, until a few months ago...”

    “Ah, I remember someone mentioning that a while ago. You had to stay in the hospital for a while?”

    “...” It’s still not pleasant to think about, even though your new Body has driven out your old sickness entirely. Or at least as entirely as you can tell. Sometimes you still dream about it and wake up terrified that you’ll start coughing again. “Yeah. It started when I was six and took until I was eight to get better enough to leave. It wasn’t... fun.”

    “I understand,” Yara says quietly. “At least partially. I had to stay at a shelter for almost two months before the aunt took me in. I remember feeling trapped. Every day I’d look at the single tree outside and wish I could just leave. Wander off into the fog.” He blinks, refocusing. “Perhaps it wasn’t like that for you.”

The fog got thick enough that from your room on the second floor, days would occasionally go by where you couldn’t see anything but a misty, dreary greyness from dawn to dusk. Trapped in a single closed-off room with no human contact for fear your sickness would spread. Sometimes you would go to the window and wonder what it would be like to just walk out of it, into the sky and mist. “It... was like that. At least, at first. It got better after they decided it couldn’t spread and my family could visit.”

    “Well, I’m glad you came out of it healthy,” he declares. “At least, you seem perfectly healthy now.”

    “Y-yeah, I am.” <em>I think.</em> “I got better after, er, a few months ago.”

    “Ah. Another reason to be thankful for God, I suppose.”

    “Yeah...”

    ...

    “Goodness, what happened to you two?” Clarity asks as you disembark at the fourth district station. “You were so cheery before getting on the train!”

    “I’m afraid Jessamine here pried into my dark, secret past,” Yara laments. “Poor girl may be scarred for life if we’re not careful.”

    “I’m not - it’s okay - we just, er, yeah. Talked about... the past.”

    “Well, I hope you’re ready to perk right back up again, because we’ve made it to lovely, scenic district four!” She gestures broadly across the tracks to the cluttered, off-brown office buildings crowded around the station. You stare at her, then the buildings, then her again. “Ah - I see that look, Jess. There’s more here than meets the eye! Now, follow along to our next exciting stop!”

    “Real bundle of energy, that one,” Yara remarks as the three of you follow Clarity out of the station at a more sedate pace. “Makes me wonder what she’d be like if she had stayed in her old life. More serious, mayhaps? Or more boring?”

    “Less like fruit,” Denn advises.

    <em>Scene 35</em>
    Denn walks ahead of you, alongside Clarity, and directs her to the right streets. At least, that’s what you assume is happening as he gently guides her towards or away from certain turns. Odd, you thought he didn’t know where you were going either. Maybe she told him during that “secret strategy meeting.” But then why wouldn’t she be leading anyway, as the person who planned all this? Well, whatever, it’s not like you’re going to get a straight answer out of them.

    The area here has seen better days, but it’s not falling apart just yet. Most of the buildings around are three or four story brick boxes, stained with years of wear and tear but still in generally decent shape. Most seem to be offices or mixed with commercial on the bottom floor, but as you continue along, you start to deviate away from the main streets into narrower alleyways with residential-looking midrises shadowing the foggy sky. Here, Denn starts to pay more attention and often pauses a few beats at each intersection before continuing. Clarity seems content to follow a few paces behind without saying much.

    There are occasional people around, but not many. Most citizens are out near district centers for the holiday, so those who remain tend to be those too old, young, or infirm to move around easily. The four of you definitely stand out more now, but no one seems to pay much attention regardless.

    Finally, you unceremoniously arrive at a nondescript residential building and stop. “Here y’are,” Denn says, stepping back as if he were a coachman.

    “And where exactly are we?” Yara asks. “Don’t tell me you’ve been apartment-hunting this whole time?”

    “Hehe, nope! Give it a minute; someone’s coming down to meet us.”

    “Watching from the windows, were they?”

    “Nope! Denn told them we’re here.”

    “Huh?” You glance at him; he smiles innocently. “But how did you-”

But <em>Yara</em> has. “Wh-what? Sister Bagley?!”

    “Hello, Yara! Come in, come in; I’m sure you have some questions.”

    He sure does.

    “So, how did you... I suppose ‘what happened?’ would be the question to ask,” Yara decides once you’ve made it up to the third floor apartment that was, apparently, your destination this whole time. “So... what happened?”

    “Well, for the short version...” She considers a moment. “Brother Cobb arrived with an Inquisitor, but between the two of us, we were able to convince him that I wasn’t a threat to the Cathedra. The Inquisitor left, Lemuel helped me gather my things, and off I went. Of course, I didn’t have much of an idea what to do next, so I ended up wandering down to the grand church for some solace.

    “It really wasn’t much later that Veriline - I suppose Sister Noll to you four - arrived alongside a number of her trainees, saying a number of monks had already agreed to help out. I stayed with her family for a few days - lovely people, by the way - before we were able to find this little apartment. And a certain very sweet young lady was kind enough to search out some employment so I’ll be able to afford it.”

    Everyone eyes Clarity. She puts her hands up. “What? That could have been <em>anyone!</em> It could have been a complete coincidence that my dad’s company was hiring clerks this week!”

    “But it wasn’t,” Yara asserts.

    “Well... no...”

    “So you see, I’m doing alright here, Yara. But you don’t need to worry about me; I heard what happened and I’m just so glad the two of you are safe. I never should have approved that experiment. I’m truly sorry I put you in danger.”

    “Oh, no, no; I should be apologizing for getting Jessamine involved-” <em>You did,</em> you think, but don’t interrupt him. “- but the experiment itself was sound. You heard of the results, then?”

I still don’t know why exactly, but there are some mentions of the color in very old manuscripts from just after the year zero cataclysm. And Etalyn told me that other full Angels are interested as well; they were searching my lab for clues... and... ah, yes.”

    “Yara, please. You have to leave this alone, at least for the near future. I know discoveries like this are terribly exciting, but it’s just too dangerous for you. Look what happened with just a <em>taste</em> of this sort of thing! You simply don’t have the experience to do this safely, and I was a fool for telling you otherwise. Please, wait at least another decade for your Soul to mature. You’ll have plenty of time.”

    “Yara, you promised.” you remind him. “You said you’d wait.”

    “I said I would slow down. And I have; there’s been no more experimentation since then!”

    “It’s only been a week!”

    “I’m being careful!”

    “Yara...” Sister Bagley seems conflicted, but makes up her Mind quickly. “Ask Sister Noll what happened to Jennan Gifford when you get back. You can tell her I put you up to this, since she’ll be upset.”

    “...Why?”

    “Unpleasant memories. Still, if you want to dedicate yourself to this path, I believe you need to know what it will cost you and those around you.”

    “... Very ominous. I’ll ask her.” A little sigh. “Honestly, you’re such a teacher, Sister. We came here to check on <em>you</em> (although only one of us knew that) and you’ve made it about <em>me</em>.”

    “Well, that’s what the instructor position does to you. I expect I’ll miss it, once things settle down.”

    “It’s ridiculous how they fired you just for this,” Yara declares. “You’ve been so dedicated for decades!”

    “...” Yara pauses for several seconds, but eventually seems to accept it. “I suppose He does.”

    You suppose He does, too. At least Sister Bagley seems okay, and so many people pitched in to help her out. This whole event could have turned out so much worse. Maybe that’s enough.

    <em>Scene 36</em>
    ... No, you don’t buy that. Not entirely. God may have a plan, but He wasn’t the one to fire Sister Bagley. He chooses Angels, but humans confirm them. He provides strength and guidance, but <em>people</em> decide what to do with it. What happened wasn’t fair. Isn’t fair. You’re sure there’s more to it, and you owe it to Sister Bagley (and Yara, and yourself) to find out what.

    But... you’re going to have to be careful in your search. Although you and Yara and the rest of the Angels may have some measure of divine protection, it’s very clear that anything you try can get other people hurt. Plus... the way she was talking about Jennan Gifford... The name sounds familiar. You don’t quite recall why, but - actually, you could probably just ask right now.

    Other people have been talking about something else now. You patiently wait your turn, eventually realize you won’t find a natural break in the conversation, and sort of shelve the idea. You’ll ask later. You’ll remember.

    ...

    You didn’t remember. It’s past afternoon bell now and the four of you are back on the streets heading back to the station. Honestly, you’re not sure where all the time went. Yara’s the only one who really knows Sister Bagley, but all of you stayed quite a while helping her get set up, exploring the immediate area, and just generally hanging out. You couldn’t point to any specific thing that took a while; you just... did a lot of things.

    Clarity seems to have one more stop in mind, so (given the late hour), you reluctantly put down your idea of trying to track down your family without ever having brought it up. Everyone else just always seemed to have more important things to do. Anyway, you’ve still got two questions that you want answered before you get back on the train and you’re not going to stay quiet this time. Alright, no one’s talking now. Ready? “H-”

It was lovely to have you along, but well, nothing happened.”

    “Nothing happened?!” Clarity interrupts. “Do we need to go back there and remind you what we spent the day doing?”

    “No, no; I’m very grateful you brought us here. I was worried about her; at least I now know she’s alive and healthy. But Denn had never even met her before. Don’t tell me this redheaded menace brought you all the way here just to use as a glorified doorbell?”

    “Mm. Not quite.” Denn nods left; your group turns. “Good at Mind. Sensing trouble b’fore it starts.” He shrugs towards Clarity. “Asked m’to take a look for c’rruption seeds. Also, t’keep us outta trouble n’the streets.”

    “Corruption? Ah, you were worried about her. That’s very sweet, but Bagley’s made of strong stuff. I could have told you she’d be fine.”

    “It’s good to be sure, especially after such a big, erm... upheaval? I plan on asking you to come back a few more times, by the way. If that’s okay with you.”

    Denn shrugs. “M’needed. I will help.”

    “Corruption...” you whisper, just to yourself. You hadn’t even considered that, really. You know from your courses that there are many ways for a human to succumb to the corruption: direct contact with a shade or other darkness creature, exposure to the wastelands’ poison, and (most relevant here) a sickness of Mind or Body. All three aspects of the self are linked and each can affect the others, though the Soul is the most resistant to change of the three. It’s not easy to fall into corruption just from a debilitating illness or a heavy depression - if it were, you probably would have during your stay at the hospital - but... it is possible. Translating that academic understanding into real danger, though, wasn’t something you had thought of. You should be more cautious. It’s your duty.

    Ah, Clarity noticed you muttering. “N-nothing. Just... thinking.”

    “Mm! Anything in particular you’re thinking about? You’ve been pretty quiet since we left.”

    “I, erm...” Had you been unusually quiet? You hadn’t noticed. Better think of something to- “Wh-who was Jennan Gifford?” you blurt out, surprising yourself.

    “Huh? That’s the person Sister Bagley mentioned, right? I’m not sure, but the name does sound familiar...”

    “Never heard,” Denn says casually.

    “Yara?”

    He shakes his head softly. “She was a trainee Angel a few years back. Studied Soul magic a lot, but neglected her combat training. She was killed within a month of graduation in an unlucky visit to the wastelands; the other Angels with her couldn’t do anything because it all happened so fast.” He glances away, brow furrowed. “Her interests were similar to my own, which I assume is why Bagley brought it up.”

    “...” Clarity stays quiet in an unusual moment of solemnity. You try to do the same, but-

    “What about - erk-” You almost lose your nerve as everyone looks at you, but manage to recover. “What about h-her second chance?”

    Even as the words leave your mouth, you remember Brother Cobb’s answer to that very question. Yara echoes it. “Nothing stops whatever killed you from doing it again. She must have died twice in a matter of seconds.”

    “...”

    You really know how to bring down the mood. First digging into Yara’s past on the train; now asking about an Angel’s tragic death... You couldn’t have known, but still. Not great.

    “Well, here’s the station,” Clarity eventually points out, as if any of you could miss the giant building and its tangle of train tracks. “Our last stop today was going to be a nice restaurant in the third district, but if anyone would rather just head back-”

    “Clarity, please. Would I <em>ever</em> turn down a high class dinner on someone else’s coin? (You are paying, right?)”

    “Yes, of course!”

    “Then no more gloomy talk! Away; our noble vehicle awaits!”

    <em>Scene 37</em>
    Today is Monday, June 3rd, Founding Day, and you aren’t pleased about it. Well, the day itself is fine - and the fact that you and Serri are about to start your basic magic course is even better - but did Brother Cobb have to start it <em>today?</em> You had originally planned to go visit your family on Founding Day, but were reminded of your Angelic obligations just a week ago when you and Serri demonstrated your control over your Souls in order to formally register for the course.

    Apparently (according to Yara and Etalyn since you didn’t want to ask Brother Cobb directly) he does it this way because he shows you “something that takes the whole day” and doesn’t want to conflict with any other courses. Sure, that’s fine, but he could do that on any Sulday or Sunday and not have to take up a holiday for it! Well, there’s nothing to do but swallow your grumbles and go anyway; in a class of three students, your absence would be incredibly obvious and incredibly disrespectful. The next major day off is in a bit more than a month, so it’s not <em>that</em> much longer to wait.

    A whole month more (again), huh...

    Things have settled down since the events of late April and the Day of the Wall. Yara went and talked to Sister Noll, as promised, and seems to be mostly keeping to the more approved avenues of magic. Etalyn’s been practicing physical transmutation with him recently, though she’s not very good at it yet. They both seem to be enjoying it anyway.

    The weather is warm now, and most Angels are now wearing their uniforms with the coats fully unbuttoned or even missing entirely in some cases. Apparently it’s okay to just wear the top without the coat while <em>inside</em> the Cathedra, but you’re not allowed to leave like that. Doesn’t matter much to you, since you’re not allowed out except on holidays anyway, so you’ve been leaving your coat behind recently. It’s still kind of chilly in the mornings, but it warms up quickly.

Which pretty much means you’ll be leaving the Cathedra today, unless he was pranking you. It would be a pretty weird prank if he were.

    And when you arrive at the classroom in Illim Hall, you’re assured fairly quickly that you’re right. Erich is already here and Serri came with you, meaning you’re only waiting for Brother Cobb. The hourly bell hasn’t rung yet, but you kind of figured he’d be here first.

    “Morning.” Erich nods briefly as he greets you. “Are the two of you prepared for your first magical challenge?”

    You and Serri glance at each other. She waits for you to respond; she doesn’t like Erich. “... Yes? I didn’t know there was a, well, challenge today. None of us know magic yet.”

    “Hmph. Spoken like someone who <em>hasn’t</em> done the pre-reading. I’m surprised, Jessamine.”

    “Wh - hey, I did the reading! What are you talking about?” You’re not lying, of course; you’re generally responsible <em>and</em> really excited about the subject matter. But that doesn’t change the fact that none of you <em>do</em> know magic yet. Unless Erich has been working ahead. Well, more than you thought he was.

    “Then you must be familiar with the concepts of resonance phases and channeling?”

    “Y-yeah.”

    “So, what have you been learning how to do for the past several months?” His tone is patient, but almost insultingly so. Like he’s explaining it to a child.

    “... Mostly just suppressing the glow.”

    “<em>Beyond</em> that.”

    “Being able to sense Souls, or use your Soul to sense things?”

    “Adjusting your own resonance phase, yes. So if you combine that with the channeling practice you must have been doing on your own time, surely you understand how limiting your earlier declaration is.”

On your own time? “... Fine, but that’s not really <em>real</em> magic.” You sort of get what he’s going for here; theoretically all magic is just using your Soul to interact with other things directly. If you know how to change your phase to something and channel your Soul to touch that something, you can - in theory - do magic on that something. But that’s such a massive simplification that it hardly makes sense to apply it to the three of you - until recently, you couldn’t even get your Soul to stay inside your own Body where it belongs!

    “Ah, but is it not magic at its purest form? To simply reach out and touch another Soul? Ordinary humans can’t even dream of such potential.”

    Okay, time to try and change track. “Erich, do you know what we’re doing today?”

    “Of course. Today, our instructor will be taking us out to the walls, where we will undergo the <em>challenge</em> I mentioned earlier.”

    “The challenge, which is...?”

    “Good morning, all,” Brother Cobb interrupts, arriving within seconds of the hourly bell. “Quickly now, off to the station! We’re on a tight schedule!”

    Off he goes. The three of you hurry after him, catching up without much effort due to his age and your Angelic speed. Somewhat surprising you, it’s actually Serri who speaks up on the way. “Um, Brother Cobb, what are we doing today?”

    “I will explain it all on the train, Ms Ambrose, but I assure you, it will be well worth the trip.”

    You can’t decide if that’s encouraging or concerning. Probably more the latter, assuming Erich is right. He usually is, annoyingly.

You’re going to be spending a whole year with him and Serri in this course, so you’d probably better figure out how you’re going to treat him. So far, you haven’t interacted much, but you already don’t really like him. Still, with only three people (plus Brother Cobb) for a whole year... maybe you should give him another chance? Get to know him a little better? You really don’t know anything about him besides the very surface level stuff.

    Or maybe not. You’re already a little grumpy today; if you talk to him too much you might say something Brother Cobb wouldn’t approve of.

    <em>Scene 38</em>
    You internally sigh and resolve to give him another chance. This week should be enough, you think. You’ll be nice for the week, see what he does, and see how well you can get along. Then you’ll make a decision.

    There’s not much time to chat on the train, though. You’re back in a private, fancy carriage like when you first became an Angel and Brother Cobb seems to intend to hold class on the way out to the walls. He’s got time; even going as fast as you are, it’ll still take the majority of an hour to make it all the way to the city’s outskirts. Nucarreo is enormous, though according to Brother Trigg, it’s a shadow of what it was before the cataclysm. You find it hard to believe a city even <em>could</em> be much larger than this; wouldn’t it get too big to move through and manage? You’d need so many more farms than even what you have now!

    “Today,” Brother Cobb announces as the train accelerates away from the Cathedra, “You will meet the corruption.”

    The three of you stare at him, two in shock and one in... anticipation? Erich already knew, clearly.

    “It will be safe. A group of Angels has worked hard to capture a weakened creature of Mindless darkness for us, so that you three can understand what you will fight. It will be contained and heavily weakened, though I refuse to say it will be <em>completely</em> safe. Keep your guard up when I say so and always be prepared to unveil your Soul and run away.”

    “You m-mean like turning the glow back on?”

    “Precisely. The burst of divine energy will disorient the creature, allowing the full Angels with us to dispatch it - should the need arise, of course. In all likelihood, it will stay safely contained and there will be no issue.”

    “We’re going to get to kill it, right?” Erich seems very excited about the prospect.

As all three of you have demonstrated your ability to sense and touch other Souls - to a certain degree, of course - you already understand the basic concepts of shifting your aspect of perception to a different resonance phase. This does not mean that you are capable of changing your own Soul’s resonance phase yet, but you won’t need to in order to burn away the darkness. As it is a corruption of the Soul, the Soul is the aspect you will need to touch in order to cleanse it.

    “Similarly, we aren’t asking you to channel quite yet; manipulating the shape of your Soul in such a way is a little too advanced to start with. Instead, you will simply get close and, with a physical touch, allow your Soul to touch as well. Even young Angels such as yourselves should have enough total divine energy to burn away a creature on your own, but I don’t expect you to have the necessary skill to yet do so. Instead, this exercise is designed merely so you understand what it <em>feels like</em> early on, to test your Soul against the corruption and to emerge unharmed. I’m told it’s an experience you don’t easily forget.”

    “I’ve been studying diligently. I will destroy it.”

    Now he seems more than just excited about it. Brother Cobb nods. “I’m certain you have, and I believe you will do well even if the creature survives. Again, your objective today is not to destroy a single creature; it is to understand the corruption so you can better fight it later, when you have the required skills and strength to do so.”

He’s determined to kill the creature, no matter what Cobb says. Serri, on the other hand, doesn’t seem the least bit excited to come face to face with the corruption. You’re certain she’d rather be back at the Cathedra learning from a book or regular, safe practice. As for you... you’re not sure. Well, you did just resolve to keep an open mind about Erich, so maybe you should do the same here. Seeing the corruption and facing it directly... you don’t know if you’re ready, but you can’t deny your curiosity.

    Brother Cobb discusses additional basic theory as the train speeds along. You talk about the three aspects, the concept of Soul resonance and how you can shift it to a different aspect - and phase within that aspect - to focus on a specific object, and how you need a connection in order to do so.

    “In order to affect anything with your Soul, you must attune your own resonance to your target’s aspect and, ideally, phase. Each aspect has a different form of connection: physical and Body use a physical connection, Mind uses mental, and Soul uses spiritual. Now, can anyone explain why physical and Body share the same connection type?”

    “Because they’re both attuned to the aspect of Body,” Erich answers promptly.

    “Correct, but <em>why?</em> Why do your Body and the world around you share this aspect?”

    “Because they’re both physical objects in the world.”

    “And is your Body not special? One of the three aspects of the self in a way that, say, this train is not? What is the difference?”

    “...”

It has to be obvious, right? But when you think about it a little more, you’re not sure. Plants are classified under physical magic, not Body, which means it can’t just be something that’s alive. But animals are classified under Body, not physical, which means it can’t be the presence of a Soul. Is it the presence of a Mind? But how does that affect your Body when it’s its own different aspect?

    <em>Scene 39</em>
    Ah, maybe it’s... “Is it the ability to be corrupted?” you say uncertainly.

    “Hm? Can you elaborate?”

    Oh no. “W-well, people can be corrupted and turn into darkness creatures, and so can animals. But I’ve never heard of a plant or an object changing like that, so maybe that’s the difference?”

    “Mmm. So what of the darkness burrowing into the planet itself after it fled our Souls? Would you consider that corruption?”

    “That’s, um, more like a... carrier? Because it doesn’t affect the planet like it would a person.”

    “I see. A good hypothesis, but unfortunately the planet (and plants, and objects in general) are corrupted in the same way as humans and animals. They don’t become darkness creatures because they aren’t creatures at all, but when you have seen the wastelands and the pitiful plants that reside within them, you will understand the scale of the planetary corruption against us.”

    “Oh...” Erich looks kinda smug. Jerk; at least you tried. Wait, you’re supposed to be being nice.

    “Apologies,” Brother Cobb continues after a few moments. “But it was somewhat of a trick question. The truth is that there isn’t a tangible difference between objects and Bodies - at least on an aspect level. They’re made of the same type of matter; we just classify them differently for convenient spell grouping, as the techniques needed to work with (usually) people are significantly different than those needed to work with inanimate objects.”

    “Wait, there’s... <em>no</em> difference? But you can’t... a train isn’t a Body; you can’t <em>live</em> as a train!” Now you just want answers; you’re not worried about what Erich thinks of you.

    “Why not?”

    “Er-” Is this a trick question too? Of course you can’t live as a train! “It’s... not alive?”

    “Ah, but it can move and act. It consumes food and produces waste.”

    “B-but it doesn’t do that on its own!”

And it’s true that objects do not have Minds and do not live in the same way as humans do.” Cobb refocuses, preparing to actually explain what he means. You hope, at least. “There is no difference at the base level, but objects and Bodies do have a main difference outside of their aspect. Minds, for whatever reason, tend to attach to living Bodies. And Souls, of course, can only attach to human Bodies due to their respective shapes as reflections of God. Inanimate objects do not naturally attract or form Minds or Souls. So, if one were to draw a distinction, the best theoretical one would likely be ‘living things are Bodies, while inanimate things are objects.’ But, of course, you’ve already noted that plants are considered objects instead of Bodies even though they are alive.”

    You nod, about to bring that up as a counterpoint.

    “The truth is, we simply don’t know. It could be that Minds prefer or arise from living Bodies that can move and act independently, and plants are too simple and stationary to need one. It could be that plants <em>do</em> have Minds, but they’re too small or weak for even the most powerful of Angels to see them. It could be that we’ve misunderstood some fundamental aspect of creation and God has even more discoveries in store for us. That’s what being on the forefront of magical advancement is about. You three might be the ones to finally figure out the answer to this or any number of other mysteries about the world around us. And any of these mysteries might hold the key to defeating the corruption once and for all.”

    Woah. Despite yourself, you feel a little inspired. Maybe you <em>will</em> figure ou - <em>wait a minute</em>. Cobb can talk up searching for truth all he wants, but you know what the Cathedra really thinks about people making new magical discoveries. Yara disciplined and threatened; Sister Bagley fired and left to the streets outside. Make the right discoveries and maybe you’ll be praised like he’s saying. But make the <em>wrong</em> ones...

Does that mean one could do that... <em>un</em>naturally?”

    You and Erich look at Serri, surprised. You hadn’t even noticed that bit; you’d been too busy thinking about the classifications. Even Brother Cobb seems a little startled.

    “Mm. Perhaps. We got the idea from the corruption’s shades. Creatures with Minds, somehow evading God’s sacrifice to prevent the darkness from ever thinking again. It’s very difficult to study them, as you might expect, but it appears that shades are not born naturally and are formed by <em>attaching</em> a Mind to a Mindless darkness creature. At least, most of the time. Well, some of the time. It has happened, at least. So the current idea is that moving a Mind between a Body and an object is theoretically possible, but no one has yet proven it. Magic like this would be Mind transmutation of the highest order, and would face enormous resistance from the Body, Mind, and Soul templates of both the target and recipient. And of course, we have no idea what it would do to a human, so experimenting with anything besides animals is completely forbidden.”

    “You said ‘some of the time’ - how are shades <em>normally</em> created?”

    Brother Cobb sighs, but doesn’t seem terribly annoyed. “Ah, the curiosity of youth. You three have gotten us far off track now and we’ve almost arrived regardless. Fine, one more, but then we must refocus. Most shades are created from corrupted humans whose Minds don’t break or wither away with the transformation. Instead, it corrupts just like their Body and they become a creature of darkness with a twisted but ultimately still human Mind. It’s unknown whether these shades and the ones created artificially have the same type of Mind, but either are still incredibly dangerous.”

    You’ve got another question, but he did just say-

You will not have to deal with such creatures for a very long time; the one emergency I’ve witnessed like that was the only time I have seen every Archangel band together at once to destroy it.”

    Ah, good. It’s even worse than you imagined.

    The train is speeding past endless farmland now, but is beginning to slow as it approaches the last station before the city’s outermost wall. You’ve never been this close before; hopefully Brother Cobb will give you at least a little time to look around.

    <em>Scene 40</em>
    Thankfully, that’s exactly what happens. Brother Cobb needs to check your group in at the bunker buildings near the wall - apparently that’s your destination today - so he leaves the three of you in the care of a scarred wasteland soldier in drab brown fatigues.

    Of course, even as trainee Angels, you outrank the soldier (sort of? It’s tough to know exactly how the hierarchy works when you’re outside the Cathedra grounds). In any case, he seems amenable enough to your collective requests to go look at various locations nearby as long as you don’t run off.

    The train tracks you had noted earlier do indeed travel all the way through the wall and into the wastelands themselves, your guide tells you. They’re sealed off from the outside world by a pair of thick metal gates, probably even stronger than the stone wall itself and only operable from the inside. When a train needs to pass through, there must be at minimum two Angels on duty to guard the gates through the entire process. And despite there <em>technically</em> being three of you at the moment, he understandably declines to open them for you now.

    And why are there trains passing through the wall in the first place? Well...

    The wastelands are vast, travel is slow, and the air itself is poisonous. While Angels are usually strong enough to survive the poison indefinitely - and can heal the ordinary soldiers who aren’t - no treatment is perfect and it’s best for everyone involved to spend as little time out there as possible. Add that to the heavy equipment needed for ruin-delving along with recovering artifacts and you have a situation that only a powerful vehicle can solve.

Mindless creatures tend to ignore them, but shades are well aware of how important the infrastructure is and will often destroy or sabotage further-out rails. To combat this, scouting groups go ahead of the train convoy to check the condition of tracks and run repairs as needed. But of course, the shades know this too and regularly try to ambush the scouts. It’s a constant back-and-forth with the railways as main points of conflict. The soldier has heard people are trying to develop a fully mechanical vehicle that doesn’t need to run on tracks - like a horseless carriage - but so far trains remain the only solution for this particular problem.

    And then he takes you up onto the wall itself.

    Not out into the wastelands proper - that’s far too dangerous to risk you without good reason - but from this vantage point, you can at least see the corruption, in person, for the first time in your life. The fog is thinner here, as you’ve been told. Not gone entirely, but you can see a good distance into the dead, barren emptiness beyond the city.

    Or... what you <em>thought</em> would be dead, barren emptiness. The land closest to the walls, tracks, and other human-made infrastructure is merely cracked, dry dirt, as you expected. Occasional scorched stains and flakes of ash suggest why it’s so clear, because the rest of it just... isn’t.

    Endless plains of colorful vegetation stretch beyond the fog, browns and greens and purples and blues mixing in twisting, unnatural patterns. Tall, shifting grass sways hypnotically in the light breeze, each gust rippling across the field like a wave. Even a few trees - full <em>trees</em> - stand like sentinels: a broken mirror of the wall itself. The wastelands aren’t dead and empty; they’re absolutely teeming with life. But the life is... wrong. Alien. <em>Corrupted,</em> you realize.

Humans and animals don’t die when they’re corrupted; they become darkness creatures. Plants must do the same. And if Brother Cobb was correct about the ground and objects themselves becoming corrupted... You shift your gaze to the railway tracks, tracing a straight line into the fog. But, as they fade into the distance, does their color change? Do they seem a little less straight? Twisted? Alien? Corrupted? You can’t tell.

    And this landscape hates you.

    You can feel it, like that sensation you get when someone is glaring at you from across the room but a hundred times worse. The wastelands <em>despise</em> you, your divine Soul, and everything you stand for. Every tree, every blade of grass; every single speck of dirt out there wants you to die a horrible, painful death and would be more than willing to do the deed personally if only it had the chance. It’s such a strong sense of malice that you actually start to get a little worried, even up here on the wall with several trained soldiers only steps away. How could you possibly be expected to go <em>out</em> there? Into such an utterly hostile world?

    ... If this is what just the plants feel like, how bad will the <em>creatures</em> be?

Given his reaction to the concept of killing a darkness creature, you’d expect him to be simmering with hatred against the wastelands themselves, but his expression is fairly neutral. Maybe he already knew? But how could you prepare for a sensation like this, even if you did know ahead of time? You feel like you’re almost ready to cry; it’s still battering against you even as you try to distract yourself. Surely you’re not the only one weak enough to feel it so strongly, right?

    <em>Scene 41</em>
    “Hey, Serri,” you murmur. “Did you know the wastelands were like this?”

    “All full of life? No, but it makes sense when you think about what corruption does to living things. I guess the name doesn’t really fit?”

    “Yeah...” If you stay up here on this wall for another few minutes, you really are going to start sobbing. Hopefully you’ll get to leave before that happens. “But I also meant like how it feels so... evil?”

    “Huh? Of course it’s evil; it’s the corruption.”

    You’re not getting anywhere like this. Best to just be direct. “So, uh, do you not feel... it hating you?”

    “What? The plants? Sorry, I don’t get it; there’s no Mind to hate with, right?”

    “Er, nevermind. Maybe it’s just my imagination.”

    “It’s not.” You and Serri both turn to Erich; he’s stopped staring at the wastelands and decided to join your conversation.

    “Can... you feel it, then?”

    “Yes. Like a vague sense of paranoia, that something hateful is hunting you?”

    Oh no. That doesn’t sound <em>nearly</em> as bad as what you’re feeling, but at least it’s the same general concept. You decide a tiny little lie is probably the best way to go here. “Yeah... That’s it.”

    “That is the poison you’re feeling. Apparently it clings to people with strong Souls, so those with more power feel it more intensely.” He glances at you sideways. “I’m impressed, Jessamine. I didn’t think you would have reached the level where it’s perceivable yet.”

Er, th-thanks.” Those with more power feel it more intensely? But... what? You don’t think it could get much more intense than this without starting to actually cause you harm; what does that mean for your strength? Surely you aren’t <em>that</em> strong already; you’ve barely been training for a few months at this point. Does that mean something is wrong with you? Or... too right? Are you just naturally gifted? No, no; surely not. You’ve been doing fine, but you haven’t been excelling. If your Soul was that strong already, someone would have noticed. <em>You</em> would have noticed. Right?

    “Jess, are you okay? You look kinda pale... Are you crying?”

    Ack; think of something! “Er - uh - nope. It’s just, um, dry up here, with the wasteland wind.” <em>Nailed it. Except not!</em>

    Neither of them seem to buy it; you turn away from the wastelands and wipe your eyes to hide your face. “L-let’s go back down?”

    It’s only once you’re back on the ground level (feeling better as soon as the wastelands are no longer in view) and Brother Cobb has rejoined your group that you start to realize some of the subtext you didn’t notice initially. Serri was upset that she couldn’t sense anything - that much is blindingly obvious from how she’s kind of avoiding both of you now. But Erich... you’re not entirely sure what to make of his much more frequent glances. You did start crying immediately after he said he was impressed, but <em>surely</em> he doesn’t think you meant anything by it. He’s probably just feeling smug that he can handle the wastelands’ hate better than you, without being aware that they seem to hate you far more. That seems far more like him.

You have to go through a security checkpoint where you’re required to show your Soul again, then a set of thick metal doors. Now, technically, you are outside of the city. Outside of its main security perimeter, at least. Outside with the wastelands that want to kill you.

    It kind of looks like Illim Hall’s basement. Long, windowless hallways with metal doors leading to various secure labs and cells and other rooms. There aren’t many people here, but the ones who are tend to be either wasteland soldiers or monks in robes that mark them as Cathedra researchers. There aren’t any Angels visible beyond the two with you, which you suppose does make sense. There are only so many of you to protect the entire city. Even in places like this, having more than two would be too many. In fact, listening to the conversations you pass as you wind through the halls, there would normally only be one Angel here; the second is only to protect you three for your visit.

    You almost shiver. Are you going to have to be the single guardian of a place like this when you graduate? Everyone relying on <em>just</em> you to fend off the corruption; any mistake you make costing the city enormously?

    Probably best not to think about that.

    Finally, you arrive at an inconspicuous metal door just like all the others. Brother Cobb gets serious. Well, more serious than he was already.

You should be able to feel it even from here, if you focus. Please take a moment to shift your perception to the Soul phase. Then we will discuss what you can sense.”

    Okay. You can do this. You’re a little nervous, but you <em>can</em> do it. Breathe in, close your eyes, and... shift.

    As with most times you use your Soul perception, touch is the sense it seems to resonate with the most. You can feel warmth all around you; three weaker Souls and two strong ones. Your companions, of course. But ahead, muffled through the door but still very much tangible, is an amplified version of that icy chill you felt back when the Archangel was treating you after Yara’s experiment. Frigid cold and... twisty. Like an icicle melted and refrozen until it forms the shape of a sharpened braid, then slid along your skin so you can feel the razor’s tip, the pressure just barely too weak to cut you open. It’s uncomfortable, to say the least, but extremely precise. That twisting sharpness is key to whatever the creature is, you’re sure of it.

    “Ready?” Brother Cobb asks, pulling you back to the physical world with his distorted voice. You really need to get better at sensing multiple phases at once, though you’ve heard that’s very tough. “We’ll start with Mr Haskell. What could you sense?”

    “It’s cold,” he says quietly. “But not angry or hateful like the wastelands outside. Small, probably the size of a chicken. The... door muffles a lot of it.”

    “Very good. At your level, through that door, all I would expect is the sensation of cold. Anything else... well, we’ll have to see how correct you are once we enter. Alright, Ms Goodall next?”

    <em>Scene 42</em>
    “Icy cold, but he’s right; it doesn’t feel like the wastelands as much as I thought it would.” You hesitate a moment, wanting to describe the sharpness and other details, but hold yourself back. Well, mostly. “I think it’s bigger than a chicken... maybe about the size of a toddler.” Wrong, you’re almost certain, but closer than Erich without being suspicious. Hopefully. You’re not entirely certain why you’re hiding what you can sense - to make Serri feel better, to not antagonize Erich, to not reveal something weird or dangerous about yourself to Brother Cobb? - but you’ve decided to do it twice now, so you’re committed.

    “Good as well. We’ll see about the creature’s size shortly. And now, Ms Ambrose?”

    “... It feels like... the opposite of a regular Soul. Cold, I guess.” She pauses a moment, eyeing you. “Everyone else said how big it is, but... I really can’t tell. How <em>can</em> you tell? Just by how cold it is?”

    You’re not immediately sure, actually. And in the time it takes you to figure out what to say, Erich has already replied. “Yes, it’s the magnitude of the force compared to that of a human Soul. The creature in there seems to be weaker than our esteemed instructor, so given the reports on a darkness creature’s size relating to its forcefulness, it was easy to make an educated guess. I assume Jessamine must have consulted the same books.”

    He looks at you in a way that makes it clear he doesn’t believe for an instant that you did. What does he think you did instead? Probably just guessed, based on what he said. But that’s not true either; it just seemed obvious to you. Like, when you look at something and see how big it is using your regular eyes. How can you explain how that works?

    So instead you don’t say anything, implicitly approving his explanation.

    “Jess, really? How much extra studying did you do without me? I thought you said we’d work together on all this!”

You <em>didn’t</em> do any extra studying! “Wa - hang on, I didn’t - er-” But you can’t just say it was natural for you, right? That might expose something that, well, you really don’t know why you’re hiding it but you need some time to figure it out! “...” You can’t come up with an excuse in time and just end up saying “Sorry...” in a way that’s so much more embarrassing with the audience. Especially since you’re apologizing for something you didn’t even do!

    “Well,” Brother Cobb cuts back in. “In any case, you’ve done well, Ms Ambrose. As I said, sensing anything beyond the mere presence of the creature is something I would consider beyond most Angels of your age. And, of course, no one said that the sizes are <em>correct.</em>” He nods to the two full Angels. “If you please?”

    One of them stands guard while the other opens the door. And without much ceremony, there it is.

    The creature is imprisoned in a glass box covered in lines of near-translucent glyphs that you’re starting to recognize as one of the pre-cataclysm languages from your history course. Two metal cylinders on opposite sides of the container stand out, but you’re not sure what they’re for specifically.

    As for the darkness creature itself, you were indeed both wrong about its size. The thing is quadrupedal and marginally bigger than a large dog, but instead of fur, colorful and lopsided chitinous plates break up cracked, dull grey skin. It’s sort of fuzzy around the edges; maybe it does have fur and it’s just really thin? You can still see evidence that it was once a regular canine in its structure, but all the details have melted or shifted or rearranged themselves into an alien form.

    Several mouths, all growling with a sound you can’t hear. Extra eyes peering from some of the plates. Wavy, dark red tendrils drifting from its back in a nonexistent air current. The thing looks like it would fit neatly in with the strange, corrupted plants in the wastelands.

There’s a heavy thud and most of you flinch, but the container holds strong. The beast claws and bites at the glass, leaving streaks of smoking saliva on the barrier. It slams itself against the wall several more times, desperate to get out and tear you apart. It hates you, just like the wastelands themselves. You can’t feel it as agonizingly strongly, but its actions are proof enough. This creature - without even a Mind with which to do so - <em>hates</em> you.

    “Unpleasant, isn’t it?” Brother Cobb notes dryly. “Imagine what the retrieval team had to go through to get this charming specimen back here.”

    You imagine it. Yikes.

    “Now, you might be wondering something else that was absent from the pre-reading I assigned. Mindless creatures of darkness, as the name implies, have no Mind. They cannot think or feel or act in the same way we do. And yet, we teach that ordinary animals - such as the wolf that this creature may have once been - <em>do</em> have Minds, and that those Minds are what separates creatures who can move and act from those that cannot, such as plants. So, how can this Mindless creature display traits that seem to require a Mind? Such as movement, sensory processing, or motivation? Any ideas?”

    <em>Scene 43</em>
    Erich doesn’t seem to want to answer questions that he isn’t confident about getting right. And Serri, despite her frustration, is still looking to you to try first. Well, you do have at least a thought.

    “Is it not completely Mindless?” you guess. “When you were talking about people becoming shades, you mentioned that Minds can corrupt, break, or wither away, so maybe there’s still something in there that lets it move around?”

    “Ah ha!” Brother Cobb seems delighted. “You’ve hit upon the Mental remnants theory of Mindless darkness. It’s one of the two main explanations for how these creatures work since, as you might guess, we don’t fully understand.” A breath; he refocuses on all three of you. “The Mental remnants theory puts forth that a Mindless darkness creature’s Mind is not completely destroyed, but rather leaves some remnants behind when it is corrupted (or spawned). These remnants are sufficient to allow it to act with simplified animalistic instincts, but insufficient to allow it to learn or otherwise implement complex strategies. Even animals will decide to avoid a trap if they’ve seen it triggered before, but Mindless creatures are incapable of even such basic thought.”

    There’s a pause as the three of you work through the idea. Then, Erich speaks up. “And the second theory?”

    “Yes, the Bodily instincts theory of Mindless darkness. That theory states that, much as the Soul can shape the Mind, the Mind can shape the Body. Therefore, the Mindless creatures’ Minds are truly gone, leaving them with only the built-in instincts and desires their Minds imparted onto their Bodies. This also explains why they are capable of movement and normal functions, as the Body would be most apt to imprint those actions, but much less capable of thought and understanding as Mental tasks alone.”

    Another pause. “So, which one is more plausible?”

The Mental remnants theory has some flaws, such as the question of how a Mind could remain for a spawned creature which does not have one to begin with, or the contradiction that - were it true - God’s act to break the darkness’ Minds would not have been fully effective. But the Bodily instincts theory has flaws as well. It shares the same question about spawned creatures, given there was no Mind to imprint on the Body, and the idea that Bodies can act on their own without any Mind at all raises unsettling questions about the nature of objects that scholars have yet to validate.” Another longish pause; sometimes you forget how often he does that. “Personally, I find the Bodily instincts theory more compelling, but not by a significant margin. I imagine we’ll need to solve the mystery of the spawning pools to know for sure.”

    The spawning pools. You’ve heard of them a few times, mostly from Yara as part of his Soul-related research. Apparently most Mindless darkness creatures aren’t formed from corrupted animals, but are instead birthed (“spawned”) from mysterious pools deep in the wastelands. Due to how far from the city most of them are, and how surrounded by corruption all of them are, the Cathedra still knows almost nothing about how they actually work. Yara seems convinced that figuring it out will mark a major breakthrough in understanding the corruption, and Brother Cobb seems to concur.

    Apparently all of you have the same semi-understanding, because no one asks for clarification. After a few more minutes of discussing the concept of Mindlessness (with the corrupted creature still slamming at the wall every so often) you get back to practicing.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1191511340448239636 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1191511340448239636><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, January 1, 2024 5:40 PM">5:40 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>You spend the rest of the morning and part of the afternoon working on sensing the corrupted creature. From inside the room, outside the room, down the hall; as far as you can go and still feel anything. Then you’re asked to pick out which door holds the creature from a selection, to aid in precision. Which direction? How close? Size? Power? Danger? Specifics? It’s a lot of work; you’ve never spent so long attuned to the Soul aspect before and it gets exhausting quickly.

    Still, you’re very good at everything Cobb asks you to do, so you hide that. You try to reduce your performance across every task to around Erich’s level, which still seems to be moderately above what the instructor had expected. You still don’t understand why you’re finding it so easy, and that feeling seems to come across to Serri. She just gets more upset with you as the day goes on, lagging behind the two of you in every activity. Brother Cobb does his best to encourage her, but you can tell that she’s still a little below where he was expecting for the day. And with the two of you ahead of the curve instead, the gulf is pretty obvious to everyone.

    Ordinarily that wouldn’t be a huge problem - Serri’s used to getting help from you in all things magical - but she seems to really be taking it the wrong way that you accidentally lied and said you studied ahead of time without her. You’ve <em>got</em> to clear that up before the misunderstanding sticks. You just need to figure out how; do you just tell her the truth? Or would that make things worse somehow? You still don’t even know why you’re hiding all this and you really need some time to think about it!

Now that the day has passed and you’re all tuckered out from working on sensing the thing for hours at a time, you get to try to destroy it. As Brother Cobb says, this isn’t about actually killing the Mindless creature - and he doesn’t expect any of you to actually do that - rather, it’s about knowing the sensation of testing your Soul against the corruption and emerging unharmed. You have no idea what that will feel like and admittedly, you are very nervous about finding out.

    Erich, of course, is still determined to destroy it. Good for him. But as Brother Cobb explains the strategies you should use to project your Soul out towards it, you start to wonder how your unexpected talent at everything you’ve done today will translate to this, too. Will you accidentally destroy the creature without even trying? Would that expose you? What would everyone think? What should you do?

    <em>Scene 44</em>
    Well, despite your misgivings, you’re going to try your best; that’s what you should do. You’ve been suppressing yourself all day, but now... trying to do that when you’re actually touching the corruption... doesn’t exactly strike you as a good idea. So, if you somehow manage to destroy it, well, you’ll just let Brother Cobb tell you what that means. At least you’ll get to see Erich’s reacti - no, bad! You’re being nice!

    “I’ll go first.” Speak of the - well, <em>think</em> of him, at least. Erich steps forward; Brother Cobb nods.

    “Very well. Do your best and be careful.”

    He steps into the room, both full Angels following close behind.

    He places his hand on the glass. The darkness creature slams against the barrier, trying to break through and rip off the impudent limb.

    He takes a breath, steadies himself, and clenches his hand.

    “You two; take a moment to observe the Soul aspect. Watch from here, if you can.”

    There’s a flare of light and heat, like a bonfire going up. Sparks fly and burn against your skin, though of course none of this is happening in the physical world. In reality, he simply presses his hand against the glass, teeth clenched as he strains against an invisible force. The fire flares higher and brighter for a few moments until, little by little and then all at once, it wanes. Erich stumbles back, caught by one of the Angels as the other wards the beast away with a swipe of invisible light.

    “Excellent; excellent, Mr Haskell. The creature hesitated. You were able to press it back, even without any formal training. You’ve done very well today.”

    “...”

    He doesn’t respond or even look at any of you. The Angel sets him on a chair nearby to rest as Brother Cobb looks to you and Serri. “And next, we’ll have...”

    Serri looks away; she definitely doesn’t want to go next. Of course, Brother Cobb will catch on and ask you to go instead. In fact, you might as well just volunteer so she doesn’t-

    “M-me?”

    “Yes. Please go ahead. Just project as you’ve done before.”

    “...”

    Oh. She looks very small as the wolf rages against the glass; its body is probably as big as she is. The creature could rip her in half in an instant if it were free. Of course, it could probably do the same to Erich, or you, or Brother Cobb, but for some reason it’s only her you’ve got that vision of. “Brother Cobb,” you whisper. “I would have gone next.”

    “Hm? I believe Ms Ambrose will appreciate the opportunity to get it over with. You’ll get your turn shortly.”

    Maybe? At least he had a reason. Well, you’re one to talk; you haven’t been on the best terms with Serri today either. Anyway, time to get your Soul eyes open and watch.

    The flame is lower this time, angled out like a ring rather than in the clumsy but generally focused burst that Erich had produced. Like a wash of oil spilled and then ignited. The wolf snarls, growls, and slams again and again, tearing at the light spilling into its cell rather than recoiling from it. Only a few moments pass before Serri spins away from the cage, closing off her Soul again and pressing arms against her head. One of the Angels reaches down to help her away; the other stays behind to ward off the wolf, as before.

    “Very good, Ms Ambrose,” Cobb says. “The creature was certainly less than pleased. And now, Ms Goodall?”

    Well, it’s time. You walk into the room and up to the cage, pressing your hand against the glass just like the others. The wolf, ferocity undaunted, tears at the wall on the other side of your palm, merely an inch from ripping off your skin. The glass isn’t completely immobile; you can feel it vibrating ever so slightly with every impact. Oh yes, it <em>hates</em> you.

    Focus. Breathe. Open your Soul to the world, push it ever so slightly forwards, and... shove.

You’ve just jumped into a frigid, rushing river and you don’t know which way is up or down. Air escapes you in a gasp as you involuntarily exclaim in shock. You’re buffeted by the current, tumbling around in a hopeless spiral as the deadly, awful cold saps the life from you at a rapid pace. Ice crystals form on your skin and pierce into your chest, burrowing and seeking and hating and <em>hating</em> and <em>HATING!</em>

    You rip yourself away from the cage with a garbled exclamation, stumbling until you fall in a spinning heap. The same Angel from before catches you as the other wards off the wolf, except this time the wolf refuses to back off. It howls and snaps and slams against the glass again and again until finally, the second Angel pushes out his hand and the beast crumbles to dust. Silence, aside from your thundering heartbeat and unsteady breathing. Your vision is grey around the edges. You’re in danger of passing out; you know these symptoms from your illness.

    Worse than the wastelands. “It felt like I was dying,” you gasp to Brother Cobb as he rushes over as fast as he can move (not very). “I-” You cut yourself off with another choking breath; you can’t get enough air. You hold up your hand instead, asking him to give you a minute through gesture alone.

    “Jess? Jess! Are you okay? What happened?!” Serri hurries over, already recovered enough to stand and run without issue. Erich shuffles closer as well, though he doesn’t say anything. Great, now you’re dying from embarrassment as well as whatever is actually happening. Everyone else is totally fine!

    Cobb is speaking urgently to the Angel who destroyed the wolf; your ears are ringing and you can’t quite catch what he’s saying. Why is your vision still like that? Shouldn’t you be getting better by now? It’s not like anything actually happened. You just... you just... huh. You can’t quite remember.

Yes, that’s it. Can you hear me?” Brother Cobb is leaning over you. Why are you lying down? Did you fall?

    “Wh... what? I’m okay.” It takes you a few moments to put together what’s going on. “Did I... pass out? How long? What happened?”

    He sighs in relief. “Yes, you did. Less than a minute, and you’re going to be okay.”

    Someone’s holding your hand. You turn slightly to trace the arm up to Serri, who’s wiping tears away. “J-Jesssssss, I’m sorrryyyy-”

    “Huh? Sorry for what?” Erich is nowhere to be seen, but the Angel who caught you is kneeling behind your head, hand on your shoulder and humming some faintly calming tune. You can feel some sort of magic touching your Soul from that contact point, so you don’t interrupt. Presumably he’s helping you.

    “I don’t knowww; I went just before you and the wolf got all mad and maybe it’s my fault that it was so angry for you and-”

    “It’s okay, Serri.” You blink; even in your addled state you still note that he used her first name. “It’s not your fault. Jessamine-” Another blink; yours too. “-was simply more exhausted than anyone thought. She must have been working very hard on the day’s prior tasks.”

    “Is - is that all? I just... overworked myself? Again?”

    “So it seems. I apologize; perhaps in the future we should wait longer between the sensing and direct interaction practice. And perhaps the first lesson should instead be how to determine the energy left in your own Soul. You were insufficiently prepared, and that is my responsibility.”

    “Th-that’s okay...”

    “Ms Ambrose, would you mind retrieving Mr Haskell? I believe he returned to the entrance with our other escort. Please report the current situation to the Cathedra, as well. They have a line there.”

    “Er, y-yes.” She hesitantly gets up, looks at you one more time, and hurries off.

    “Very kind. Thank you.”

    You’re alone with Brother Cobb. Suddenly, the atmosphere seems far more menacing than just a minute ago.

    “Ms Goodall.”

    You flinch despite yourself. “Y-yes?”

    “Can you sit up? We should return to the others as soon as we can.”

    “O-oh.” What a relief. You thought he was about to - well, you’re not sure, but something nefarious, maybe. “Let me try...”

    You make it to standing up with a minimum of fuss, and are capable of walking on your own with no support. You feel basically fine physically, which is really weird given you had been unconscious only a few minutes ago. Still, you’ll take it over the usual side effects.

    “I have a feeling-” Cobb muses as he shuffles along the corridor. “-that this incident was due to more than simple exhaustion. Your Soul is not depleted, at least according to those who can see it. Would you mind recounting your experience by the cage? Perhaps we can puzzle out what truly caused this.”

    [This is a critical point. Two characters’ fates will be altered.]

    <em>Scene 45</em>
    You tell him. You’re really shaken up by this and don’t want to hide anything that could get you hurt. But, at the same time, you’re conscious of what happened the last time someone told him about something weird and - hey, wait a minute. You were just recently exposed to some sort of unknown Soul experiment and now you’re really good at sensing the corruption, plus you collapsed after touching it. Maybe there’s a connection there. But... you really hope Brother Cobb doesn’t see it if there is. Yara doesn’t need to get in any more trouble.

    So you stop exactly where he asked, recounting your experience by the cage, but not that you were holding back throughout most of the day. Nor what you could feel with the wastelands. You... probably need to talk to Yara about this. <em>Someone</em>, at least, and he’s both knowledgeable and trustworthy. You’ll see if he’s available when you get back.

    “I see,” Cobb says, after some time to think. “And you didn’t feel anything out of the ordinary throughout the rest of the day?”

    “W-well, not <em>really</em> - I mean, I was better than I thought I’d be at sensing it, and the wastelands felt evil, but...” You kind of trail off noncommittally, unwilling to explain that you started crying on the wall or that you purposefully didn’t do your best for most of the day.

    He doesn’t press. “Hum. Perhaps the incident early last month could be related...”

    Drat. You consider trying to talk him out of it, but that’d just make you seem more suspicious. Instead, you don’t say anything and just hope he starts considering an alternative option.

After checking that you feel okay, Brother Cobb starts another discussion to wrap up what you all learned today, but no one seems to be very focused. When you return to the Cathedra, you’re separated from the others to go right back to Illim Hall, where you’re again sat down in that cold, sterile examination room and checked over to make sure your Soul isn’t corrupted or broken or anything. You seem perfectly healthy today, unlike the last time you were here, so you’re let go without having to undergo any sort of weird procedure.

    And then you’re free on the grounds, watching the sun set and wondering if you should go find Serri or Yara or just go have dinner first. It’s been a confusing day, but it doesn’t look like you’ll have any time to process it quite yet. Because as you’re walking back to Hearth Hall to figure out what to do, someone stands up from a mostly secluded bench and walks with you.

    “Jessamine, I don’t know what to make of you.”

    Erich doesn’t look pleased. You’re not surprised by that, but you are surprised that he decided to ambush you on the way back instead of, you know, waiting at Hearth Hall. “Huh? How so?”

    “Tell me honestly, did you or did you not read those books on darkness creatures I mentioned, or indeed do any additional studying in particular?”

    “... No.” What are you going to do, flat-out lie to him?

    “Yet you were nearly as proficient as myself in many areas of Soul sensing.”

    “...” He’s just staring at you. What are you supposed to say to that? “I - er - suppose so?”

    “However, you don’t have the discipline to handle your skills. Crying on the wall, passing out in the cell; it truly paints a picture of someone handed power beyond their understanding.” A pause. “That ‘incident’ in early May?”

    A jolt. “Were you... eavesdropping?”

It doesn’t take a genius to see the connection between a Soul experiment gone wrong and a girl with more power than skill shortly afterwards.”

    He hasn’t technically said anything bad yet (well, aside from insulting you a bit), but his tone and the situation and, well, everything else is making you nervous. It almost reminds you of when one of your classmates found out why you had really been missing school, before anyone else knew. But this is different; Erich doesn’t know any more than you do. There’s no secret to expose. Sure, you’d be embarrassed if everyone knew about today’s events, but not <em>mortally.</em> “... Where are you going with this?”

    “Stop for a moment.”

    “But-”

    “I’m trying to help you. Just stand still for ten seconds.”

    “...”

    Despite your doubts, you do. Erich stands a few feet away, back turned. You start to feel a little warm, like you’re sitting by a stove.

    He turns around. “What did you feel?”

    “Warm? Did you read ahead and learn how to do temperature magic already?”

    “No. All I did was channel towards you.” He folds his arms. “And at our level, you shouldn’t have been able to feel anything unless you were already focusing on the Soul aspect. You weren’t, right?”

    “I was just standing here.”

    “Jessamine, be more invested. Do you understand what you’ve just done? <em>Unconsciously</em>, you’ve attuned to the physical and Soul aspects at once. And at a high enough sensitivity to feel a very light touch. Yes; it makes sense. You aren’t especially powerful; you’re just especially sensitive.”

    Somehow, it sounds kind of weird when he puts it like that. “You think I’m just... more, er, sensitive to...” You fumble for the words. “The Soul aspect? And that’s why the wastelands felt so evil, and why I’m so good at sensing the corruption, and why I could-couldn’t handle it when I tried to touch it?”

If you had the power to match, you would have been able to destroy the beast. I nearly had it alone, and it was therefore weakened by the time of your attempt. Now, the question remains whether this <em>is</em> due to the experiment or if it’s an innate talent, since it certainly isn’t due to practice... Have you noticed any difference in your perception over the last month?”

    You’re almost ashamed to admit it, but his explanation leaves you feeling fairly relieved. You had been worrying about some sort of imperceptible defect in your Soul that meant you were hyper-attuned to the corruption and would cause something terrible in the future. But if what he’s saying is actually true, it’s not even close to that bad. “It’s hard to tell. I’ve been improving the whole time; I don’t know if there was a difference.”

    “Of course.” A scowl. “It might be impossible to know. Perhaps if I could get a look at the schematics... But they’ve all been confiscated, of course.”

    The lights of Hearth Hall loom out of the fog nearby; you’ve almost made it back and you feel so much lighter with even the chance of an explanation that means you aren’t some sort of horrible mutant. And of course, it’s entirely plausible that Yara can actually figure it out given his knowledge of Souls and the experiment. There wasn’t anything else you had to do tonight, right?

    <em>Scene 46</em>
    ... Yes, there definitely was.

    Erich leaves when you enter Hearth Hall, heading off down the left corridor without another word. He still doesn’t look happy. Well, no matter; you’ve got to find Serri before doing anything else.

    Fortunately, she’s not hard to find; she’s waiting with Yara in the common room, surrounded by books and sheets of paper. He’s drawing something out as you enter: a glyph pattern building on the matan that doesn’t look familiar from a passing glance.

    “Ah, our prodigy returns,” Yara greets you, doing a gesture somewhere between a nod and a bow. “Hale and hearty after today’s checkup, I presume?”

    Serri isn’t meeting your eyes, but she’s obviously paying attention. “... Yeah. I’m okay.”

    “Good, good! Serri told me what happened; quite a mystery! Although I swear it sounds familiar... Is there anything you’d like to add that perhaps you haven’t shared yet?”

    Yara <em>definitely</em> knows something. That intonation on “it sounds familiar” is the one he uses when he just doesn’t want to reveal something yet. Usually for theatrical effect, but here you have a feeling there might be a different criterion. At least you were already planning on talking to her, so you’re prepared. Mostly.

    “I lied about doing extra studying. Well, not really <em>lied</em>, but... I didn’t say anything when Erich suggested it.”

    Yara nudges Serri. “See? Told you. Our dependable Jessamine wouldn’t hide that.”

    She looks up at you. “So what happened, then? Why were you so good at it? And why did you pass out?”

    “I... don’t know. It was just... easy for me to sense the corruption. B-but it seems like I’m also better than normal at sensing other Soul things - Erich tried something like that on the way back and - hey, you’re doing it right now!”

    Yara smiles, putting his hands up faux-guiltily.

    “So I think I’m just really sensitive to the Soul aspect, and that’s why trying to touch the darkness creature directly was, er, a little too much.”

Really; no extra studying?”

    “Well, no extra studying, yes, but I don’t know how ‘natural’ it is. Er, Yara, do you remember what happened about a month ago that might have... done something to me?”

    “How could I forget?”

    “S-so, do you think - I mean, it seems like it could be, er, related...?” You don’t want to accuse him of anything, so your sentence comes out lacking much conviction.

    “Hmm...” A few seconds’ pause. “Nope! Not a chance!”

    You stare at him. “Er, what?”

    “I know it seems related, since the experiment dealt with making Souls visible and we don’t know for sure what actually happened during it - although maybe if they let me <em>help</em> with the investigation, we might get somewhere-” He taps himself on the head, returning to the original thought. “But I can guarantee you, there simply wasn’t enough power in the system to do anything permanent to you. Over a month, all of the lingering effects will have definitely, 100% been flushed from your system.”

    “... How can you be sure?” Serri asks for you.

    “Soul templates, my dear! The Soul is the aspect most resistant to change of all three, and the power I used for the experiment was slightly below the published levels for even ordinary humans to resist safely. An Angel of any sort - even if she had been quite tired from suppressing her Soul all day - simply has too strong a Soul to be affected in any permanent way. Your template remained unchanged and your Soul was restored to how it should be. Likely even overnight, but after a month - not a chance!”

    “W-wait, what about that ‘knot’ that the Archangel had to heal? Wasn’t that permanent? Or it would have been?” That’s Serri again; she’s quick tonight.

My opinion is that the ‘knot’ was temporary as well, but they didn’t want to take any chances given the circumstances.” A pause; he looks at you more seriously. “Jessamine, I am entirely positive about the amount of Soul energy at play, as I provided it. My experiment did not change your Soul in any permanent way, I can personally guarantee.”

    “Which means...”

    “It’s just natural talent?” you ask incredulously. “B-but how? Why?”

    Yara shrugs. “Some people have an innately strong sense of vision, hearing, or the like. You simply have a strong sense of Soul, I suppose. Perhaps <em>too</em> strong, given what I’ve heard, but sometimes these things are just how they are. Traits from your parents, perhaps, or God’s will when you Ascended?”

    You blink, a memory from several months ago surfacing. The Calling chamber. Rosy orange light from the midmorning sun. A sense of warmth... like the warmth of a Soul, perhaps? Or, well, like the warmth of the sun and you’re overthinking it.

    “My Ascension, huh...?” You hesitate, but now that you’re thinking about it, you’re too curious not to ask. “What... were your Callings like?”

    Yara and Serri glance at each other; he shrugs and speaks first. “Uneventful, at least until I walked out of the chamber and gave the priest a real shock. I was his first Angel, you see, so the lightshow was a tad unexpected. Within the chamber, I’m afraid there’s nothing to tell; no messages from God or flashes of magical inspiration. The same as most.”

    He nods to Serri, so she goes next. “B-basically the same as Yara. Nothing happened in the chamber, then I started glowing once I left. Except my priest had done it before, so he wasn’t as surprised.”

Nothing, then a glow once I left.” A pause, you consider even saying it. But, well, that’s why you brought it up at all. “But... there was a sense of warmth in the Calling chamber. M-maybe like... like what a Soul feels like?”

    There’s a beat where neither of them say anything; you backpedal a little. “O-or maybe just what a warm room feels like. F-forget I said anything. It was just normal.”

    “Hum. I can’t say I recall any particular warmth, but of course it was quite a while ago.” He glances at Serri; she shakes her head. “Well, the Calling ceremony is where you’re supposedly touched by God if He deems you worthy. Perhaps what you felt was Him.”

    “N-no, I can’t say that; it’s got to be blasphemy or something! Only the Emissary can ever do anything like that!”

    “Well then, perhaps it was just a warm room after all. I doubt anyone can know for sure.”

    ...

    The next day, Yara is called before the same bishop as before to give more details about the experiment from May. But, as he tells you over dinner in a hopefully-exaggerated manner, Brother Cobb burst in with new evidence to prove that your sensitivity is natural and applies to more than just the corruption. You know how he got that evidence, and it was (surprisingly) Erich’s doing. He explained his hypothesis to Brother Cobb yesterday after your talk, leading to a few more tests today that meant you skipped your morning courses.

And of course, they don’t intend on revisiting their decision on Sister Bagley, even now that they’ve had to agree there wasn’t any risk of permanent damage! I may have to recruit some investigative assistance later on, if you happen to be willing.”

    Oh yes, you are.

    Erich waves off your thanks and half-refuses to acknowledge that he even helped you at all. He’s still just as prickly and you don’t really talk much outside of class. But at least you think he’s trying to be helpful when he corrects your technique or overexplains an obscure bit of theory. He doesn’t seem to be nearly as talkative with Serri, at least.

    And as for Serri... well, she isn’t mad at you, at least. But you can tell she’s still a little jealous. Magic just doesn’t come naturally for her like it does for you, and even though you do struggle with techniques outside of your natural talent in just sensing things, she struggles more. It’s not like she’s making no progress, but she has to work much harder than you or Erich to come close to keeping up. And with his constant extra studying, there’s a pretty clear 1-2-3 ranking in your course that everyone is aware of.

    You feel bad, but you can’t spend all your free time helping her. You’ve got your own practice to attend to, and your other courses are getting more complicated as well. Yara (and sometimes even Etalyn, when he asks her nicely) try to help, but they’re busy as well. Between everyone, it’s enough to keep a fragile balance in place, but you’re all stretched pretty thin.

A stable, if tenuous, equilibrium between courses, practice, and rest. You don’t think you’d be able to manage without your friends’ help, which sometimes leads you to wonder about people like Naoriel. She has to have a similar workload to yours, but she’s always shooing off people trying to get to know her. You haven’t spoken in any depth since... gosh, it must have been your first week, right? How does she manage it?

    Anyway, your routine gets an interruption one day in late July as - with her six years of training nearly complete - Clarity celebrates her 18th birthday and will soon graduate to become a full Angel.

    [Clarity will be the “main character” in this next major event (aside from you, of course), but who else should be involved?]

    <em>Scene 47</em>
    The date is August 1st and you’re back in the Lordstone Cathedral. It’s early in the morning - the fog hasn’t had time to thin yet, so there’s nothing but soft grey nothingness outside - and you’re here with all eleven other trainees, as well as several of your instructors. And the Emissary himself, of course. Thankfully, you aren’t the subject of today’s ceremony; all you have to do is stand in the right place and not mess anything up.

    “Angel Clarity Hendersen,” says the Emissary softly, eyes of gold glinting in the morning’s mechanical lamps. “Raise your head.”

    She does. He regards her for several long seconds, eyes undoubtedly focused on her Mind and Soul as well as her Body. He can do that too, you’ve learned. It’s so much less intense when you aren’t the one being scrutinized.

    “Angel Clarity Hendersen,” he repeats. “You have completed your six years of training in good standing. Your instructors have recommended you for promotion to Angel in full. Tell me, are you pure of Body, Mind, and Soul?”

    “I am.” Her voice is strong; it echoes in the cathedral. The motes of light drifting within the Lordstone shift. The rhythm of the ceremony is familiar to you; a mirror of the one you underwent just a few months ago after your Ascension.

    “Do you reaffirm your immortal, divine loyalty to the Cathedra and God above?”

    “I do.”

    “And do you promise to guide, honor, and protect the citizens of this city and this world, though it may cost you your life?”

    “I do.”

    The Emissary makes the sign of the matan, descending the steps to stand before her. “I witness and honor these oaths, sworn before our most holy relic. Rise, Angel Clarity Hendersen, and distinguish yourself as one of God’s most honored servants.”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1194477289946234953 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1194477289946234953><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, January 9, 2024 10:06 PM">10:06 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She stands. The Emissary touches her on the right shoulder, then the left, then her forehead. Body, Mind, Soul. The Lordstone flashes once, briefly, sending a short pulse trembling through everyone present. He smiles kindly and says nothing more, returning to his chair.

    Your group quickly leaves the Cathedral. Clarity herself is enveloped in a mob of other Angels, ministers, and monks all vying to offer words of congratulations or encouragement. Some of the other trainees join the crowd as well, but the ones who know her well sit back on the weathered stone benches just outside the doors. You, Yara, Serri, Etalyn, and - surprisingly - Naoriel, who’s sitting off to the side on a separate bench and pretending to be busy.

    “Ah, they grow up so fast,” Yara says, dabbing a fake tear from his eye. “Six years gone in a heartbeat. I wonder what her first mission will be?”

    All graduating Angels are given their first real mission, with actual stakes, the same day as their ceremony. As of this very moment, Clarity is now on the rotation and - once the morning bell chimes (it’s very early right now) - she will be on call. Of course, she’ll have a partner the first few times and the Center staff know which kinds of missions to assign to new Angels to minimize risks, but <em>still.</em> Real stakes. She could be dead before the day is out.

    ... You’re kind of a downer sometimes. Of course that’s not going to happen.

    “Maybe just patrols or a Blessing? You know, to ease her into it?” That’s Serri, ever the optimist.

    “I bet they’re gonna have her fight a hive of Mindless darkness. That way, every mission after will seem easy.” Etalyn often gets annoyed by Clarity.

    “What about gathering intelligence?” you offer. “She’s good at disguises and is really personable.”

    “First day’s always got combat, Jess,” Etalyn reminds you. “She’s gonna fight something.”

    “Really? Always? Can Clarity even fight?” You don’t remember her doing it much.

Body magic isn’t easy to use since you gotta be up close, but she’s mostly quick enough to pull it off. Still, kinda risky.”

    “That’s why I much prefer my strategy of bombardment at a distance,” Yara declares. “In reality, there are no rules requiring your blade-wielding opponent to start so close.”

    “‘Cept in reality, you’re gonna be fighting in people’s homes. Can’t go blowing stuff up from the next block over.”

    “Well-” He pauses. “In the wastelands, there are no homes to destroy!”

    “You wanna go out there your first time?”

    “Perhaps,” he muses. “Wouldn’t that be something? A prodigy Angel deployed immediately to the wastes. Ah, such faith; such glory!”

    “Such delusions.” Etalyn thwacks him on the arm.

    ... What is Naoriel doing here? Usually, you’d expect her to be on her way back to, well, wherever it is she spends her time, but for some reason she’s sticking around today. Does she want to talk to Clarity later? She’s pretending that she’s busy writing something in a notebook, but you’d bet almost anything that whatever she’s writing down is meaningless. The point has to be elsewhere. The point like...

    Nope, nothing happened. You were kind of hoping she’d do something, or at least look up a little, but, nope. Nothing at all for minutes on end. Well, you can’t just sit here staring at her all day; Clarity’s almost out of well-wishers and it’s time for your group to get up. You stand along with your friends and start to head over, only to notice the tall and extremely difficult-to-miss Sims brush past you on a course for Naoriel.

    He mutters something in a low voice that you can’t make out through the crowd; she shakes her head and gestures to Clarity. He sighs and says something else; she nods and hurries to catch up with your group. In fact, she notices you glancing in her direction and makes directly for you, falling into step like she hadn’t just been ignoring you for the past several minutes.

    “Oh, nothing much. I was just telling him how much I was looking forward to spending the morning with my good friend Jessamine.~”

    You blink several times at her absurdly girly tone; Naoriel’s voice has been much more reserved when you’ve spoken to her in the past. “Er, but I was-”

    “- Just as excited? How lovely; I’m so pleased to be included before morning mass!~~”

    At this point she’s actually clinging onto your arm. You have no idea what’s going on.

    <em>Scene 48</em>
    “Er, s-sure.” You may not know what’s going on, but you’re not going to pass up a chance to figure it out. Plus, you don’t like how Sims is looking at Naoriel. “I just need to talk to Clarity first.”

    “I do too!”

    “B-but you never talk to her?”

    “Today’s an exceptional day, though. You only graduate like this once!”

    And thus, she comes with you. This obviously derails whatever you were originally going to say, since Clarity is much more interested in what the two of you are doing.

    “Jess! And Naoriel; what a surprise! I know I’m supposed to be getting over to the Center soon, but come on, I can’t pass this up. What’s going on?”

    “I wish I knew,” you start to say, but are interrupted.

    “Just meeting up with Jess here for the morning. Nothing special.”

    “Oh? I didn’t know you two were such friends!” Clarity peers a little closer, as if she can’t quite believe who’s actually saying this. “You’ve always been such a loner.”

    “Well, I was for a while. But everyone’s got to break out of their shell eventually, right? Before the stakes get too high.”

    “And today is when the stakes rose?”

    “Maybe a little, but Jess actually befriended me months ago. Isn’t that right?”

    What. Is. Happening? “E-er... yes?” Maybe? If you count that brief chat in your first week, or the occasional times you’ve had lunch together since then? <em>Does</em> that count?

    “So, you see? I’ve become much more personable. You don’t have to avoid me anymore!”

    “Hmm! Good to know!”

    Every word these two are saying sounds fake, but you can’t quite tell how. Is there a code or something? But as you’re pondering, they’re finishing up their conversation and whoever’s next in line gets their turn. You’re ejected from the crowd and start heading back towards the benches where you’ll ostensibly wait for Yara and the rest.

    “Jess, didn’t we have somewhere to go after this?”

    “Huh? Oh, yeah, but I need to wait for-”

He’s facing this way, watching both of you. Naoriel grips your arm.

    “For... er, nothing, because the others know where to find us!” You awkwardly pivot on the spot and change course to head back to Hearth Hall instead, leaving Sims staring after you but not pursuing. Your heart rate is higher than you’d expect, given that literally nothing threatening has happened.

    “Seriously, what is going on?” you whisper, eyeing your surroundings like you’re going to be ambushed at any moment.

    “Hehe, no, of course not!” she responds at a normal volume. “Weren’t you listening?”

    “... ah, heheh, yeah...”

    You make it back a little earlier than planned - obviously, since you left early - and now have a few minutes before the others figure out where you’ve gone and come back as well. “I’ve, uh, got to go get my books,” you say, gesturing to the stairwell. “Since we’re, um, studying and all.”

    “Perfect! I actually think I left one of mine in your room last time; how clumsy, right? Would you mind if I came with you to look?”

    “Er... sure, that’s fine...” Maybe she’ll finally explain what’s going on if you’re out of public view. Or maybe she’ll suddenly pull a knife and stab you to death - twice! <em>Come on, pull yourself together. That’s obviously not going to happen. She’s clearly more afraid than murderous.</em> You steal another glance at her; she grins in a manner that’s probably charming to most people, but just seems weird to you given her normal expressions. <em>But then again...</em>

    You unlock the door and step inside, ushering Naoriel in after you. Close it, shoes off, down the hallway to the main area. This is about as far away as you can get from the public hallway. Your books are scattered across your desk, but neither you nor Naoriel make a move to pick any of them up. Obviously, you’re both well aware that she didn’t leave anything in your room; she’s never been here before.

    “So,” you begin. “Uh, what’s... going on?”

    “Well, that’s part of it. I also...” She grips one hand with the other and looks to the side, voice getting even quieter. “... needed to make it look like I had friends.”

    A moment passes. “You - oh, <em>that’s</em> why you needed to talk to Clarity! She’s such a gossip, the whole Cathedra will know about what you said by tomorrow!”

    Back to a more neutral pose; she smiles again, but less forced. “That’s right. And with an audience like that, hardly anyone knows either of us well enough to spot the fraud immediately.” A pause; she considers something. “I’ll just have to be careful to act like that around her and other talkative people for a while. Long enough for the impression to stick.”

    “Okay... But, erm, why? Does it have anything to do with Sims?” <em>Also, did you consider how I might feel about playing a part?</em>, you carefully only think and do not say.

    A slight wince. “Sorry, but I can’t say. And I do apologize for dragging you into this without warning; it was a last-minute plan. But... at least for a week or two, would you mind pretending to be friends?”

    <em>Scene 49</em>
    “Why... not try <em>actually</em> being friends instead?”

    “Huh? Really? I... hadn’t even considered that.”

    “You’re on a mission to look like you have friends, and actually making friends wasn’t something you had considered?”

    “... No, not really.” She half-chuckles. “I tend to overcomplicate things. But... I don’t think I can do that, sorry.”

    “Why not?”

    She hesitates. You know you’ll have to get back downstairs pretty soon, but you want to resolve this first. “You... know why. I have too many secrets I can’t share. It wouldn’t be fair to anyone.”

    “Secrets like why you need to look like you have friends? And why Sims is so interested in you? And why you went out of your way to tell me about Inquisitors when we first met?”

    “Eheheh... yes. Like those.”

    “Well... everyone has secrets,” you declare. “For instance, I know about - well, I can’t tell you; that’s the point! But...” A pause; you’re not used to being this forceful, but something about this whole situation just doesn’t sit right with you. “I’m not going to <em>pretend</em> to be your friend, but if you want to try the real thing, I’m willing to do that instead.”

    Another few seconds pass. You go pick up your books, purposefully turning your back on her to get them. “And... what would that entail?”

    You’re not sure. You’ve never tried to make a friend like this; like laying out a contract. “You don’t have to share your secrets, but I do want to know at least a little more about you. And, er, sometimes study or have food or just hang out together, or - I don’t know; just like what normal people do!”

    “So, what I was already doing this morning?”

    “But at least without the weird fake enthusiasm, please? You don’t have to force it or pretend; just be your normal self.”

    “It was a little too much, then? I didn’t have time to practice.”

    “Er, yeah. Just... don’t try to fake anything and I bet it’ll be even more convincing, if that’s what’s really important to you.”

Alright, I’ll try. I’ll just... see how it goes.”

    You’re still not sure how you feel about this, or if it was a good idea. But at the moment, you’ve got other places to be. “Okay, good. Now, er, I wasn’t kidding about studying; that’s actually what we were about to do. Working on projection theory? Do you, um, want to join us?”

    “I’m not sure I should...”

    “Oh, that’s right; you’re probably already done with projection. Maybe you could give some tips if you don’t need to study?”

    “That’s not exactly...” A pause; she considers. “Alright, I can do that.”

    And so, you return to the common area with Naoriel and surprise all three of your friends waiting there.

    “Jessamine, you seem to have brought someone with you today! Is that why you ran off so quickly?”

    “Erm... yes.”

    “So then, the elusive Naoriel Fisher. What brings you here? Aside from our dear Jessamine, of course.”

    “She invited me to join you in studying projection theory. I hope that’s alright?”

    “Oh, it’s fine with me.” Yara looks to either side to make sure neither Serri nor Etalyn have an objection either. “I’m just shocked you accepted. You’re always so distant.”

    “Well, perhaps I’m turning over a new leaf?”

    “Perhaps! So, are you familiar with the principles behind projection magic? Our two youngest Angels are working through it in their basic magic course now, though I presume you have already completed it.”

    “I’m familiar. Have you already covered channeling?”

    “Oh, yes, that was first. Now, the focus is on connections...”

    Naoriel knows her theory. Yara has more experience, for sure, but for only a second year who you couldn’t prove actually took this class, she’s very good. That’s very helpful, especially since she seems to get along well with the similarly-quiet Serri. But you also find yourself also absorbing a few new techniques that you hadn’t considered before.

Naoriel is very careful to avoid talking about herself; even something as simple as where or when she learned all this is brushed aside with a quiet comment about a course that you’re certain wasn’t running at the time.

    But you already knew she was secretive. You’re more curious about how she interacts with people who aren’t you, since you haven’t seen much of that before. She does seem to get along with Serri, possibly because the latter doesn’t pry beyond the course material. Yara, on the other hand, is probably a little too inquisitive; she tends to avoid talking to him all that much. And Etalyn... although you wouldn’t think they’d have much in common, they both seem to be pretty relaxed around each other. Have they already met? Are they already friends? Surely you would have noticed that before now, right?

    Well, you’ve already dug deep enough today; what’s one more question? Besides, Etalyn isn’t as scary as you had thought when you first met her. She’s just a little grouchy. “Hey, er, Etalyn,” you get her attention at some point towards the end of the session, when you’re both packing up. “Did you already, er, know Naoriel before today?”

    “Nope, not really. Why?”

    “No reason; you just seemed to be getting along?”

    “Hmmm.” She thinks about it for a few moments. “She’s dedicated and she’s got something to prove to someone. Kinda like me a few years ago. Maybe that’s why.”

    “Wh - huh? How did you figure that out?”

    “Look at her, Jess. She doesn’t really want to be here, but she’s doing it anyway. Do you think she actually wants to make friends? She’d have done it a while ago. So she’s doing it to prove something. Maybe a certain someone’s thinking she’s not a good enough Angel if she doesn’t.”

    “A certain someone?”

    “Lord above, Jess, you’re thick. Let me spell it out: I think she’s doing this cause her dear ol’ dad or mom or whoever told her to. ‘Cause she wouldn’t be a ‘good enough’ Angel if she didn’t make some friends. Get it? I went through the same thing a few years ago, ‘cept I just told my folks to get lost.”

    “Erm-” You’re still not quite sure how Etalyn is making her deductions, but you suppose maybe she’s seeing some evidence you’re missing because you’ve always been on good terms with your family? “That’s an interesting idea...”

    Another eye roll. “Don’t believe me if you want, Jess. You’re the one who asked for my opinion.”

    “No, no, that’s not what I meant-”

    “Yeah, yeah. I know. Now go put your stuff away or we’ll leave you behind.”

    <em>Scene 50</em>
    Naoriel attends mass and has lunch with your group before leaving to do something on her own for the afternoon with a vague promise to stop by again sometime. It’s kind of awkward - as you’d expected given that she doesn’t want to talk much. At least mass isn’t too bad; you’re supposed to be quiet for most of it. You’re still kind of confused about the whole deal, but you do at least learn a little more during lunch.

    Using the missing Clarity as a focus (she’s still either at the Center waiting for her mission, or out in the city performing it) you steer the conversation towards parents. Etalyn seems to notice what you’re doing, but doesn’t stop you - in fact, she almost seems proud. You feel a little guilty trying to manipulate Naoriel into giving up information like that, but not quite guilty enough to stop.

    It seems like the table is pretty split on how they feel about their family. You obviously have a good relationship - though you haven’t seen them in months and those occasional letters just make you lonelier - and Clarity is spoiled by her parents. Yara and Etalyn both don’t want to give any more details than you already know, but you’re aware that neither of them had great childhoods. Serri - really? You somehow never asked her before now? - anyway, Serri comes from a very large family near the outskirts, where she’s the second youngest. Apparently, many of her siblings grew up to work in some sort of farming, often in the underground caverns that wind beneath the city where they harvest plants, fungus, and the small creatures who feed on it. She’s glad she was spared having to do that.

Harvesting mushrooms from the more cultivated plots near the surface as well as descending to the less mapped caves below, hunting spiny shelled creatures and drawing new maps to be able to explore further next time. It sounds incredibly risky once you stray from the top few layers. Almost seems like something your brother would try. What did he choose for his future career path, actually? You don’t recall hearing about it in any letters recently. Maybe he’s saving it as a surprise? That doesn’t make you feel any better.

    And by the time you remember that you were supposed to be figuring out something about Naoriel, you’re all pretty much done eating and you’ve lost your chance. At least, up until good old dependable Yara steps in and asks her directly just before everyone stands up to head out.

    “Say, Naoriel, you never got a chance to talk about your family after dear Jessamine’s interest in the caverns. Is there anything you’d like to share quickly? Everyone else did.”

    “There’s nothing to tell, really. My father is an assistant deacon and I never knew my mother. I’ve been with the Cathedra for my whole life. Hardly an unusual story for any of the monks here; I was just lucky enough to be chosen to Ascend.”

Fully ordained ministers - priests and above - are heavily discouraged from having children due to various scriptural taboos that all but forbid the practice, but deacons and below are completely exempt. Therefore, young deacons on the path to becoming a priest often have children early to ensure they won’t miss out after their ordination. And if you have a kid when you become a priest, you’re fully allowed to keep them - it would be cruel to force people to choose between family and faith like that.

    And of course, growing up as a minister’s child means you’ll be involved in the Cathedra from the time you’re old enough to walk, which makes it hardly surprising that so many of them become monks. Or, apparently in Naoriel’s case, Angels. The only unusual part of her explanation is having never known her mother, but it’s not unusual enough to warrant more than a brief condolence. It’s weird; you kind of expected her to have a stranger situation.

    Unless she’s lying, of course. You glance at her suspiciously, wondering if maybe she was a little <em>too</em> ready to give that explanation? She usually never talks about herself, but here she’s completely willing?

    You shake your head. No, you can’t go around distrusting people like that. You’ll believe her, unless something comes up to change your Mind. Maybe she was just doing her best to actually be friends; you did mention wanting to learn more about her.

Etalyn has another demonstration match and Yara is going along to support her, while Serri has a training session for some sort of volunteer certification? She was a little vague about it and almost seemed embarrassed. And of course, Naoriel ran off somewhere and Clarity is busy, so that just leaves you on your own for the moment. You could probably be doing some more studying or working on that practical demonstration for your Mind course due on Monday, but you’ve got all of tomorrow to get that done. It’ll be fine.

    You end up wandering into one of the smaller shrines dotted around the campus that symbolize a particular aspect of God. There are the big three, of course - Body, Mind, Soul - but each major aspect has an assortment of minor aspects that can be drawn from it. Traits, emotions, that sort of thing.

    The shrine you’re in now is dedicated to vision, according to some metal plaques on the wall. There’s the standard Bodily vision that you do with your eyes, of course, but the shrine also offers some other interpretations. The Mental vision to see all possibilities and to know which will be effective. And the slightly different Soul’s vision to know which is the right thing to do. Then there’s also the more literal Mind and Soul vision that Angels have, but this shrine is aimed at ordinary people as well and doesn’t mention that.

    You look up at the matan symbol and make the sign with your hands, matching up your fingers’ triangle to the one on the wall. There’s no defined way to pray to God outside of the various rites and rituals that produce specific effects. If all you want is for Him to hear you, all you have to do is speak.

    <em>Scene 51</em>
    There’s no obvious answer. No flash of light or divine voice to allay your concerns and tell you everything will be okay. But you know God won’t speak to you like that; only the Emissary can hope to do something so divine. You’ll have to look for a smaller sign. Like, perhaps, that feeling of warmth from your Ascension. If that really was God’s presence, then maybe you’ll be able to feel it again?

    ... Nope, nothing. You don’t know what you were thinking. You hastily turn around, breaking the triangle formed by your hands, and hurry outside, suddenly embarrassed to be thinking so brazenly about contacting God. But when you emerge, the fog is a little different. A little clearer; the sun perhaps a little brighter. You can see the belltower you couldn’t when you went in. And while the change could have happened naturally while you were inside, that doesn’t mean it <em>did</em>. Perhaps it’s God’s will speaking to you softly, telling you that there is still light in the world, no matter how dark things may seem.

    Somehow, you feel a little better.

    ...

    Clarity is back by dinner. She’s basically fine - just a few strange, pale marks on her arms - but she’s a little shaken up, despite all her training. Without much prompting, she agrees to tell you what happened.

    The call came out before midday, about two hours before lunch. Clarity had been sitting in the Center for a while already, listening to the chatter and wondering who she’d be paired up with, when one of the operators signaled her over. A request from the tenth district, not far from the wall. Reports had come in from fishermen of strange dark shapes in the water, and one man hadn’t returned from his scheduled shift. The nearest Angels were at the wall instead of the Cathedra, of course, but coincidentally (or not!) the district was also monitoring an unusually close group of Mindless darkness gathering in the wastelands and didn’t want to leave the wall without its guardians.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1197374256544223383 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1197374256544223383><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, January 17, 2024 9:57 PM">9:57 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>So off she ran to the train station, where her partner was already waiting with a locomotive to carry them northeast as fast as technology would allow. She had been paired up with a fairly experienced Angel for her first mission, a wasteland veteran who had previously spent several years helping workers inspect, install, and maintain the heavy grates in the river that prevent any Mindless darkness from entering the city through the water. This was the fear, that one of the grates had been breached and the shapes were darkness creatures swimming through the Endle River.

    District constables met up with them at the station and quickly escorted them to the site of the man’s disappearance on the riverbank. Clarity hadn’t been fully prepared for just how many people would be involved here; dozens of constables, divers, medics, and workmen all stood back and prepared to assist as soon as the Angels declared the scene safe. Even a number of regular civilians loitered nearby despite constables shouting for them to move along, presumably caught between the situation’s danger and the chance to see Angels in action.

    With constables downstream able to confirm intact grates and no corruption just a few blocks south, the Angels decided to just start there - at the maximum possible area the darkness could have infiltrated - and proceed upstream to the wall’s grate, eliminating any corruption they found along the way. A simple plan, but an effective one - as long as any potential darkness stayed in the water. District constables had the section of river almost fully cordoned off at this point, so nothing else would be getting through without someone knowing about it, but there was always a risk something had escaped beforehand.

Her partner followed close by, letting her take the lead as you’ve heard is common in these first missions. The river water was dark, cold, and cloudy near the bottom. Muck of unidentifiable sources swirled in the relatively strong current. All that meant practically was a little bit more Soul energy expended countering it with magic, but it was “one of the most disgusting things I’ve ever done,” Clarity tells you, wiping her arms. “I’ve taken two showers since then and I still don’t feel clean.”

    The water seemed to interfere with her Soul sensing, as her partner had to get her attention and stop her from stumbling into the first creature they found. It resembled a mass of tangled-up plant matter, several gashes breaking the uneven surface and lined with sharpened bits of debris that seemed to answer for teeth. It had been busy tearing bricks out of the wall with long, slimy tendrils made of the same goopy plant matter, but it quickly noticed the two full Angels nearby and attacked.

    “That’s what these are from,” she explains, holding out her wrists for your inspection. The pale marks are about a finger’s width wide and trail up towards her elbows before fading out. “I was more worried about not getting bitten in two by its mouths, but the tendrils were dangerous too. It’s totally numb where those marks are and it’s hard to move my hands properly. See?”

    She picks up a glass successfully, but with some effort. “They told me my Body is already purging the toxins and I’ll be fine in the morning, but it was a little jarring that I couldn’t just heal it right away. Kinda scary, even though I sort of knew that might happen.”

    <em>Scene 52</em>
    “... found the missing fisherman.” She glances away. “Well, part of him. Erm... you know what, I don’t need to describe it. Just, it was really brutal, Jess. I thought I was prepared to go out there, but I’d never seen a dead man before. Not... like that, at least.”

    Thankfully, Clarity and her partner didn’t have to recover what was left of the man’s corpse; once they flagged the location and cleared another section of the river, divers were sent in behind them. Instead, they pressed on towards the wall, encountering and destroying two more darkness creatures along the way. These latter two fights went more smoothly than the first, potentially because the creatures seemed smaller and less aggressive, but potentially because her partner was more active in combat due to Clarity’s injuries.

    Eventually, they reached the outer wall to find the grates closed and intact, with no signs of any corruption having infiltrated there. That was fortunate for obvious reasons, but also unfortunate, since it meant they didn’t know where these corrupted beasts had come from. They had passed one broken grate in the river itself, so presumably the creatures had been using the river for transit within the city, but the fully functional exterior grate raised some questions. Had the monsters infiltrated through some other route and found their way into the river? Had they spawned there naturally? Or was there some other route that no one knew about?

    “The Endle River is connected to a few flooded caves under the city,” Clarity tells you as she recounts the last hour of the mission. “So some of the constables were worried there’s a passage under the walls we don’t know about and they somehow got in that way? But neither of us would have any idea how to even start looking for something like that, so we left after doing a second sweep of the river to make sure everything was cleansed.”

She’s back with you again, though Yara and Etalyn are still absent with that demonstration match.

    “I don’t know,” Clarity answers. “It was just something they were thinking about. I wasn’t really involved much at that point; my job was just to kill the darkness creatures.” She sighs. “And I’m on call again tomorrow, so I get to do it all again. Hopefully no one dies next time...”

    You don’t know what to say. Clarity’s usually so upbeat and energetic, but tonight, there’s none of that usual enthusiasm. You try to imagine what that poor fisherman might have looked like when they found him, but stop yourself quickly after realizing what a terrible idea that is with your imagination. Death will be nothing new to her in a few months - and to you in a few years - but right now, it’s still just this vague, abstract concept. Seeing someone’s Body - one of the holy three aspects - torn apart and drowned like that... Such a sudden cessation of life. You doubt even your overactive imagination is getting it right. No wonder she’s so out of it.

    “I’m glad you’re okay.” You tune back into the conversation to Serri saying that. How much did you just miss?

    “Me too. It’d be pretty embarrassing to mess up your first mission, right?”

    “That’s not exactly what I meant...”

    “But it’s true, right?”

    “Well... I guess...”

    ...

    It’s late and you can’t sleep. A lot happened today.

    You let your eyes trace lines in the darkened ceiling, just barely able to make out a few smudges of detail through the dim foggy light from the window.

    Clarity became a full Angel. She doesn’t seem all that different yet, but she’s going to be living in a different world from now on. Real missions, real stakes, real dangers. Angels are typically on call most days in a week and usually complete about one mission each day they’re on call. She’ll gain experience quickly, growing further apart from the rest of the trainees.

Is that just her life from now on until an unlucky mission gets her killed? Is that what awaits you, too? An endless parade of missions day after day until you die? Despite training to be one of them, you actually don’t know all that much about what full Angels do outside of their missions. Do they still take courses? Run experiments? Research? Are you to be a monk as well? Does that appeal to you? You’re not sure. You’ll have to ask Clarity after a while, you suppose.

    And then there’s “the Naoriel situation.” She shows up out of nowhere with Sims trailing behind, asking you to pretend to be her friend for some reason that she won’t even share. And you then decided to try and make it <em>real</em> despite that whole encounter being the least natural path to friendship you’ve ever seen. Honestly, what were you thinking? Of course she just agreed to get you to pretend without pretending. Er, that makes sense, right?

    Then there’s also Etalyn’s hypothesis. Why <em>is</em> Naoriel doing this? She doesn’t seem to want to, so is it actually due to her parents? Er, parent, as she mentioned. An assistant deacon? At Naoriel’s age, her father should have become a priest or at least a full deacon by now - especially since he raised an Angel. Maybe he had her before becoming a deacon? No, she said she’d been with the Cathedra her whole life. So why hasn’t her father been promoted after - how old is she? - thirteen years? That’s a very long time to remain at that rank.

    You shake your head, burying your face into the pillow on both sides. You’re mistrusting her again, even though you said you’d believe her! It’s just... it’s such a weird situation! What does Sims even want with her? Inquisitors? Why is she hiding so much?! Argh; you just want to <em>know!</em>

    Okay, you can’t take it. You’ll have some free time tomorrow if you can get your Mind presentation done early, and you intend to spend it figuring out Naoriel. But... how do you want to do that?

    <em>Scene 53</em>
    Finding information on Naoriel’s father doesn’t take nearly as long as when you dug up the information on Zeke’s name change, which was the last time you did something similarly stalker-like. You definitely feel a little weird, keeping an eye out in case Naoriel shows up for whatever reason, but there aren’t all that many assistant deacons (at least compared to all the data you had to sift through last time) and the Cathedra is very meticulous with its record keeping.

    The problem is then trying to cross-reference the list of potential deacons with birth records from the correct time. You don’t know Naoriel’s birthday, but you do know when she Ascended: January of last year, which is a problem. Cevember, the last month of each year, doesn’t have a Calling day unlike all twelve others. That means the children born in December, Cevember, <em>or</em> the three festival days at the end of the year are all placed into the same ceremony in January. It’s the biggest of the year for obvious reasons (and some priests are thus campaigning to add a new Calling day in Cevember), but the real issue is that you’ve got slightly more than twice as many possible birthdays to search.

    Obviously, you can’t just <em>ask</em> when her birthday is and your friends don’t know either, so there’s nothing for it but to just hunker down and -

    “Oh, Naoriel’s? December 15th. Why?”

    “Er - wait, huh? How do you know that?”

    Clarity winks. “It’s my job to know things! But if you must know...” She lowers her voice and flattens her tone. “I painstakingly searched through every official birth record in December and would have done Cevember and the festival days too, but got lucky to find it before then.”

    “... Really?” You were about to do the same thing, so you suppose it isn’t out of the question, but still; that’s a monumental amount of work!

I can’t live up to my title as chief gossip without putting in the legwork every now and then! Plus, a few other people were curious too and helped me out. It’s a good thing I don’t have to do that for <em>every</em> new Angel, though. Right, Ms February 20th?”

    You had just told her your birthday when she asked. “Y-yeah.”

    “So, why are you interested? Planning a party several months in advance?”

    “Er...” You don’t particularly want to lie to Clarity, but you also don’t want to broadcast what you’re doing to the entire Cathedra. You might want to know what’s going on with Naoriel, but you don’t want to reveal her secrets to <em>everyone.</em> And that’s if you even succeed. “Yeah... That’s right.”

    Clarity squints at you. “C’mon Jess, you need to try harder than that. No one’s going to believe you with that kind of conviction.”

    “Uh-”

    “Look, if you want to sell a lie, you need confidence! Like how you totally believed I spent all that time looking through birth records earlier!”

    “Wait, you didn’t?”

    “Hehe! No, that was true, but imagine if it wasn’t!”

    “Erm...” Now you’re just confused.

    “Anyway, here, let’s start with the color of this pencil. Alright, go ahead and tell me it’s green...”

    Somehow, you end up getting a lesson in lying from Clarity. She doesn’t ask again what you’re trying to find out with Naoriel’s birthday. For as hyper as she can be sometimes, she’s usually dependable when it counts.

    Anyway, armed with the correct date, it only takes you a few more days to find the one with the right name. There’s only one Naoriel Fisher who was born on that date, as you’d expect, though it’s a little surprising that she was born with her given “-riel” name - it wasn’t a change later. Especially for a deacon; you’d think he would be more respectful of the original Angels. Well, you suppose it’s just a tradition and not anything actually scriptural. Just a little weird.

Her father’s name is Columbus Fisher and he’s listed as an assistant deacon in the eleventh district. The church is fairly small and unimportant, kind of far away from anything of note aside from a small rail station that only sees four trains a day. At that frequency, it’d usually be faster to just walk to or from one of the nearest hub stations that see dozens or more.

    But as you dig further into him and his career over the course of the week - trying your best to not let anything slip to Naoriel when she does in fact show up every so often as promised - some pieces don’t quite add up. This man became an assistant deacon about fourteen years ago, just before Naoriel was born, but there aren’t any particular records about him before or since. You might just be missing anything before - most people don’t leave much of a paper trail as a child unless they’re exceptional - but afterwards, you would expect to see some news articles mentioning him at the church. Some awards or published sermons. Research or other work. Anything? And, as you had previously noted, he remained an assistant deacon for fourteen years, never moving up in the clergy.

    Maybe he’s just very unambitious? Piously comfortable in his lesser role supporting those around him but never in the spotlight himself? That kind of fits with how Naoriel behaves (sorta?) but it certainly wouldn’t make any sense with Etalyn’s hypothesis. She could be wrong, of course, but it’s still weird. The priest has changed twice in that time, and a number of other deacons were hired and promoted. Mr Fisher (not Father; only ordained clergy get new titles) is by far the most senior member of the staff there, and you can’t find a single mention of him outside of the Cathedra’s records.

Naoriel’s father seems just as confusing as Naoriel herself. Is he a secluded, extremely private man like his daughter who actually is just content where he is? Or is there something else going on?

    You’re actually midway through checking the calendar to see when the next time you’re allowed to leave the campus is before you slow down and get a grip on yourself. <em>I’m literally stalking this poor girl,</em> you realize. <em>What am I hoping to do by visiting her father besides creeping both of them out and probably ruining any relationship I have with her? It’s such a dumb idea; I bet I won’t even find anything useful. And... it’s just a really, really weird thing to do!</em>

    And yet...

    Next Friday, August 14th, is Randolph Endle Day. The holiday celebrates exactly who you’d expect: the man who first invented practical steam power, utilizing the river that now bears his name because of it. But beyond that, you’re allowed to leave campus on holidays. You eye the train schedule amidst the horrifyingly large pile of documents you’ve gathered around yourself. It’s totally feasible. You could go.

    But should you?

    <em>Scene 54</em>
    ... No! Absolutely not; what were you thinking?! You’re starting to let your investigation get in the way of common sense and basic decency. Time to drop it for a while and calm down. Make sure you can still make rational decisions. But making <em>that</em> decision means your Endle Day is free, since Brother Cobb promised to stop scheduling things on holidays for a while and no one has invited you to do anything yet.

    Which means...

    You drop off the letter at the clerk’s desk directly instead of at a drop box, asking her to please ensure it gets out today. Of course, your request is treated as a semi-divine command by many ordinary staff (at times, despite your protests), so you have no doubt it will. You’ve finally got a chance to see your family again for the first time since March, more than five long months ago, and you’re not going to squander it. You’re going out next Friday, no matter what.

    Now, you’ve just got to find someone to help you maintain a disguise while out and about. And, since you were pondering this earlier when thinking about being a total creep, you’ve already got someone in Mind.

    “Ah, my apologies, but I’ll be busy that day,” Yara says, spinning a pencil between his fingers before setting it down. “I’m to assist Ets with something.”

    “Don’t tell me it’s another demonstration match?” you ask. “She’s had one the last... three holidays; what more is there to demonstrate?!”

    “Ha! As much as she’d probably enjoy that, not this time.”

    “So... what is it?”

    Suspiciously, Yara pauses for several seconds before responding. “Nothing in particular. Just a few errands in the city.”

    You squint at him just like Clarity, to make sure he knows you don’t believe him. “You suuurreee?”

    “What is this, an interrogation?”

    “A-anyway, have you checked with Clarity yet? I’m sure she’d be happy to help you.” He waves your accusation away and you reluctantly drop it. You don’t want to be mean.

    “She’s on call, so she can’t be away from the Cathedra. I asked her at dinner.”

    “Hmm. Is there anyone else who could...” He considers it. “Let’s see. Clarity and I could, but we’re both busy. Etalyn’s also busy, but she can’t hold an external transmutation for long anyway. Erm... Serri... unfortunately not. Ah, what about Denn?”

    “I... just think it’d be a little awkward,” you mumble. “I still don’t know him very well.”

    Yara laughs. “Good to see the old Jessamine is still in there somewhere. You’ve gotten so confident lately, I wasn’t sure!” Another pause.

    “I - I can ask Denn; it’s not-”

    “Ah! Do you actually need to be disguised the whole time? I could give you a charge in the morning and stop by to do another in the evening; as long as you aren’t in public for the day, it should be fine. But if you do intend to head into the city proper, I’m afraid you’ll need to be brave and risk talking to our dear Mr Ayburn.”

    Another pause; he raises an eyebrow. “Or I suppose you could wrap a scarf around your face so no one can see you. Might be a little tough to explain at this time of year, though.”

    “How would I see where I’m going?”

    “Ah, I forgot to mention the other benefit: it’s an excellent opportunity to practice your non-physical senses! Make out your surroundings by sensing Minds and Souls! What a bargain!”

    “I think I’ll pass, thanks.”

    “So, would you like to go the there-and-back route, or ask Denn to come along?”

    “Well...”

You could just spend the day at your house with the shades drawn, but you wouldn’t exactly be incognito given that all your neighbors already know the Goodall family’s daughter is an Angel. Since, you know, they were there when you Ascended. But going out into the city could present similar problems. When you’re disguised, you still look like yourself, and you’d be with Seth and your parents. Anyone who knows any of you would pretty quickly be able to put two and two together and figure out who you are.

    But what’s the alternative, then? Even if you disguised yourself as someone other than yourself (not something you’re particularly keen to do for your first reunion with your family in months) it’d still be pretty obvious who you are with the rest of your family there, and then you’d also be revealing disguise magic to the general public! That could get you in serious trouble!

    Maybe... maybe you’re overthinking things. Sure, people who know your family will be able to figure out who you are, but you can’t really stop that. Is the point of disguising yourself really to hide your identity, or just to avoid causing a commotion by looking like a full-on Angel when out and about? Probably the latter? Hopefully the latter.

    So, what will you - wait, Yara is literally right in front of you. You quickly summarize most of what you just thought about and are relieved to hear that you’re pretty much correct: your disguises are meant to avoid having full Angels just wandering around the city, not necessarily to go fully incognito. If someone who knew you before your Ascension recognizes you while disguised, that’s fine as long as they don’t cause a scene.

    <em>Scene 55</em>
    “Well...”

    Nothing else of particular note happens that week. Clarity goes on more missions and shares more harrowing tales of fights against the corruption all across the city, but also tales of the impacts her efforts have on the people you’re collectively sworn to protect. Not every story ends with a dead fisherman torn apart in the river; many more times, the Angels arrive in time to prevent any serious harm.

    Naoriel shows up at unpredictable times, continuing in her quest to pretend to be your friend. Still, you keep learning just by hanging around with her, even if you’re trying your best to avoid actively stalking her. That white beret she wears isn’t part of the dress code, much like Clarity’s pin, but since it kinda looks like it could be, no one really bothers her about it. Apparently she had been self-conscious about her hair sticking up before becoming an Angel, and just kept the habit of wearing it even though her appearance is now flawless.

    You find it a little weird that the Body transformation considered her cowlick to be a “flaw” to correct and spend some time discussing what a “perfect Body” actually means and what determines it. Turns out there’s actually some literature on the subject, but (as with quite a lot of magic’s fundamental behaviors) the best explanation anyone can come up with is “it’s God’s will.” God, so it seems, prefers smooth hair.

    Finally, Friday morning arrives. You now have two non-uniform outfits to choose from (courtesy of Clarity, of course), and decide on the less-fancy one to avoid giving too much of a shock. Just a simple full-length cream dress with some darker accents to stop barely short of “too plain.” This sort of rougher, simpler outfit is what many ordinary people in the city wear, and is familiar to you from your childhood. But somehow, you feel less natural in it than you expected.

The you in the mirror just... seems to fit it better than the simple outfit.

    This discovery does not help with your nervousness. You were already worried you might have changed more than you realized and wouldn’t fit in with your family again, but now you don’t even seem natural in the sort of clothes you had worn just a few months back? Maybe you’re overthinking it; maybe you should swap back anyway. Agh! Why are you so indecisive?

    You dig through your belongings to find a coin (a leftover from one of your previous outings) and just give it a flip to decide for you. It lands tails, which means... ah! You forgot to assign outcomes to the sides before you flipped it! Okay, okay, do it again... tails, a second time. That means you don’t change back, staying in the fancier outfit. You suppose your actual Body’s changes will be far more of a surprise than any clothes you could pick out. Okay, gather a few more things and you’re ready. Double check the ribbon on the way out to make sure - you did it wrong again! Okay, you’ve got to fix that this time; it’ll be way more obvious when you’re disguised...

    Several minutes later, you finally arrive downstairs to meet up with Yara and Etalyn, who have clearly been waiting for some time already. They’re both in relatively modest outfits - Yara’s looks like Denn’s banker-ish outfit, though a little more colorful, while Etalyn has a similarly light shirt but darker blue waist-high overalls. You suppose you didn’t expect her to wear a dress, really, but it would have been interesting to see.

    “Minor problem, Jessamine,” Yara admits once they’ve finished ribbing you for being late. “It seems I’m not nearly as good at external transmutations as I thought; my testing with Ets here only lasted twenty minutes, give or take.”

    “So we’ll just have to come with you to your station, instead of splitting up at the departure one here. It’s less than a twenty minute walk to your home from there, yes?”

    Phew. “Y-yeah. About fifteen.”

    “Hmm. Might be a little tight; I’m not certain if you’ll be as receptive to my magic. We’ll test on the way.”

    “Don’t word it like that,” Etalyn grumbles.

    “How would you have me say it? That I’m quite capable of enchanting you?”

    “Worse. Try again.”

    “Hmm...”

    You pass through the perimeter without issue and walk to the central station, passing by the Cathedra’s own station just in time to watch a single-car train depart with rapid acceleration. There aren’t actually many scheduled routes from it; most of its activity comes from the ad-hoc trains transporting Angels to their missions. For useful civilian routes, it’s usually easier to walk the extra few blocks to downtown proper.

    On arrival, you all buy your tickets using extra money Clarity had given you previously for exactly this purpose, wait a few minutes by the tracks, and rapidly set off to the sixth district.

    You can’t help but compare this ride to the one you took in the opposite direction half a year ago. Then, a private car nonstop to the Cathedra. Now, a full train making every stop along the way. You pass over the Endle River bridge and take a moment to stare into the dull grey water. Even now, in the sunny heat of late summer, the fog prevents any sparkling waves. The water looks as it always does.

    Although now you know the kind of monsters that could be lurking within it.

    “G-got it.”

    Etalyn saunters back over, pointing over her shoulder at a nearby platform. “Our train’s boarding. Hurry it up.”

    “Goodness, already? What fortuitous timing! We’ll return this evening as promised; do enjoy your Endle Day.”

    “Yeah, have fun, Jess. Lucky to have a family like you do. Appreciate ‘em.”

    “I - I will.”

    Etalyn smirks and rolls her eyes, heading off to the train she indicated. Yara grabs your arm, recharging your disguise, then waves farewell and hurries off after her. “See you tonight!”

    You don’t have any time to waste. You wave just once, then spin around and walk out of the station.

    [It’s really happening. How are you going to greet your family?]
    ⏱️ - Like nothing’s changed.

    <em>Scene 56</em>
    The streets are familiar here. You rarely walked to the station itself from your house, but it’s surrounded by the neighborhood’s main commercial zone, not to mention your school. You know the area well.

    Unfortunately, you don’t have time to sightsee. You can’t sense the disguise degrading as anything more than a vague “cooling off” of the warm blanket-like feeling, so you’re not sure exactly how long you have or at what point it will slip away entirely. Streets pass by in rapid succession as you fall back into your well-memorized route back home. Some of the signs are different; businesses have changed or moved. Homes have new shutters or doors. Life, so it seems, went on.

    But... somehow, even these little changes make everything seem so different. You’re used to modern, sleek skyscrapers and traditional, ornate cathedrals now. The shabby wooden townhomes and rough streetsigns belong to a different world. One occupied by ordinary people, not Angels.

    You’re discomforted by these thoughts. They don’t feel like something you’d think, right? You’re still human; you’ve only been gone for less than half a year! This neighborhood is just as much your home as the Cathedra; more so, even. Where’s this vague sense of... separation coming from?

    There’s no answer to find as you continue on, winding out of the main streets and into the narrower residential alleys that make up the bulk of the district. The charred-black face of a building catches your eye and you think back to one of the few times you had seen an Angel outside of district assemblies. A townhome down the street had caught fire and, with narrow alleys surrounded by old wood on all sides, it quickly began to outspread any attempts to keep it contained.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1200945468469952592 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1200945468469952592><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, January 27, 2024 6:28 PM">6:28 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>This is one of the main dangers in a city as dense as Nucarreo. There’s simply no way to move vast quantities of water to a large fire fast enough to douse it, not with so much fuel around. Trains can carry huge pumps and tanks, but the rails don’t go everywhere and hoses can only stretch so far. If the fire is far from a station (or even a stretch of track where a tanker train can park) carriages, carts, or just plain buckets are the only way to move water. But tanks get stuck in narrow alleys, horses are unwilling to approach the flames, and simple buckets can’t handle enough volume. Some forward-thinking gearworkers have put forth ideas to tap into the water pipes running beneath the streets, but so far that remains only an idea.

    So Angels appear instead.

    Magic. You had stood in the alleyway that night, watching as winged, glowing forms swooped around the inferno and slowly, carefully pressed it back. Not with water or by smothering, but simply by their very presence. Wherever these Angels went, the fire died. Before the hour was out, they had contained it enough that ordinary firefighters could isolate the remaining embers and let it burn itself out.

    Now, you understand that these Angels must have used some form of external physical projection to absorb or redirect the flames’ energy. Or potentially transmutation to transform the wood into something that couldn’t burn? No, that wouldn’t make sense; transmutation is so much more energy-intensive and would have required physical contact. It must have been projection. But though you understand the principles, the concept of <em>you</em> doing something like that just seems so far away. The immense control and focus it would require while flying around to keep yourself and civilians out of harm’s way as well...

    You’re here.

You hesitate a little longer, eyeing the tiny scratches and imperfections on the windows while trying to gather the courage to knock. What are you going to say? How should you act? So much has changed, and it’s been so long!

    Briefly, you even consider giving up and fleeing back to the station, but get yourself under control again quickly. Not only would you not make it back before your disguise falls apart, but you’ve been wanting this for months. You have to.

    Just raise your hand.

    And.

    Knock.

    “Just a moment!” you hear someone call from inside. It’s your dad. Of course you still know his voice.

    You wait on the step, fidgeting with your clothes and hands, for several uneasy seconds. You still don’t know what you’re going to say. “Hi?” Sure (maybe?) but what then? Do you talk about the Cathedra? Your future? Seth’s future? Oh, that might be good; you really want to know what he picked. But how would you even-

    He opens the door. Even though you’ve been waiting for this for the past few seconds - hours - months - you’re still caught off guard. Frozen.

    “Jessamine,” he breathes, kneeling down to embrace you. “You’re back...”

    “H-hi, dad.” That’s the best you can do. You hug him back, but something isn’t right. It’s exactly what you imagined, except for...

    Oh no. No, no no. The feeling of alienation from the streets and buildings had been just a worrying prelude. You still feel fond of your dad, but... there’s no <em>connection.</em> You don’t... you don’t <em>love</em> him like you used to.

    <em>Scene 57</em>
    At first, no one thinks that’s weird. You’re still young and just reunited with your family that you haven’t seen for months; plenty of people would cry in a situation like that. But after you calm down a bit and try to explain what you’re feeling (doing a very poor job of it, you can tell), mom sits you down on the nice chair and tries to help you figure it out.

    The adjectives you provide don’t seem to make them understand. Disconnected, confused, a little empty. It’s natural to feel a little isolated after being away for so long, you’re told. You’ve been living in a different world since you left. Of course you’d feel a little different as well, and that’s okay. They’re here for you anyway.

    You’re not so sure. It just feels so sudden; surely you haven’t changed <em>that</em> much. There exists magic that can manipulate your Mind and emotions. Corruption can cause thoughts and feelings to decay. It just... it’s gotta be something <em>external</em>, right? Something that means it isn’t your fault for losing how you feel about your family. Something that can be fixed. Otherwise...

    At some point you realize your disguise fell apart and no one even said anything, even though you can tell the changes are surprising. Surely at least Seth has to be curious about that, but he’s not saying anything because you’re still a mess and he has to take care of you again just like he did for years when you were younger and even after your sickness passed he still had to protect you at school and you’re just the <em>worst</em> and why can’t you pull yourself together? It’s so <em>stupid</em> to just be sitting here all sad about nothing!

    You really should be better at controlling your emotions than this, after these months of Mind training. That thought leaps into your head unbidden, which of course only makes you feel worse.

You don’t suddenly find some weird spell squatting on your Mind and toss it aside to reveal those hidden emotions.

Dad heads over to help with the trays and Seth gets distracted for a moment by something loud happening outside, popping over to look before declaring it just a rattly cart. <em>That</em>, finally, feels normal.

    You still feel kinda weird, but not enough to ruin anything. It’s good enough. It’ll have to be good enough, because you don’t have all day. Yara and Etalyn will be returning “this evening” at some point, without a concrete time decided because you were just too frantic to think of it, so you’ve only got... you’re not sure. Until the sun sets, maybe? But you’ve gotta make the most of it!

    So you have some cookies and explain what you’ve been doing for the past five and a half months. The courses you’ve taken, the friends you’ve made, the magic you can do. You’re still not very good, but at this point Brother Cobb has had you practice changing your Soul’s resonance phase and basic projection. It’s enough to let you create momentary jolts of pressure in the air near you, causing sudden breezes. Certainly not very spectacular compared to what full Angels can do (or even trainees like Yara), but it’s <em>real magic.</em> Seth is impressed.

    You keep some stuff to yourself, of course. The incident with Sister Bagley, for one. Details from Clarity’s missions. That one time you collapsed at the outer wall. The sort of things that would make them worry about you. It’s better to keep up the facade that Angels are glorious, perfect beings and that you don’t have anything to fear. There’s nothing they can do at this point, anyway; worrying would be a waste of effort.

    So. You’re caught up, mostly. It’s taken a while, but you’ve still got plenty of time left. What now?

    <em>Scene 58</em>
    Well, you’ve got to know what your brother plans on doing for his future job. While the choices made after one’s Calling aren’t completely permanent by design - you are just twelve when it happens, after all - most kids do stick with theirs. The idea is that God inspires you during your ceremony so that, even if you don’t Ascend to be an Angel, you still get an idea of what His plan for you might be. Seth has kind of been avoiding the topic in your letters and there’s really no better time to find out. So you ask.

    “...”

    You should have guessed. He’s taking advanced combat, tactics, and survival classes - not to mention extra training on the corruption he’ll start in two years’ time. Your brother is intending to become a wasteland soldier.

    You think back to the four men in soldiers’ fatigues who saluted you just after your Ascension. The warriors you met guarding the wall and the strange, bunker-like building that (at times) houses captured darkness creatures. They’re strong, hardy people, a job granted only to the toughest and most pious of men - at least, of those who were not picked to join the Cathedra in a divine capacity.

    But they’re only human, after all, and they don’t have an Angel’s blessings. Well, they do carry an Angel’s Blessings, but - nevermind. The point is that they’re far more mortal than any Angel.

    You recall Zeke’s stories of his encounters with shades, and how any encounter without losing a member of the squad is considered a great victory. Descriptions of dangerous, desperate work repairing tracks or equipment as men fight and die to provide the time to do so. Of Angels too busy or too slow to save the men under their command as they succumb to darkness just feet away.

    “...”

    Right, of course he’d notice your expression. What’s wrong? Can you even tell him? Obviously, he wants to do this for you. If his sister has to be out in the wastelands fighting against the darkness, then by God he will be too.

Simpler things; even ordinary civilians know that soldiers have it rough. The wastelands take their toll, even with consistent healing from the Angels they accompany. The corruption still degrades your Soul, even if only a little, and the effects are magnified on the Mind and again on the Body. Soldiers rarely have the chance to grow old; even when they survive to retirement, incurable diseases often cut their lives short. The Body turns against itself, you’ve heard.

    Seth isn’t dissuaded. It’s worth it, he declares, to protect you and everyone else in the city. You’re reminded of your own oath, the one taken with death seeming so distant. To lay down your life for Nucarreo, should you have to. Soldiers make a similar promise. Would trying to stop him be hypocrisy? Your Mind whirls, spinning through the possibilities and snapshots of the future. It’s hard to focus on what anyone else is saying.

    Your parents are apprehensive as well. How could they not be, with both of their children pursuing the most dangerous and important jobs in the city? You didn’t have a choice, and becoming an Angel comes with incredible benefits and powers to defend yourself. But Seth...

    And yet, neither one of them voices a serious objection. He’s been thinking about this for months, ever since his Calling. God Himself made His plans known in that chamber; he’s sure of it. And no matter how worried a parent might be, one can never go against God. If He wills it, then His plan will keep Seth safe. Or, at least, His Angels will.

You’d never be able to forgive yourself if your brother...

    Nope, not even going to finish the thought. In case it comes true.

    ...

    The sun has dipped beneath the horizon and the fog is tinged with a fading orange as shadows overtake the light. You don’t know where the last hours have gone; the day is a blur. Even though it should have been a relief or a vacation, you’ve held nothing but a building anxiety since the morning. Even now, you wouldn’t be able to reproduce a single sentence uttered by anyone since you arrived; only the broad impressions. It feels like you’ve wasted the day, and you can’t even figure out how or why. What went wrong? Nothing, and yet...

    A knock at the door. You jolt, having been unconsciously on edge and listening for it. You told your family that some other Angels would be arriving to pick you up, right? God, you can’t remember. What’s wrong with you?

    <em>Scene 59</em>
    Well, there’s nothing wrong with letting your dad answer the door again even if you forgot to mention it. His appearance will be expected for anyone knocking, whereas yours (you belatedly realize) is still Angelic and could cause problems if it’s actually not who you expect.

    But it is. You overhear Yara giving a brief outline of what he’s here to do and your dad thanking them for looking out for you. So you did talk about them, at least to some degree. Well, you should probably get up and head over there. Just be careful to stay out of sight of the doorway unless they’ve closed it.

    The farewells pass in the same blur as the rest of the day. You get three more hugs and some quiet goodbyes, then a pulse of magic from Yara and... out you go. Your emotions remain a mystery; there’s some of the bittersweet sorrow in there that you would expect, but if you’re being honest with yourself... there’s some relief in there as well. You hate that; it doesn’t make sense. You absolutely cannot have changed so drastically in the past few months for that reaction to be natural. There <em>has</em> to be something wrong. You can feel it. You just don’t know <em>what</em> it is.

    Streets, station, platform, train. You start to feel a little more normal by the time you’ve made it into your seat - packed again due to all the people with the day off to go traveling. Start to be able to pay a little more attention to your surroundings. Yara’s saying something. You can listen now, right?

    “<em>There</em> you are, Jessamine. You can hear me now, yes?”

    “... Yeah. Sorry.”

    “Goodness, you were in quite a state. One-word answers to anything we asked you; not really focusing on anything around. Did... everything go alright at home?”

    “...” You’re not sure. You can’t remember the details. “F-fine. It was good to be with them again, even just for a day. And... thanks for helping make it happen.”

    A gracious nod. “If that’s the case, then what was the matter?”

Shrouded in fog, the visibility is so low that - from your elevated train - you can’t see the ground. Just diffuse clouds of light from the streetlamps and buildings below. You could be flying in the mist above, the lamps as stars. You’ve still never seen the true night sky, above the fog. “I don’t know. Nothing went wrong; it was just like I wanted. But somehow... it just didn’t feel right. I didn’t... t-there wasn’t a <em>connection.</em> It was like we were strangers, or just friends instead of family... Did that... happen to you?”

    He and Etalyn glance at each other. “Ah, Jessamine, this is how we know you aren’t feeling well. You never would have forgotten such a detail otherwise.”

    “Both of us hate our families,” Etalyn helpfully (bluntly) clarifies. “So, no, not much chance of that happening for us.”

    “Ah, er - right. I... knew that. Sorry.” You did; you’re just a little mixed up at the moment.

    “Anyway, you’ve been away from your family for the longest time you ever have, and during a period of very significant change in your life. I suppose it’s no wonder you may have felt distant. Jessamine the normal girl may have been thrilled to return, but Jessamine the Angel may have never met them before. Something like that, perhaps?”

    “That makes it sound like I’m two different people...”

    “Well... Not physically, at least, but you have changed a great deal since you arrived at the Cathedra. Grown more confident, more skilled, more... opinionated at times. You aren’t the same person as the one who knelt in the Ascension chamber.”

    “... You really think that’s all it is? Just normal growth and change?”

    “What else could it be?”

    “I don’t know,” you grumble, leaning against the window. “Something else.”

Clearly, they don’t believe you. Which makes sense, because you don’t have an alternate explanation. All you have is a feeling that it isn’t right; that you shouldn’t have been feeling those emotions. You’ll have to figure it out later. You’re not giving up just because you don’t know what’s going on; just add it to the pile of other things to investigate.

    “By the way,” you eventually continue, changing the subject. “What did you two get up to today?”

    “Ah, just errands. Nothing exciting.”

    “That’s what you said this morning. Nothing interesting at all happened the whole day?”

    They look at each other again. “Nope.”

    “...”

    “...”

    “Okayyyyyy.” You do the squint again. You don’t believe them for a second.

    You dream of distance that night. Endless voids of empty space, fog whispering around you with the voices of your friends and family. You forgot about them. You left them behind. You don’t need them anymore, is that it? How disgusting. How sickening. To just abandon those who care about you like that.

    Flat planes of vague white nothing. Grey fog curling around you. Within you. Every breath you take inhales more of that horrible, writhing mist that now echoes with quiet rebukes from inside your Body. You try to stop breathing, but you can’t. Holding your breath only works for so long, and then you have to gulp in another even larger lungful of the tainted, guilt-laden air. What could you have done differently? It wasn’t your choice to ignore them; to leave them behind. You didn’t even do that, right? You came back. You visited. You <em>tried!</em>

    It doesn’t have to be something you did for it to be your fault. You are responsible nonetheless. Trying to avoid the duties placed upon you is the way of a coward and a traitor to those who depend on you. Who care about you. Even now, as you push them away, they still care. You’re hurting them. What are you going to do about it?

    But those assurances ring hollow against the fading voices of those crying out from the dream’s insubstantial abyss.

    Breathe. Control yourself. It’s not real. It’s Sulday; you don’t have courses. There’s mass and homework, but that’s okay. You can recover. You just need something to occupy yourself.

    <em>Scene 60</em>
    So, of course, you pick one of the least accessible topics in the Cathedra for your next obsession.

    Inquisitors. You understand generally what they do - hunt down any corruption (or Corruption) in the Cathedra itself and... dispose of it - but you don’t really know anything beyond that basic overview. There have been Inquisitors involved in a number of recent events and you have a feeling some of them may be getting a little interested in you. Zeke - and Sims; you’re almost certain he’s training to become one later - for a few, but sometimes full Angels seem to be watching you when you’re out and about. Not enough to seem objectively creepy, but just... enough to be disconcerting.

    You start with the library, but predictably any information on Inquisitors beyond the surface level or passing mentions in other texts has been restricted. You do learn a few interesting things about the Cathedra’s hierarchy here, though, so it’s not a total loss.

    Inquisitors do not report to bishops or archbishops like ordinary Angels. Instead, they are considered to have a rank roughly analogous to Archangels, though somewhat outside of the typical structure. Instead, Inquisitors report directly to the prime council or, in rare cases, the Emissary himself. You’ve heard of the prime council, but (just like Inquisitors) don’t know much beyond the basics. So you do some studying.

The council is handpicked by the Emissary and traditionally consists of nine members (three times three, so twice as holy, you suppose. Thrice?) The primes are collectively responsible for the Cathedra’s overall direction and governance, with each typically focusing on a specific facet as well as the whole. This is relevant to you for a multitude of reasons (including that they elect the Emissary), but today, primarily because one of the primes is in charge of Inquisition and is thus considered head of the Inquisitors, despite not being an Angel at all.

    Ranking and official positions get fuzzy near the top, you note, frowning at all the “traditionally” and “typically” and other words that indicate most of this structure is due to centuries of precedent rather than any official rules or scripture.

    Unfortunately, there’s not much more to find in the library unless you have a sponsor - which you definitely do not - so you try asking Naoriel next. Discreetly, since you’ve learned by now that she’s a little nervous about Inquisitors and related topics. You suppose that’s reasonable, given that Zeke and Sims are still keeping their eyes on her despite nothing of note really happening for months.

    You have now officially been friends with her for almost a month, during which time you’ve both gotten slightly less awkward around each other, so that surely means she won’t be too worried about sharing some information, right? No, you know better than that. Naoriel doesn’t like giving up secrets, so in all likelihood she’s going to say...

    “Sure. What do you want to know?”

    “What, really?”

    “Should I change my Mind?”

    “No - no, this is fine. Just a little unexpected!”

    She shrugs, poking at a loose thread in the jacket she’s repairing. For once, you’re ahead on your work and don’t have anything better to do than hang out and distract her.

I guess to start with, is there anything different about an Inquisitor? You know, from a regular Angel?”

    “Nope. They just have a different position and extra responsibilities. Nothing physically different. Like Archangels in that way, except most of those have wings.”

    You expected as much, but it always pays to make sure. “Okay, so how are they recruited? You can’t just apply to be one.”

    “Usually they’re scouted by existing Inquisitors. I’ve heard they tend to look for Angels with a strong sense of ‘justice,’ good investigation skills, and who aren’t super obvious.”

    “I could literally hear the quote marks around ‘justice’ there.”

    She drives a pin into the cloth with a little more force than strictly necessary. “They <em>say</em> it’s ‘justice,’ but really they’re just looking for people who like enforcing rules. If it’s the rules you enforce that decide how just you are, I don’t think you yourself can possibly <em>be</em> just. You’re just a middleman, I suppose. Just a just middleman... but just of ‘justice.’ Hmm.”

    “What?”

    “Ignore me.” She says that a lot.

    “Okay...” You think for a moment, trying to work through her sentences. Except the last one, probably. “So are their rules just?”

    “They can be.” A few deft stitches and she starts pulling pins. Naoriel is surprisingly good at sewing, though you’d be hard pressed to explain exactly why you find that surprising. Maybe just that she’d bother at all when the normal staff will do it for you. “But it depends on the primes. I’m sure you’ve done your background research before asking me, so you know about them. Right?”

    “Yeah. A little.”

What about the other kind of corruption? You, as a prime, have almost unlimited authority to do pretty much whatever you want as long as the other primes don’t object. And they usually don’t, because even primes aren’t above Inquisition either. No one can be, or the system doesn’t work. So, you need to decide how to deal with all the findings your Inquisitors report up to you. Does a priest accepting untracked donations count as corruption? Should he get a rebuke, a demotion, a dismissal? What about a different priest who has a child after his ordainment? It’s not <em>explicitly</em> forbidden, but it’s close enough. An Angel who flees a tough situation and leaves a group of soldiers to die. What if they’re civilians? What if they come back covered in darkness? Under-the-table promises and favor-trading amongst the bishops. Trainees sneaking out of campus. Angels who are <em>just a little</em> too nosy?” She looks up at you with a very slight smile. “Could you design a system that’s completely fair?”

    “... Wh - isn’t that what judges are for? Or... laws?”

    “<em>No one</em> is above the Inquisition. That’s how it works. Politicians and judges can set laws, other primes and your predecessors can set standards, sure. But you have to be in charge of reviewing those too! Are the <em>laws</em> corrupt? Was the person who held your title before you corrupt? Having that kind of authority almost makes it harder to know what to do, since nothing can be absolutely certain when there’s no restrictions, you know?”

    You don’t, not really. You’ve never been in that kind of situation. “So... the prime just has to do what they think is right?”

    “Yeah. And they’re only human. Despite their blessings.”

You never heard from anyone higher than that one bishop. “I’d be terrified of messing up. Of hurting someone who doesn’t deserve it.”

    “And yet, if you’re too lenient...” She catches your gaze again; you’re reminded that her irises are shockingly purple. Such an unnatural color. She must be using transmutation magic like Clarity. “People get hurt anyway. It’s a balancing act, and one that will never, ever be fair.”

    “You’ve... spent a lot of time thinking about this.”

    “...” She doesn’t respond, but quickly goes back to her sewing. Faster than before. Embarrassed? Anxious? You can’t quite tell. In any case, that’s the end of the conversation before you can even bring up more questions; she changes the topic shortly after.

    <em>Scene 61</em>
    Through a series of tangents, you end up talking about non-trivial medical care. How cheery the two of you are. But really, you’re not entirely sure how you got around to discussing what happens when an Angel is seriously injured out in the field, beyond their own ability to heal themself. Or - you’re more familiar with this one - they’re affected in some way and <em>seem</em> fine but maybe aren’t. Such as when you started glowing gold, or passed out at the wall, or even recently when you were concerned about some external influence pressing on your emotions. You didn’t get that checked out because you were worried about being thought insane, but you had considered it at least a little.

    Anyway, apparently both Angels and Cathedra staff can get treated at smaller clinics in the three main halls - each specializing in maladies of a particular aspect - which is another significant benefit to working for the church.

    “In the regular city, you just get regular care, and that’s usually after a long wait unless you’re someone important. But at the Cathedra (and that one hospital right near the city center) you can get magical healing from Angels. So it’s really rare for anyone in the Cathedra to die from a disease or not-immediately-fatal injury.”

    You suppose you knew that, but never really thought about it. “What about just old age, though? I mean, the Emissary doesn’t get into fights, but if he could just live forever...?”

    “I don’t think Angelic magic can completely stop a Body’s deterioration,” Naoriel says quietly. “You’re right; if we could, the regular staff would be immortal just like us.”

It’s... well, it’s God’s magic, and He can do... hmmm.” You had been about to say He can do anything, but that’s not actually true. God can’t defeat the corruption without destroying the world, for instance. He needs you for that. Who’s to say if He can keep someone alive indefinitely without - wait, that’s <em>you!</em> Of course He can do that! “No, He can! If God can make Angels immortal, then He must be able to make normal people immortal too. So... there has to be a way, right?”

    “Maybe. Maybe the way is to become an Angel, and I don’t think we’re going to be able to do that to just anyone anytime soon.” She shrugs again. “But maybe. Some people are working on it and have been for a while. I think Serri might be a little bit involved in that now, too; you can probably ask her.”

    You blink, quickly swapping away from your previous train of thought. “Huh? She’s - what?”

    “Well, she’s volunteering at the city center hospital. You knew that, right?”

    “...”

    “Jessamine, I thought you two were friends!”

    “Well, I - I knew she’d been doing some kind of special training, but she never told me what it was! Is that what she’s been doing this whole time? Wait, city center? You mean like, outside of campus?”

    “That’s the one. One stop down from the central station.”

    “But I thought she couldn’t do her own disguises yet! <em>I</em> can’t do my own disguises yet!”

    “I can’t either, but that doesn’t stop me from going out. Or you, or her.” She flips the jacket over, critically inspecting the stitches from the other side. “Hospital Angels are allowed to go out without a disguise, as long as they go straight there and straight back. People know we work there, so there’s no reason to get all crazy over it.”

    “I... I guess that makes sense.” You try to refocus; this shouldn’t be <em>that</em> surprising. “What, uh, does she do there?”

She’s being unusually expressive tonight. “You’re asking me instead of her?”

    “She’s not here and I’m curious!” you defend yourself. It’s not like you’ve been ignoring Serri or anything - you still do most of your magic coursework together, for one - she’s just been purposefully hiding this from you for some reason.

    “Hmmm... Well, not much of the magical healing yet; you need to be pretty advanced to be allowed to do anything to citizens. I’m not sure, really. Maybe just helping with the cleaning or paperwork or something like that? I bet Serri would know more specifics, though.”

    “Alright, alright. I’ll ask her later.”

    But there isn’t a good time to bring it up the next time you talk to Serri, as you’re both feverishly trying to work out how to tether an effect to yourselves instead of leaving it to float in the world. Even Erich struggles, but after a few days of work, he retains his position as the preeminent student in the course. And after a few more days, you and Serri manage to get it as well - to varying degrees - and you’ve almost forgotten about whatever it was you were going to ask her.

    And then it’s suddenly October, and then November, and it’s winter again. Yara is now a sixth year; Serri is now a second year. You and the others throw parties for both of them. December comes and goes without much fuss either; you quietly bring up the idea of a birthday celebration to Naoriel and end up with a low-key but fun evening. Somehow, she’s integrated pretty well into your circle. That fake friendship is pretty convincing.

    It’s only when Cevember begins and the last Calling day of the year is more than a month ago that you start to wonder where all the new Angels are. Not a single person has Ascended after you, all the way back in March. It’s not an unheard of gap, but it’s not particularly common - especially since there are only ten trainees right now and the average is twelve.

There’s literally nothing you can do about it, and there’s plenty to occupy you right now. The festival days are fast approaching and the trainee Angels will be doing “something” for them. What that “something” is, you will need to decide among yourselves. Which is going to go well and everyone will agree; you’re absolutely certain. (Not!)

    But before that inevitable disaster, there’s something even more exciting. You’re getting towards the end of your basic magic course and need to start thinking about specializing. No Angel can be proficient in every variety of magic right away, and even full Angels rarely attain their full strength in any more than two or three of the sixteen combinations. It’s time to choose the first path you’ll explore, with the understanding that you can always choose more or change your Mind entirely.

    So. What will it be?

    [The winner in each category will combine to form your initial specialization. If you pick Soul transmutation of any sort, you’ll reconsider and some second-places will win.]

    <em>Scene 62</em>
    You take some time to think about it, as temperatures drop and snow begins to blanket the city. The fog grows thicker, mixing with the snow to form a deep, muffling quiet. Sounds die away quickly; the crunching of your footsteps hardly echoes, even when you stray off the cleared paths. Somehow, the cold doesn’t bite as much as you remember, even though your uniform’s jacket doesn’t seem as thick as your previous winter coat. Another advantage to your divine Body.

    “Ah, your first specialization?” Yara muses, leaning back in his recliner. Even though you don’t get all that cold going outside, it’s still exceptionally cozy to sit in front of a fire, bundled up in blankets. Which is what you’re all up to today. “Have any ideas yet?”

    “A few...”

    A pause. “Let’s hear ‘em, then. C’mon, spit it out.” Etalyn is the assigned firekeeper today, so she’s sitting on a precarious stack of wood. It doesn’t look that comfy, but who are you to judge?

    “Well... I wanted to do something internal and with projection, but I’m not sure what aspect to choose. Body, Mind, or Soul.”

    “Hmm! And you?”

    Serri’s been a little distant lately, but you still have mostly the same friend group so you still hang out pretty often. She’s just sitting on more blankets. You’re not sure where they all came from, really. “Um... external Body projection. Or Soul, but...”

    “Ah ha! You’re thinking about becoming a healer, I take it?”

    She nods, seeming way more embarrassed than you think she should. There’s nothing wrong with that!

    “Well, I think we might be able to offer some advice to the both of you, eh, Ets?”

    “Yeah. Go ahead; you’re dying to talk about your Soul projection again.”

    “Oh, you know me so well. Serri, I started off with external Soul projection. Of course, I’ve branched out a great deal since then - particularly in the combat department - but my original reason for picking it was to learn how to cast Blessings.”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1205996199338057738 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1205996199338057738><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, February 10, 2024 4:58 PM">4:58 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“And... did that go well?”

    “Not at all!” he says happily. “I didn’t learn how to cast a proper Blessing until my fourth year, in fact! It’s devilishly tricky to get right, and it’s hard to practice because you aren’t allowed to try on anyone besides Angels until they’re confident you won’t accidentally do some damage. But Angelic Souls and normal human Souls have different properties, so it’s still difficult to make the transition even once you’ve gotten it right on your fellow trainees.”

    “Ah...”

    “But of course, that’s not the only thing you can do with Soul projection. I did become quite proficient at simple force projection - extremely important in the wastelands to defend against the ambient poison and any darkness creatures - as well as general Soul restoration. Which is, well, also very important in the wastelands to protect the soldiers out there with you. You can also grant temporary magical abilities to others with Soul projection, but it’s not as useful as you might think.”

    He seems to be waiting for someone to ask him why that is. “Why not?” you oblige.

    “Ah! Consider the following: you have just granted an ordinary human the ability to cast some very exciting magic. Then, you instruct them to cast it. ‘Just attune your resonance phase and project your Soul towards the target,’ you say, receiving a blank stare (and no magic!) in return. See the problem?”

    “No one except Angels are trained to use magic?”

And granting magic to another Angel usually doesn’t do anything either, as they’re all able to cast anyway. You can provide extra Soul energy, which can be quite helpful if your partner specializes in something else, but the basic strength to channel your Soul at all isn’t usually helpful.” He does a sweeping motion to point at one of the walls. “Some special soldiers do spend some time training with magic and would know what to do in such a situation, but in most cases it’s just easier to have the Angel cast whatever is needed on their own than go through a middleman.”

    You nod; it makes sense.

    “Plus,” he continues. “Some people have objections to non-Angels channeling their Souls. Magic is considered to be a divine activity, after all, so even though the scriptures don’t mention anything about it, some people consider it blasphemy to have a normal human do it. I personally don’t see the issue, since we’re all humans anyway and the power comes from an Angel even if you don’t believe that, but just... something to know about.”

    “... What about Body, then?” Serri asks.

    “Hm? Oh, I’m not sure. Ets, any comments on external Body projection?”

    “It’s good.” She gives a thumbs up. “Really useful. You should do it.”

    “... That’s it?”

    “Yep. You didn’t wanna sell Soul projection, so I don’t need to sell Body projection. She’s already convinced. Right, Serri?”

    “Er... Yeah...”

    “Hum. Well, you may just have to be a little more thorough for <em>Jessamine</em>, however, who has <em>three possible options</em> to choose from!”

    Etalyn looks at you. “Hmmm... nope. She’s not gonna pick Body.”

    “What? You can’t-” He turns to you. “- It’s true?”

    “Well... yeah, probably. I’m not going to fight anything for a while yet, so learning how to heal or enhance my Body doesn’t sound as useful as Mind or Soul. I’m constantly getting into trouble with one of those aspects, but Body not so much.”

Well, that does make sense. Unfortunately, I’ve only focused on external magic and Ets on Body, so neither of us have significant experience in internal Mind or Soul projection.” He pauses, thinking. “... But, from what you’ve been telling me about your extreme sensitivity to Soul, that might be a good one to develop. At the very least, you could learn how to better brace yourself against strong Souls or the corruption.”

    “... Yeah, I could...” It would be extremely useful to be able to head out to the wall again without collapsing, or face off against a darkness creature without passing out. “But a stronger Mind would be helpful too...”

    “There’s no wrong choice here,” Yara reminds you. “Well, except for Soul transmutation; Cobb would probably not appreciate that. But if you think Mind would suit you better, there’s nothing wrong with it.”

    “You’re thinkin’ about Endle Day, aren’t you?”

    You look up in surprise. “You’re very perceptive,” you note to Etalyn. “I know it’s been months, but I still... keep coming back to it. I just don’t believe that difference was normal. And I want to train so I can be sure of it. So I can definitely be myself the next time I go back.”

    A second thumbs up. “Good. Useful. You should do it.”

    You think you just might.

    <em>Scene 63</em>
    The talk about specializations - and specifically, Serri’s interest in healing - reminded you of something Naoriel had mentioned... gosh, it must have been months ago by now. Your memory is improving with both the general changes to your Mind from your Ascension as well as your training, but it’s still all too easy to slip up and forget things for ages.

    Anyway, the two of you leave the common room’s warmth behind head out into the cold to practice tethering. Internal spells, perhaps contrary to their name, don’t necessarily have to work on something inside you. Most of them do - enhancing your Body, Mind, or Soul - but internal physical spells are actually just effects that stay anchored on you instead of the world around you. There are some external spells that can work like this too, the lines are blurry, and the categories are all made up anyway. It doesn’t matter. You’re just out here to create auras of warmth around yourselves and see how long you can focus.

    It’s a pretty chilly day and the wind is strong, so you’ve got strong incentive to perform well. Deep breath, sense the world around your Body, form the connection...

    “...”

    This part takes a while. It’s hard to describe what action you’re actually taking when you change resonance phases, but it’s not a simple one. In any case, you get it eventually and start warming the air around yourself, neatly compartmentalizing that focus into a section of your Mind so you don’t have to think about the spell while you’re walking around. Well, you still do, just not as much. Also, you called that compartmentalization “neat” just a moment ago, but you’re lying to yourself. You’re not very good at it yet.

    Another victory for self-honesty. Serri manages to bring up a similar bubble of warmth a few moments later and off you go. It’s kind of fun to look back at the melted footstep-shaped holes in the snow as you pass.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1206773907085066250 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1206773907085066250><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, February 12, 2024 8:28 PM">8:28 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>And now, the real reason you needed that Mind trick to free up some concentration. “Hey, Serri, you good to talk?”

    “... I’m okay.” She’s not that bad with the Mind stuff; it’s just her Soul control that’s still behind yours. She should be able to keep enough focus available to talk.

    “You seemed a little anxious about wanting to be a healer back there. Just hard to talk about your plans, or...?”

    Crunching footsteps with that little slushy sizzle you’re familiar with after having done this a few times. “No... not really.”

    “...” Give her some time.

    “It’s a dumb reason, really. You’re gonna laugh.”

    “C’mon, you know I won’t.”

    “...”

    “Really!”

    “... You know, Brother Cobb thinks it’s a great idea. For me to become a healer.”

    “That’s good-”

    “My family thinks so too. And everyone I know here. No one’s saying I shouldn’t. I bet you think it’d suit me too, right?”

    “Er...” You’re sensing a trap of some sort, but you’re not entirely sure what. Plus, she’s not wrong. “Yes?”

    “That’s the reason.”

    “... What? Sorry, the reason is that everyone supports you?”

    “I told you it’s a dumb reason. Sort of. Hang on.” You notice a lack of warmth from your right side; Serri’s spell has slipped. You wait a bit for her to get it active again, focusing on your own magic to shore up and reform bits of the bubble. Your Soul, technically, but it’s still weird to think of it like that.

    She gets it back together and off you go. Again. “I know I don’t seem like someone who would last a minute in the wastelands, fighting against the darkness. I know there’s plenty of need for healers and support back here, and I know it’s a worthy way to help everyone. I don’t think anyone who does it is weak or anything. I just... feel like...” She struggles to find some words. “Like a wimp. Like I’m not good enough to be out there fighting, so everyone’s pitying me and saying I should go be a healer here, where I’ll be safe and won’t get anyone hurt.”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1206773966337740830 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1206773966337740830><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, February 12, 2024 8:28 PM">8:28 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Se-”

    “And I <em>know</em> that’s dumb to think. I’m not even in my third year yet! I’m still learning and getting better! You don’t have to go over all the counterarguments you definitely have because you’re just smart like that, because I already agree! Here, let me list some!” A breath, but you don’t dare interrupt. “It takes just as much skill to heal someone as it does to harm someone. I’m not dumb or weak or unskilled for doing it. It’s even more noble to save people than to fight in the wastes. I’m way more useful to God doing something I’m good at here than getting killed out there. I get it. I know. Sorry.”

    A few breaths. What are you supposed to do about that? “It... sounds like you’ve been thinking about this a lot.”

    “... Yeah. I have.”

    “...” You’ve never been good at comforting people or giving advice. Socially awkward since six years old, and probably even before that. But you’re not that Jessamine anymore. “Do you <em>want</em> to become a healer? Setting aside if it’s practical or if anyone approves or not. Just... do <em>you</em> want to?”

    “I don’t know. It’s not like that’s <em>all</em> I’d be doing, either. Everyone has to go on missions. It’s just how many and where to.”

    That didn’t answer the question at all. Maybe if you rephrased it. “Do you want to fight?”

    “...” You’ve come to a small hill near Forger Hall. The trees surrounding the practice field are evergreens, so even though you can hear the distant chimes of clashing swords, you can only see the peaceful, snowy pines. “You remember when we went to the wastelands?”

    You half-wince. “Yeah...”

    “I was so surprised that it was so lively. Not much of a ‘wasteland’ at all, really. It’s so pretty, in its own twisted, corrupt way.”

    “...”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1206773973241823252 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1206773973241823252><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, February 12, 2024 8:28 PM">8:28 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“I wonder what the shades think of us. They have Minds, right? Somehow they managed to avoid God’s will and regain their ability to think.” She stares off at the trees by Forger Hall. “Do you think anyone has ever talked with a shade? They don’t speak our language, but surely if they have Minds, we can figure something out.”

    “They’re evil, though. What would they even talk about?”

    “Right, evil. Sorry.”

    You get the feeling you said something dumb, but in your defense you weren’t expecting her to suddenly start wondering about talking shades.

    “Anyway, I don’t know. Do I want to fight? I...” A pause. She holds out her hand and grasps an imaginary sword, lowering into one of the stances you recognize from your Body course. “I don’t want to be weak.”

    You’re supposedly still just talking about your first area of specialization, but her phrasing makes it seem like the question is a lot broader. About the future generally, not just the next year or so. “You’re not weak, whatever you want to pick. But... I think you should try to make whatever decision <em>you</em> want to make, not just what the people around you think. If... if you want to fight, then you should.”

    “... Thanks.” A pause. “But... and I hope you don’t take this the wrong way, but that’s easy for you to say.”

    “Huh?”

    “Has anyone actually gone up and told you what you should be? A healer, a fighter, an Inquisitor? Have you overheard one of your instructors wondering if you’ll improve enough before graduation? Jess, I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but I’m kind of a bad Angel.”

    “W-what? No you aren’t-”

    “I’m constantly behind in anything magical. You and the others have to help me with most of my homework. Erich hates how I keep slowing Brother Cobb down, so I don’t ask as many questions anymore-”

    “Wait, I thought you were just getting better at-”

    “Sure, I can do most of what people want me to do, but it always takes longer or isn’t as good and as a favored servant of God, ‘almost good enough’ just isn’t good enough!” Another pause. Both of you have lost focus on your warmth auras by now. “Sometimes I think about asking the Emissary to just turn me back.”

    “Woah, okay, slow down. I... had no idea.”

    “Yeah. I didn’t tell you. You’ve been too busy lately, but at least you’re best friends with Naoriel now.”

    “H-hang on-”

    “Sorry, that wasn’t fair.” A pause; she turns away. The warmth aura comes back up and you take a moment to restore your own as well. It’s cold. “And it’s not fair to make you deal with all my problems too. Just forget everything I just said and let’s go back to magic practice.”

    “Serri, you can’t-”

    “I don’t want to talk about it.”

    “... But-”

    “Jessamine. I do not. Want to talk about it.”

    “...”

She says a bunch of really worrying things about not being good enough and even <em>wanting to stop being an Angel</em>, then just expects you to ignore all of it? And how far back does she want you to forget? Not like you’re going to, but if you’re going to say anything you’d rather she not cut you off again. But what should you even say? It’s been too long now and the silence is awkward. She’s still not looking at y - oh, now she is.

    “Okay,” Serri says quietly. “I’ll learn how to fight.”

    “...” You still don’t know what to say, but you’ve gotta say <em>something.</em> “Is that what you want to do?”

    “No. But it’s closer than staying here.”

    “And what <em>do</em> you want to do?”

    “I want to understand the wastelands. And there’s no way to do that without going out there.”

    You can’t decide if that’s a perfectly reasonable thing to want or a perfectly concerning one. You’d like to understand the wastes as well, though you might have phrased it differently. Well, given the circumstances, maybe you should just give her a break. It’s not like this is a binding resolution for the rest of your lives, anyway.

    The rest of the walk passes by quickly as you speak only occasionally. With Hearth Hall now in sight, you figure you’ve got to make at least one more try to address the, well...

    “Serri, you might think you’re not good at anything, but that’s just not true. Sure, magic doesn’t come as easily to you as, say, Erich, but that’s just one skill. It’s not everything you are as an Angel or a person. I’m bad at a whole bunch of things; they’re just different things than you are.” You hesitate, kind of surprised she hasn’t stopped you by now. “Do you, uh, get it?”

    “... Yeah. Thanks; I’ll keep that in Mind.”

    She was ahead of you on the path when she said that, so you couldn’t see her expression.

    “And, Jess? Can you please keep what we talked about to yourself?”

But you can’t just say no, right? And if you make that promise...

    “Please. I’ll talk to someone about it when I’m ready.”

    “... Okay,” you agree. “Just try not to wait too long.”

    A brief smile and in you go. She didn’t say no, but she also didn’t say yes. You’re not entirely reassured.

    Serri doesn’t bring it up again for a few days as you wait, cautiously watching your words around her and keeping your promise, no matter how much you might want to break it. You walk around campus several more times to practice your warming auras under various levels of distraction. No one seems to be preparing for the “something” that the trainees will be doing for the festival and you’re starting to get worried that you’re going to have to take initiative or nothing will happen.

    And then, in the aftermath of a storm that left thick layers of fresh, fluffy snow across the city, Serri challenges you to a duel.

    “Well, a sparring match, really. Nothing official. I just want to see how well my practice is setting in.”

    “I - I mean, sure. I’m not sure I’m that good, though; Etalyn or someone would be a much better teacher.”

    “I don’t want a teacher, though. I want someone more on my level.”

    “R-right. That makes sense.”

    “I’ll watch if you want,” Etalyn calls from across the room, hardly glancing in your direction. “Give you some pointers afterwards. Plus, it’s always fun t’see newbies beating each other up.”

    “Er-”

    “That sounds good; thanks, Etalyn.”

    “??” You look between then, but there’s no evidence of collusion. Serri and Etalyn don’t usually get along. Maybe something’s changed? Or maybe you’re reading too much into it, as usual.

But... you somehow doubt she’s all <em>that</em> good. Your own skill is probably average, though you admittedly haven’t been focusing on it compared to your other aspect courses.

    <em>Scene 65</em>
    ...

    The sparring field is surrounded by trees and covered in deep, fluffy snow. The groundskeepers usually keep it clear, but nothing is scheduled today and there’s still an ongoing dusting of light flakes, so they haven’t gotten around to it yet. With the shifting layers of partially-frozen sand and powdery snow, it’s already tough to keep your footing even just walking to the starting locations. Serri definitely could have chosen a better day. Or maybe this is part of her plan?

    You grip the unfamiliar weight of your sword, sweeping it through the snow to get a sense of the drag. Hard to work with. It doesn’t cut through nearly as well as a real one.

    “Alrighty, pay attention, you two.” Etalyn has found her way into a tall referee’s chair. She’s probably actually certified to sit there, given all her demonstration matches. “Standard practice rules: first to three full hits wins. Magic is allowed, but no direct magical attacks (since I don’t know that cool warding spell) and for God’s sake try not to seriously hurt each other. I know the swords are just wood, but they’re heavy enough to knock you out real fast.”

    She’s right. The blade you’re holding isn’t steel or starmetal, but it’s heavy enough to handle similarly to either. If swung with your full strength, it could easily be extremely dangerous. Both you and Serri are wearing some padded training armor, but it’s hard to trust it given how lightweight it is. At least you get some at all; matches with real weapons have the wards instead.

    “Also, if one of you forfeits or gets beat up too bad, I’ll call it off. Just don’t do any damage that’s more complicated than I can heal, kay?”

    “...Kay...”

    “Great. Let’s see... anything else? Oh, yeah, don’t hold back. It’s no fun if you guys aren’t really trying. Okay, ready?”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1208232721051160586 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1208232721051160586><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, February 16, 2024 9:05 PM">9:05 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>You are. It can take you easily half a minute to switch your resonance phase - an eternity in battle - so you’ve done so in advance, attuning your Soul to the physical world around you. Direct attacks may not be allowed and you may not be good enough to enhance your Body or Mind like Etalyn does, but you should be able to create little environmental effects nearby to throw Serri off balance. At least, if you can focus long enough to do so.

    “Alrighty, go.”

    You’re taken a little aback by her unceremonious statement, but cautiously work your way forward after a second or two. Serri does similarly, neither of you charging in. That snow... can you do something with it? You could probably blow it around to obscure her vision; with your enhanced Soul sight, maybe that could be helpful?

    “Get on with it! Don’t just stand there!”

    Right. You still don’t know anything about Serri’s fighting style, so maybe you should try to - oh jeez-

    When you’re only about ten feet apart, Serri suddenly leaps towards you, kicking up a huge fan of snow with her legs and sword. It’s so fluffy that the cloud goes everywhere, blinding you for a moment. Bad position to be in; backpedal. Get out of range. Something heavy and wooden hisses past your Body at around stomach level, the blade just missing you. Hang on; change direction. Brief opening. One step forward, slash from the same direction so her sword can’t possibly be in the right place to block, and... miss entirely? Where-

    There’s a sudden impact to the back of your leg. The surprise coupled with the force of the blow actually manages to sweep you off your feet and you tumble backwards to thump into the snow. <em>That</em> sudden shock isn’t quite enough to break your focus, but it is enough to accidentally release that spell you’ve been preparing.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1208232782925537340 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1208232782925537340><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, February 16, 2024 9:05 PM">9:05 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Wind blasts out around you and the snowcloud breaks apart, flung away into the air. Serri’s to your <em>right</em>, not ahead of you, and your clumsy swing thuds into the padding on her side as she shields herself from the wall of snow and air. Nowhere near enough to hurt, unlike the actually really painful blow to your calf. Good? In any case, both of you scramble away to climb to your feet. Your leg really hurts, but it still works well enough.

    “One each, I think,” Etalyn yells. “Tough to see through all the snow.”

    Serri rushes you again. You’re too off-balance to try anything magically tricky - probably why she didn’t wait - so have to do your best to defend just by blocking her sword with yours. It’s a lot harder than you had originally thought, even after practicing for so many months. Trying to anticipate a swing or thrust and react in time, as well as get your own hits in, just takes a lot of quick thinking and agility. And she’s <em>strong</em>, too. The blows send shocks through the wood and your arms, sometimes pushing you back even though you’re just about fast enough to block properly.

    You’re probably going to lose if this keeps up; you just don’t have the endurance to keep blocking for much longer. Already, your movements are slowing down and you’re having to breathe more heavily. Gotta find an opening. You’re still attuned to the physical world, so if you can just get a second to - there!

    Another blast of wind picks up and sprays snow everywhere. It’s the same trick twice, but that doesn’t matter if it works both times. You duck low and thrust upwards, scoring your second hit and surely knocking the wind out of - huh? Really; she was fast enough to get partially out of the way? You still hit, but only on the edge of her chest. Enough to count, but again not enough to hurt. Although you probably should be glad for that, really.

    “Two for Jess,” Etalyn comments from behind you now.

She can probably tell how tired you are just as well as you can, but somehow she hardly seems winded. You’re forced several steps back, barely keeping your footing on the uneven snow as you try to get some space away from the repeated, heavy blows. Your breathing is labored now; the air is so dry you almost cough. But just one more hit. Come on! You-

    You can’t breathe.

    Your lungs ache; you can’t get enough air. Suddenly panicked, you completely miss your next block and Serri’s sword crashes into your side, right below your ribs. Of course, that blow doesn’t make your lungs feel any better. You fall to your knees in the snow, coughing and gasping for air, feeling another tap on the head before Serri notices something is wrong.

    “Two and three. Congratulations to Ser-”

    “Etalyn! Something’s really wrong with Jessamine!”

    This is your sickness. The disease you’ve been dealing with since you were six. Two years in the hospital, then a discharge and a return to ordinary life. Mostly. Still cautious about physical activity, still treated like you were made of glass. Like you could overexert yourself and stop breathing at any moment. Cured, when you became an Angel.

    Or so it seemed.

    <em>Scene 66</em>
    Etalyn leaps down from the referee’s chair, landing in yet another cloud of snow before rushing over to you. “God,” she grumbles as she kneels to inspect you. “What did I say about seriously hurting each other?”

    “I - I didn’t-”

    “Yeah, yeah, I know. Gimme a minute.”

    Warm healing magic flows from her touch and through your Body. Undirected, unsure of the specific issue, but rather just providing you with additional energy to fight whatever it is yourself. Luckily, you’ve had plenty of practice and the energy helps. A minute or two goes by as you just focus on trying to calm your Body down and stop the horrible coughing. It’s not one of the worst attacks like those that got you hospitalized in the first place, and you’re able to get control back shortly.

    You give a shaky thumbs up. “I’m okay now.”

    “... Jessamiiiiine!” Serri kneels down to hug you. She’s apparently been crying for a bit; you hadn’t noticed because you were a little preoccupied. “I’m so sorryyyyy! It happened again!”

    “Wh-what? You didn’t do this. What do you mean ‘again?’”

    “This is - back at the wall - with the wolf - it’s the second time you collapsed because of meeee...”

    “Wha - but we agreed that wasn’t your fault. I’m just extra sensitive to Soul energy, remember?”

    “But it was still madder than it would have been, and today... I don’t really know what happened, but if you hadn’t been out here at all...”

    “W-well...” She’s not actually wrong, but agreeing definitely wouldn’t help anything. “You didn’t know. And I didn’t, either. I thought... I was cured.”

    “This is something you’ve seen before?” Etalyn asks, done with the healing for now.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1208826830241661008 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1208826830241661008><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, February 18, 2024 12:26 PM">12:26 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“... Yeah. I didn’t want to tell anyone, and I thought it wouldn’t matter because my Ascension cured it, but if it’s still happening...” A breath; not a deep one, since that could set you off again. Just a breath. “I got sick when I was six, and I stayed in the hospital for two years. It was like this: any sort of strain could set it off. I had to be really careful to not run around or exhaust myself even after getting released, and even when I was ‘normal,’ I didn’t have as much energy or endurance as other kids my age. I could always still feel it lurking there, ready to hurt me if I ever slipped up.”

    Another moderately shallow breath; you think you can stand up now. Serri’s still clinging to you. “I felt so much better after becoming an Angel that I thought it must have been cured. And I’ve never had an attack since then - until now - even if I really pushed myself. I... don’t know what changed. If it’s coming back and getting stronger, or if it was just luck, or if this was just the most demanding thing I’ve done since I got here.”

    A hesitation. You want to say it’s fine and not to worry about it. You’ve been dealing with this for most of your life at this point. But... you can’t quite bring yourself to say it. If you can’t fight like this, are you really cut out to be an Angel? Are they going to send you back? And if God Himself couldn’t cure whatever is wrong with you... there’s no hope anyone else can, right?

    “Alright, up ya get. Shoulda told us earlier, dummy. Can’t get this thing cured properly if you never say anything.”

    “Cure - but, if the Ascension didn’t-”

    “Ascension ain’t trying to cure diseases. It’s just makin’ you an Angel. If you wanna do somethin’ specific with your Body template for a long term thing like this, you gotta do it specially. Now come on and let’s go get you fixed up.” A pause; she eyes Serri. “Hey, you go run ahead and get Ben. Just inside; he’s an Angel if you couldn’t guess. Kay?”

You get a strange sense of deja vu watching her leave that only deepens as Etalyn now turns to you, clearly in no hurry to follow.

    “Alright, Jess, I don’t wanna worry her, but you gotta know. You were leaking some sorta black Soul smoke when you were coughing. Doubt she noticed, but I was already attuned from earlier. You know anything about that?”

    “... No.”

    “Figures. Sometimes this sorta thing gets into your template if it’s left too long. Ternary conflux, or whatever they call it. Where all three aspects affect each other. Even if your Soul’s stubborn, it’ll change if given enough time.”

    “What... does that mean?”

    “Oh, Jess, you’re smart enough to know. Means you’ve probably got a long road ahead to change it back. But it’ll be doable. Just might take a few years.”

    “Years...” You can’t decide whether to be relieved or upset. Upset because you had (until today) thought it was already over? Or relieved because (as of a minute ago) you thought you might be stuck with it forever?

    “Yeah. Don’t worry, Ben’s seen this a lot. He’s into long term recovery; helps all sorts of people with permanent conditions to make them not so permanent.” She waves her hand like wiping away a troublesome stain. “I’m sure he’ll say-”

    “This is beyond my abilities.”

    “Oh, for-” Etalyn grumbles into her hands on the other side of the room.

    Ben is tall and broad, looking like he’s capable of lifting entire carriages without magic. But his touch (physical as you watch him move papers and equipment around, and magical as he examines the situation) is gentle. “I’m sorry, but my specialty is Body. I can remove the sickness temporarily, but it reasserts itself extremely quickly. Minutes, at best. There must be something deeply entwined in the Soul for it to restore itself so aggressively, but for some reason, I can’t tell what it is. You will undoubtedly need a Soul specialist to untangle where the problem lies.”

    And so here you are, again, in that cold, sterile doctor’s office-looking room in Illim Hall. Alone, aside from the ghostly-haired Archangel who’s now examined you three times for various Soul-related issues.

    Aveline does not seem pleased today. And that’s no surprise, because nearly half an hour ago, she had to admit that even she - the Angel who has made a name for herself by specializing in even the most hopeless cases of Soul restoration - can’t tell where specifically the problem lies. You’re not pleased either. Especially because you’ve been sitting here doing nothing for half an hour without being allowed to leave or being told what’s going to happen next. Just that “someone else will be here soon.”

    “...” You’re still intimidated by her, and you’re starting to get really terrified that no one will be able to fix you. Despite Etalyn’s strong words, she’s only a trainee like you. She doesn’t know everything. And even these powerful, holy adult Angels don’t know. Who else could they possibly ask?

    The door clicks quietly open and you have to do a double take, the sight of him here is just so incongruous.

    Followed by two Angels with starmetal swords at their hips, the Emissary himself walks through the door. “Archangel,” he says, nodding to Aveline. “And Angel Jessamine Goodall. How are you feeling today?”

    “---!”

    He smiles a calm little smile, shuffling into the room and asking one of his guards to bring a chair over. “Surprised, I see. That’s good; the fewer people who know where I am, the better. But you don’t have to worry. I am quite different outside of that stuffy old cathedral, you know.” A glance over to Aveline. “And <em>you</em> don’t have to worry, either. Failure is what makes us human. Even those of us with blessings like yours.”

    “... Thank you, Emissary.”

    A bowing nod. “Emissary.”

    “Very well.” He returns his focus to you. “Now, young Jessamine, I’ve been told they would like me to look into your Soul. Would you be so kind as to tell me what I should be looking for?”

    <em>Scene 67</em>
    You’ve come a long way from the first time you met him. It also helps that he’s so much less intimidating without the Lordstone Cathedral as a backdrop. In any case, you’re able to explain what you know without too much issue, covering the background of your sickness as a child, the recovery after your Ascension, and the recent resurgence. You even bring up what Etalyn said about the Soul smoke, though you were too preoccupied to verify that particular detail.

    The Emissary nods and listens, only speaking up once you finally finish rambling your way through the information. “I understand. You’ve done quite well to mitigate this sickness’s power over your life. Let me see if I can help you further.”

    His gaze changes. Not the unnaturally golden color of his eyes or anything about the shape or tone. Just... something about how the room’s ambient light interacts with his Body has changed. Sharp, piercing. He stares into you as his divine insight picks apart your Soul.

    A brutally uncomfortable minute passes. Far longer than he spent inspecting you during your initiation. You don’t dare speak or even move.

    Finally, the Emissary steps back with a sigh and turns away to rub his eyes. “Ah, Aveline, I understand the trouble.” Then, a turn back to you. “But I believe I can see the source. I would just like a few more details. Jessamine, can you remember anything from before your sickness? Would you please recount a memory or two, if you recall?”

    “Er...” You think back. That was so long ago; before you turned six. Is there even anything there? Ah. “Sunlight. The mist was really thin one day. I think I had just started school, when everything got so bright out the window. I didn’t know what to think of it; I was just amazed by how much light there could be.”

    “Good. Anything else?” His eyes are different again; is he looking even now?

    “That’s quite alright. How would you describe your relationship with your family?”

    “... T-that’s, um... I...” The Emissary doesn’t interrupt, simply regarding you with that same calm little smile. “G-good?”

    “Hmm. Would you care to elaborate? Has anything happened recently?”

    “...” God, you really don’t want to talk about this. “I-it used to be good. My parents; my brother, even though he was annoying, he’d always help me whenever I needed it. And they’re still like that, but...” Wait, were you even allowed to go out like you did? You’re supposed to be disguised at all times; no, that’s fine, they would have said something. “When I visited them last, it just felt... different. Like we were almost strangers, even though it had only been less than a year.”

    “I see. It can be hard to be apart for so long. One more question: how would you say you are fitting in with your fellow Angels?”

    “Good? I get along with most people and have a few good friends here.” You finish your thought a little awkwardly, like you had planned to keep speaking but cut yourself off after finding you didn’t have anything more to add. Well, not “like” that; exactly that. That’s what happened.

You’re still not sure what exactly the difference is. “Jessamine, I will be very straightforward with you. I’ve noticed some unusual structures in your Soul that seem to be relatively old, and then some much newer strain surrounding them. There is no evidence of corruption, though some of these twists could become problematic with the wrong push. I would have noticed the strain during your Ascension - and Aveline would have noticed during your last visit - so it must be more recent than that. Given the unfortunate experiment you were involved in, it seems plausible that-”

    You take a breath, ready to interrupt and defend Yara, but then remember that you’re speaking to the closest man to God in the world. You hold your tongue.

    “-there may be some connection, but I do find it unlikely. The energy involved was far too low. Similarly, your exposure to the corruption during Founding Day may have played a part, but again was too well-controlled to be a likely culprit. And of course, either are too long ago to be more than idly considered. I’m afraid it’s simply unclear what may have caused this strain, though...” He pauses, considering. “Actually, when did you last visit your family?”

    “... Endle Day.”

    “August. That could fit; was the event somewhat distressing?”

    “... Yes.”

    The Emissary seems relieved. “Emotional strain can cause Soul strain as well. We likely don’t have to worry about that, then. Please continue with your Mind training and you should have fewer issues with similar events.”

    “O-okay...”

    “Emissary, if I may?”

    “Archangel.”

    “I did note the strain in my report, but what are these structures you refer to? Are they related to the sickness?”

Many of your more recent traits seem to be built upon this foundation or are otherwise connected to it - which may make sense if you believe the sickness has had a major impact on your life so far. Would you agree?”

    “Y-yes. It has.” An understatement.

    “Based on how it reacted to my questioning, it seems that removing the sickness from your template would remove an enormous amount of additional context along with it; much of what makes you ‘you.’ In order to properly treat it, we would need to carefully extract just the specific portion that makes you physically ill, without disturbing anything built atop it, and fill in that void with something else. The operation would be incredibly precise and would run a very high risk of changing your personality. I’m afraid that I would never approve such a procedure on anyone unless their condition is life-threatening.”

    “...”

    “But that doesn’t mean there’s nothing we can do. We can still attempt to build on the existing structures and drive out the sickness through growth, rather than extraction. Aveline, if I show you the specifics, could you design...”

    The two of them start to discuss advanced techniques and possibilities for treatment; you know hardly any of the words and can’t grasp what they’re saying. Still, the gist of it is clear: you’re stuck with this sickness for quite a long time. Forever? Maybe; maybe not. Based on Etalyn’s ideas, probably at least years. But the fact that it’s <em>part</em> of you - so intrinsically tied to your very self that to remove it would be to change the very core of <em>who you are</em>...

    The concept seems insane.

    <em>Scene 68</em>
    “... one of the most open Souls I’ve seen in years...”

    ...

    Back in the lost, ancient days - before Angels and before the corruption - humanity’s Souls were open. You learned this months earlier in Brother Trigg’s course, but the concept returned to Mind as you overheard the Emissary’s words.

    Originally, human Souls could easily change phase and form to connect with each other and the world around them. Magic was commonplace; it hardly took more effort to control one’s Soul as it did to control one’s hand. Of course, you’re well aware that this ended tragically, with the corruption arising somehow (leading theories believe it was due to a random mutation that then spread too quickly to contain due to the world’s interconnectedness) and eventually causing the year-zero cataclysm.

    As the corruption spread, God took drastic measures to stop it, closing off humanity’s Souls from the world and each other; preventing further direct infection. This also cut off magic, however, crippling humanity’s ability to fight back and eventually leading to the Ascension of the first Angels to compensate. These Angelic Souls were bolstered in strength to be able to handle the connection required to use magic without succumbing to the corruption that inevitably came with it.

    As some scholars argue, Angels are thus more human than humans are. It’s not just Erich; there are plenty among your cohort and the Cathedra generally who believe that ordinary humans are somehow lesser after God’s change to their Souls. The loss of that connection - of that reflection of the divine’s own form - is something that only Angels have regained.

    Sometimes you wonder what God is like.

    You’re getting off track from your original topic, but you don’t care. It’s just easier to sit here and drift off in your own thoughts, bouncing from concept to concept whenever something occurs to you. You’ll come back to the important stuff later, probably.

Just like you; just like every human. You, and everyone else, are made in His original, divine image. But... what is He like, really?

    His Mind is embedded in the planet, at least partially, broken and diffused to keep the darkness uncoordinated. With more reports recently of shades growing stronger and the possibility of Mind-transferring magic seemingly not far away, you wonder how long He will stay there. Objects can have Minds, sort of, according to Brother Cobb, so is God... the planet? If He is, what will happen when He leaves it to return to His original Body? Will He?

    The only things you know about God’s Body are that it resides somewhere in the sky far above the planet, and that the Lordstone is a piece of it. So, what does - wait, you know one more thing, actually. You are a reflection of God, so He must look like you. Right? To an extent, at least; the same number of arms and legs and general Body plan. Presumably. But... you don’t have a crystal like the Lordstone embedded in you somewhere, do you? You haven’t gone into much depth on anatomy, but even you know that human Bodies are made of flesh and bone, not crystal.

    A seeming contradiction like that must have been investigated before; surely you’re not the first person to have the question. You’ll need to look it up later. Maybe the Lordstone is an analogue to your heart or brain or even an eye? Eyes can sort of look crystalline in the right light. Or maybe God is just formed entirely of somehow-mobile crystal, shaped into a human-like form?

    The idea of a gargantuan, divine, crystalline person floating somewhere far above strikes you as very silly, and you quickly apologize to God for thinking such a thing. And then, after further consideration, you apologize again for thinking your previous thought was silly, just in case it’s actually true.

God’s Soul. His third aspect isn’t talked about as much as the other two; your knowledge here is relegated mostly to the fact that He touches the Souls of Ascending Angels to grant them His strength. You’re not entirely sure what that means; maybe it’s sort of a stronger version of the Blessings that Angels can do? But that only takes up a tiny fraction of each year; what does He do beyond that?

    Souls quickly decay without a Body to inhabit and a Mind to tie the two together. You learned that from Brother Cobb again, but also from your history course when going over some of the frankly horrifying experiments done in the fourth century - just after Erejil’s death - relating to separating individual aspects from their fellows. Using the primitive measuring techniques at the time, Souls were observed disappearing a few hours to a few days after their Body’s (and Mind’s) death. Because the Bodies and Minds died simultaneously, it was unknown at the time whether the Soul required the Body, Mind, or both. And although ways now exist to destroy the Mind without killing the Body (thanks to the corruption) no one has repeated the experiment to confirm. For good reason.

    Would God’s Soul work the same way? With His Mind away, is His Body still alive? Is His Soul still tied to it, or does it reside with His Mind in the planet below? Both? Or are only humans so weak to require other aspects to maintain their Souls?

    You’ve reached an end to one train of thought and begin the arduous journey back to the root. Open Souls. Your own. It could explain your sensitivity to Soul... as well as your susceptibility to the corruption. But what caused it? Is the shape of your Soul just an innate trait, or was there something that changed you? Your sickness? Or something else?

    <em>Scene 69</em>
    It’s late and you’re in bed, unable to sleep. Again.

    You were pretty out of it for the rest of the day after all the stuff that happened. Serri and Etalyn listened to what you relayed about your sickness and possible treatments. They said some things in response, but you don’t remember. It’s kind of a blur. You feel it’s kind of unfair that you stole Serri’s crisis with your own, even though you obviously had no role in choosing to do so. You’ll probably have to get back to her about it once you’ve calmed down a bit.

    The sickness is hiding again. You can’t feel it anymore, just like pretty much all the time after your Ascension until just today. There’s no sense of it lurking within you, biding its time and waiting to strike. It’s just gone. You know better now, of course, but at least it seems you’ll be able to ignore it most of the time. If its behavior is still the same, it’s only going to be during exertion that you’ll have to be careful. Still, as you get older and stronger, you’re going to be fighting more. That is to be your job, after all. It’s not like you can ignore it completely.

    You hum the rhythm of some of the trigger words for the spell you’re supposed to be learning. Miracles often come with a specific ritual to perform in order to use them, primarily just to get you in the same Mindset as the creator. Ordinarily, you don’t need to say or do anything special to cause an effect; you just know what you want and impose your will on the target. You haven’t gotten this one to work yet, but of course it’s only been a few hours. You haven’t even finished the book.

Thoughts wandering. Drifting like the snow still falling outside. This year has had unusually heavy snowfall, according to the scholars who study that sort of thing. How do the wastelands look, all covered in snowdrifts? There aren’t any humans to clear them, outside of narrow bands around the walls and nearby train tracks. The snow must get unbelievably deep. You could probably sink into it entirely, just buried in a fluffy, frigid prison.

    The festival is coming up in only a few weeks and still no one has even started organizing the trainees for the still-unknown “something” you will ostensibly be doing. Who did you even hear that from? Is it actually going to happen at all? Vague thoughts of doing the organizing yourself are quickly dismissed; you don’t know what the “something” should be or if it’s even a real thing. Maybe this is just some weird prank. If it’s really supposed to happen, “someone” will do it. Probably.

    “...”

    You feel a little warm under the covers and still aren’t sleepy at all, so you grumpily toss them aside and stand up, padding over to the window on bare feet to look outside. You’re going to regret this in the morning if you can’t get to sleep, but what are you supposed to do if your Body just won’t cooperate? Honestly, you hadn’t noticed any issues with the building’s heating until tonight, but it just seems way too warm now. Even standing in the main room is little better, despite your very light attire and the winter wind just one pane of glass away.

    And then, all the excess warmth in the room seems to recede in an instant as you glimpse a lone figure through the mist and gently falling snow.

    Tall, cloaked in some sort of form-hiding clothes, and unlit by anything but the faintest light from nearby mechanical lamps, you can’t tell much about them. But you know they’re facing Hearth Hall, because after a few moments of just staring at the building, they begin to walk towards it.

Magic of some kind; there’s no way such a strong sensation could be anything else. You don’t know what it was intended to do or what it did - you don’t feel any different - but you <em>do</em> know that casting spells, on every Angel in the building, at night, while everyone should be sleeping, without anyone’s consent, is definitely not allowed.

    The figure disappears from view in an eddy of misty snow. They’re heading straight for the front entrance. Something is terribly wrong, you’re absolutely certain. Even though the winter night looks the same as before, you’re absolutely wide awake and brimming with fear. Something is telling you to act, and act fast.

    But what should you do?

    <em>Scene 70</em>
    “...!”

    You bolt to the door and sprint into the corridor, not slowing to get properly dressed or even find your shoes. <em>Now! Right now!</em> You hardly have any time to get downstairs to find whoever that is before you won’t know where to look. Oh, why did this have to happen <em>now?</em>

    It’s cold in the corridor, the mysterious warmth of your room left long behind. You hardly feel it, between your Angelic constitution and your other, much more extreme, preoccupations. <em>Serri; gotta get help.</em> Her room is just down the hall, unlike all your other friends’ on different floors. It hardly even occurs to you to worry about disturbing anyone as you knock loudly on her door - if anyone else gets up, that’s just more people to help you now. “Serri!” you call, caught somewhere between a desire to be as loud as possible to wake her up and a desire to be as quiet as possible so the mysterious figure can’t possibly hear you.

    “...”

    Nothing. God, she’s a really heavy sleeper; you forgot! She’s almost late all the time because of it! But - surely, someone else would have heard you, right? Maybe they’re just not coming out because you- “Anyone! Help!”

    “...”

    Nothing.

    With a sudden frigid tingle down your spine, you remember the reason you and Serri had been able to claim the sparring field today. It’s the 15th of Cevember, halfway through the month, and most of the full Angels who would normally reside in this building are out in the city right now. This is the Sulday of Charity and - to the Cathedra - there’s nothing more charitable than spending a late night in the snow with most available Angels helping as many people as possible. Campus has been empty all day. And, now, so is Hearth Hall. Well, except for your fellow trainees.

    Maybe someone else is a light enough sleeper to wake up, but at this point you don’t have time. You’re going to lose track of the mystery person if you don’t act fast!

    The door at the bottom of the stairwell clanks open.

    You freeze.

    Right. If you had taken the <em>leftmost</em> stairwell, closest to <em>your</em> room, you would have been able to get all the way downstairs without running into the mystery person, who (now that you think about it) would obviously take the middle stairwell, as that’s where the main entrance is. This is both good (since you found the mystery person) and definitely not good (since you <em>really</em> don’t want the mystery person to find <em>you</em>). And it’s not like you can just open a door and leave; the clanking sound would echo up and down the entire space.

    Footsteps. Heavy and booted, but fast. Your only hope is to just pray that wherever they’re going, it’s below the top floor. Quietly, carefully, immensely grateful that your rushed exit left you in a near-silent nightgown and without any loud shoes, you creep up the stairs towards the roof.

    The mystery person is much faster than you, not having to worry about keeping silent in the stairway, and you start to worry that you won’t make it to the top floor in time. The idea that maybe this is just some Angel who forgot something in their room and needed to come back for it never crosses your Mind. Not after that wave of energy. Instead, you can’t help but wonder what they <em>are</em> doing here. Why are they just climbing the stairs? There’s nothing here but Angels’ living quarters; are they here for theft, or... something worse?

    No way. Such an act would be a sin so severe it would be akin to spitting in God’s face. No one would do it. Unless...

    You focus inward. Your Soul is unusually bright tonight and it’s correspondingly easy to shift your phase. You open Soulbound eyes and search, peering below through the hazy obstructions of brick and wood. Corruption? Darkness? Could this be a shade, here to corrupt or assassinate sleeping Angels?

    <em>Scene 71</em>
    You vault over the railing and land on the sixth floor’s landing with a quiet thump, guided by your Body training both to avoid hurting yourself and avoid making too much noise. Then, you reach out and snag the door just before it shuts, carefully levering it open just enough so you can peek out into the hallway. The mystery person is close; you’re only a few paces behind them now. Still - thank <em>God</em> - you’ve managed to avoid them hearing you.

    They’ve slowed down now, looking up to check one of the signs displaying which rooms are in which direction, then turning around the right corner and leaving the common area. You cautiously slip out of the stairwell and ease the door shut as quietly as you can, trembling at the tiny <em>click</em> as the latch slips in. A brief pause; you’re horribly exposed if the person returns around to check what that noise was.

    “...”

    Nothing. You creep to the corner, sensing Soul again on the way over to get an approximate position. It’s hard to sense Souls around corners and through walls, but you’ve been generally able to make out Angelic Souls through (one) normal wall for a few months now. Anyway, the mystery person has made it partway down the corridor and seems to still be moving away, so you figure it’s safe enough to peek around the corner normally to see what’s going on.

    They’re moving slowly, glancing side to side in that muffling cloak to check the room numbers. Clearly searching for one in particular. Who’s on the sixth floor, again? It’s hard to remember with the, well, current situation, but... let’s see, there’s Denn, but he’s to the left. And besides him...

    Naoriel.

She’s always been worried about Inquisitors; being tailed by Zeke and Sims for a reason you still have yet to figure out. And an individual with a Soul like the mystery person can’t be anyone other than a powerful Angel. One with extra duties, perhaps? One who finally gathered <em>some</em> piece of evidence, enough to... do something horrible to her? Surely they wouldn’t just <em>kill</em> her, right? But... but then why... in the middle of the night?!

    The person stops. 607. Naoriel’s room. What... what do you do? What <em>can</em> you do?

    A key emerges; slots into the lock. A tiny click, audible to you only because you’re straining all your senses down the hallway. Your heartbeat almost drowns it out. You have to do something. But what? You can’t think through the panic.

    The door opens; the person enters. You sprint around the corner, completely unable to explain what your plan might be. Your feet hardly seem to touch the ground.

    They didn’t close the door, and somehow didn’t hear you, again. Are you really that quiet? You peek around the half-open door, able to make out two glimmering Souls in the dim light. She’s really there too; this isn’t some awful prank where Naoriel put on platform shoes and a weird cloak and then entered her own room. She wouldn’t have been able to fake the Soul anyway. You’re not thinking straight.

    A sheet of fabric emerges from the cloak. Unfolds. It’s not a sheet; it’s a bag. A sack. The near-cliche tool featured in cautionary tales across the city. And as the figure pulls off the covers and starts to slide the still-unconscious Naoriel into the bag, you have to change your assessment. This isn’t a murder. It’s a kidnapping.

    You <em>have</em> to stop it.

    <em>You</em> have to stop it.

    Oh, God.

    <em>Scene 72</em>
    You don’t stop to think. You just <em>do.</em>

    Somehow flipping your resonance phase in a matter of seconds - despite it taking you half a minute just earlier today - you gather the air and command it to your aid. A pause; a moment of brief low pressure as the breeze bends to your will. The mystery person looks up, finally noticing something is wrong.

    Not fast enough. You release, feeling the strain on your Soul as you twist it in ways you’ve only just started to practice. Still, you’re suffused with warmth and the air obeys. A torrent of powerful wind rushes through the room, tossing loose objects around and throwing Naoriel and her assailant in opposite directions.

    That was the strongest magic you’ve controlled to date.

    No time to stop and marvel at it; you dash into the confused mess of air, nearly stumbling over several books or paintings you knocked to the floor. <em>Surely</em> that has to have been enough to wake her up, right?

    No such luck. There’s powerful magic at work here; no way Naoriel would still be sleeping normally after having just been tossed to the floor like that. You kneel, grab her arms, slump her over your shoulder like you’ve seen some of the full Angels do, then try to stand. Urgh... heavy. You’ve never been particularly strong, even after your Ascension, but you can just about manage to stand up.

    ... Until the mystery person recovers. Their cloak has been blown away by the force of your blast, revealing them as a somewhat gaunt, unkempt man with patchy stubble on his face. You recoil as he leaps up from the other side of the bed, both due to the immediate threat and because he doesn’t look <em>anything</em> like an Angel. No Bodily perfection at all. But... the Soul - what?!

You, I did not expect.” His voice is scratchy and almost seems layered, like there are several of him speaking just out of sync with each other. “One of the older ones with more resistance, perhaps, but <em>you?</em> Put her down and no one has to get hurt.”

    You take a step back, towards the entrance. He doesn’t want to hurt you; at least, not enough to make open combat his first option. You have an opening. Memories of your combat courses whirl through your Mind. Older ones. Resistance. You can’t do this. Not on your own; you need help! You - your breathing...

    “Put her down. Now.” An edge of anger; the man places a hand on a short scabbard on his left hip. “Don’t do anything you’ll regret.”

    Why won’t anyone wake up? You’ve made so much noise! Even Naoriel - !

    “Okay...” you murmur, shuffling back another step and raising your arms to lean forward, as if you’re about to place Naoriel on the floor in front of you. But, at the same time, you switch to Mind. Again, the transition is almost instant; unbelievably quick for someone of your novice skill. But you’ve been practicing this spell ever since you decided to make Mind your specialization. Internally instead of externally, sure, but how different can it be?

    You bring your Mental connection with Naoriel to the forefront - reliving your shared experiences and thoughts over the last few months - and push as much energy into her head as you can muster. The simplest form of Mental projection magic, and one where the desired outcome is equally simple: to blast away any external influence.

    Such as, for instance, a sleeping spell.

    Naoriel gasps and stumbles out of your arms, falling heavily to the floor as you completely fail to catch her. You’ve been using a huge amount of energy; your Soul is already almost spent. And although casting magic doesn’t cause physical strain, your sickness is building as you exert yourself further.

    “Run! Go!” you scream, reaching down to pull her upright.

But, just as you’re about to reach it, there’s a rush of wind and the door slams shut. Then, another burst of energized air rustles your hair and clothes, though you can’t tell what this one was designed to do. The door is well and truly stuck; you can’t get it open even though the handle turns freely.

    “Calm down. Look at me.”

    You turn, shaking and almost out of tricks. Naoriel found a regular butter knife somewhere and is gripping it like a weapon. Neither of you can say anything, but that’s not because you aren’t trying. In fact, the air around you seems to have almost hardened, deadening any sound you might try to make.

    “You win. I’ll admit that,” the man says, hands casually in pockets as he kicks aside something on the floor. “I can’t do anything now without making a fuss or killing you both. And that’s just not something I’m willing to do.”

    W-what?

    “Even if I wiped your memory of this event, you’d naturally be questioned as one of her-” a nod to Naoriel; the man seems to be addressing you. “-friends. They’d find something. Erasure isn’t clean enough. So, I’ll leave. And I won’t be back. Not like this, at least. You have my word.”

    “...?!”

    “But. If either of you breathe a word of what happened here, to <em>anyone</em> else.” The sword emerges from its sheath. Starmetal glimmers in the low light. That blade is sharp enough to shear completely through your torso in a single swing. “Not only will I return, but someone may just receive an anonymous tip.”

    Finally, his eyes slide over to Naoriel. “Bastard child. I know <em>all</em> about you, and if you let a single peep slip out, your precious Emissary and all his primes will know it too.”

    Naoriel drops the knife. She’s shaking worse than you now.

Just not like this.”

    And out he goes, plummeting six stories. Except with control over the air like he’s just demonstrated, you doubt he’s even going to reach the ground. The silencing barrier falls apart a moment later.

    “...”

    Neither of you know what to say. You walk to the window instead, peek outside and see no one, then close it so the two of you don’t freeze in your thin nightclothes.

    “...”

    Naoriel hasn’t moved; she’s still kneeling on the floor and staring at the carpet. You kneel down next to her, cautiously shaking her shoulder. “... Are you okay?” Your voice sounds unnaturally loud in the sudden silence. You’re freezing, the warmth that’s been plaguing you on and off all night having vanished again. You have to suppress a cough in the cool air.

    “...” Finally, she manages to lift her head. “... Physically? F-fine.”

    You get the idea. “Mentally?”

    She shakes her head. “No, not at all.”

    Yeah. You can relate.

    A sharp breath; she focuses on your face. “Jessamine. Please. Before anything else happens, you have to promise me. Don’t tell anyone about this. I’ll explain if that’s what it takes to buy your silence, but please... if he’s telling the truth...” A breath. “I’ll figure it out. Just don’t tell anyone.”

    <em>Scene 73</em>
    “I promise.” You hesitate, but at this point you’ve got to know. “But since you offered, I do want you to explain what’s going on.”

    “I was afraid of that.” A pause; she glances around the room at all the mess. “Would... it be okay to talk in your room instead, though? I need to... do some cleaning later.”

    “That’s fine! Er, sorry about the-”

    “You just saved my life. Don’t be sorry. Be, er, thanked. Th-thank you.”

    ...

    It’s very late now; you get the feeling you’re not going to get any sleep tonight. At least tomorrow’s Sunday, so you don’t have any major obligations. Or is it today by now? Doesn’t matter. You’ve recounted your version of the night’s events to Naoriel, and now it’s her turn to explain.

    She’s curled up in a blanket on your sofa, only her head visible. “First of all, I don’t know who that was. In fact, I’m kind of skeptical that’s even what he looks like. Did you notice how he looked all disheveled, even though he cast spells?”

    “Yeah.” You’re draped over the back of your desk chair, ensconced in a blanket of your own. “I thought that was weird, since his Soul was so bright.”

    “Like an Angel’s. Disguise magic, I bet. Transmutation, so it didn’t fall off, and possibly even more advanced with the voice; you heard how weird it sounded.”

    You nod. You did. You’re impressed at how well put-together you’re both acting.

    “And based on what you said about the sleeping magic, I wouldn’t be surprised if they cast something like that on the whole building; that might have been the energy you sensed at the beginning. To make sure no one would wake up.”

    “But - don’t you need a Mental connection to your target? And why didn’t I fall asleep, then?”

You can have multiple targets as long as you share the same connection with all of them. I bet they just used the simplest one - that we’re all Angels - to connect to everyone at once. That’s probably why it might have been weak enough to resist if you were already awake, since that’s a really weak connection.”

    “But I didn’t feel... anything. Not even a little drowsy.”

    “Maybe you’re really resistant to this sort of thing? I don’t know; it doesn’t matter. It could even have something to do with your Soul sensitivity, though I can’t imagine what specifically.”

    “Maybe...”

    “...”

    “... So. Erm, why... was this person... trying to kidnap you?”

    A very long pause. “I don’t know. I don’t know who they were. Are. Ugh. But if they really know who <em>I</em> am...”

    Another pause. You wait patiently.

    “You heard what he called me. Bastard child. I know that’s used a lot as just a normal curse word, but... it’s literally true for me. M-my father is...”

    Patience. She’ll get there.

    “Is...”

    She keeps stopping herself.

    “... Sorry. I’ve been keeping this a secret for my whole life. It’s really hard to just go out and... say it.”

    “It’s okay. Take your time.” You explicitly don’t say “you don’t have to tell me.” She does, at this point. You could have died. You need to know what’s going on.

    “... one of the primes.” More of a whisper, but she says it.

    “Oh. That’s... not good.”

    “You could say that, yeah.”

    Ordinary priests are discouraged from having children, but are allowed to keep any they already had before their promotion and, should they sire any even after their ordination, they usually just end up with an official censure and that’s the end of it. Sometimes a priest will be demoted or even expelled from the church, but nothing more severe than that.

For those highest ministers of the Cathedra, to flaunt the scripture in such an obvious way - giving into temptation and producing an obviously illegitimate child - is a severe sin. Dismissal is not enough. Instead...

    “If anyone knew, he’d be executed for sure. And I don’t even <em>know</em> what they’d do with me. I’m not holy enough to be an Angel; this has never happened before. They’ll probably think since I was born of regular corruption, I’ll fall to <em>the</em> corruption later. Executed. That’s the safest way. After all, you can’t trust an Angel who was literally <em>born</em> of sin.”

    “S-surely they wouldn’t go <em>that</em> far. I mean, no Angel has been executed since...” You can’t remember; you mumble something and skip past it. “A-and, you didn’t even have a choice how you were born, and God chose you anyway! There’s not even any precedent!”

    “Even if they let me live, they <em>would</em> execute my father. That’s been codified and carried out before. I can’t let that happen, if I have any choice.”

    “...” You try to imagine it happening to your dad. The blade of the guillotine glinting in the sunrise light, painted bloody orange before even serving its purpose. A high-ranking minister, dressed all in black, gloved hand on the lever. You’ve never actually seen an execution before, but you’ve heard the stories. Everyone has. It’s worse when they execute an Angel, since they often have to do it twice. You shiver, pulling the blanket closer. “I understand. I wouldn’t let that happen either.”

    She nods, voice now muffled as she still hasn’t popped back out of the blanket. “Is that enough for you to stay quiet? The person might come back later, but I’d prefer that over definitely murdering my dad by saying anything.”

    She looks away. “I don’t know. I never knew her; she’s probably just some prostitute.”

    Something about her tone strikes you as unusual. There’s almost... anger? “Is... is your dad good to you?”

    Now she’s looking at you again. “What? Of course he is; why else would I be willing to do all this to protect him?”

    “S-sorry; just something about how you responded to that last question - er, you just seemed... a little angry...”

    “Of course I’m angry! Just because he’s doing his best for me now doesn’t excuse him from putting me in this awful situation to begin with! If he’d just kept himself under control, none of this would be a problem!”

    “Sorry, s-sorry-” Something occurs to you. “How did you get back to your father if you were just some prostitute’s child? Surely you would have just been raised by-”

    “Sh-she dumped me with him, or something. I don’t know; I wasn’t even aware at the time!”

    You risk it. You’re too warm and too tired; even though you <em>know</em> you shouldn’t press her like this - it’s insensitive, it’s baseless, it’s plain mean - something just doesn’t make sense.

    “Naoriel, you know your mom wasn’t a prostitute. Was she?”

    “...” A strange expression. Fear, perhaps, but also... almost relief? “No,” she says quietly. “She isn’t.”

    “-” The next question sticks in your throat. The moment is exactly right; Naoriel will answer if you press her. She’s too tired and emotionally drained to resist. All you have to do is ask.

    But...

    <em>Scene 74</em>
    “...” It’s... not your place to ask. You’ve already gotten more than enough information; if she wants to tell you, she’ll do so in the morning when she’s more awake. “Okay,” you say. “It’s good that you know.”

    And that’s the end of that.

    You do end up getting some sleep after all, dozing off in the main room at some point and eventually getting up late when one of the bells for morning mass finally wakes you up. The two of you decide to go to evening mass instead of rushing for the morning one, then spend some time cleaning up Naoriel’s room while everyone else is out.

    No one seems to have noticed anything weird last night, which is both convenient and concerning. Now having slept on it, you do ask Naoriel once if she’s sure she really wants to keep quiet about it, but she stands firm. She’s not going to risk getting her father in trouble; she can handle whatever this mystery person will try next. Admirable, though you’re not sure it’s smart.

    But it’s her decision to make, so you’ll support her.

    ...

    Nothing really happens for the rest of the month. Naoriel doesn’t bring up anything that happened on that night, though she does sometimes mention a tidbit or two about various Angels who were somewhere specific then and couldn’t have been involved. Clearly, she’s not just pretending it didn’t happen; she’s doing her own investigation. Unfortunately, it’s difficult to prove anything conclusively since nearly all the full Angels were out in the city, on their own, without any real way to provide a solid alibi. And asking around too obviously would get suspicious quickly. You quietly doubt anything will come of it until and unless the mystery person returns.

You prompt her a few times, but she really seems to be cautious around you now. Like you’re made of glass. You know the feeling from back in your childhood; even though you’re so much stronger now, people still consider you fragile. You mention it once or twice, and she’ll mostly go back to normal for a few days, but not for much longer. You’re not sure what to do about that. It feels like you’re not as close as you were before that duel, but you don’t really know how to fix it. You’re not fighting or anything; there’s no argument to resolve.

    Eventually, someone finally notices that none of the trainees have started preparing the “something” for the festival and gets to organizing. This is when you finally get to meet the mysterious third years (now fourth years, it’s been so long), Emmet and Rhysa, with more than a passing glance. They seem to be pretty close. Emmet’s got kind of round features; Rhysa has a really floofy ponytail. You don’t know her well enough to ask how she gets it that way. Possibly magic, or a lot of prep time in the morning.

    Anyway, the “something” will apparently be pretty simple: you’re just going to be working an ordinary city job for the two days before the festival in order to give back to those you serve. It fits in with the typical theming of the month - similar to the Sulday of Charity earlier - but it does seem a little lacking in imagination. Though given that you now have less than a full week left before the festival, that does make sense.

    Since there are ten of you and fewer than ten different jobs that are able to accept trainees on such short notice, you’re going to be paired up and sent off to your temporary assignments. And, because it couldn’t get any less planned-out, you’re being paired up randomly.

Great. Fantastic. You can’t think of anyone else you’d rather spend two full days with out in the city, except for, you know, <em>any other trainee.</em> Oh well. You tried being positive to him earlier, but kind of gave up after a while and accepted that you just don’t like him. You’ll live. As long as the two of you don’t get anything too strenuous or demeaning, he probably won’t complain too much.

    Ah. Excellent. Your luck is top quality today, because you drew “caving.” Erich immediately sighs when you show him the slip of paper. At least you avoided the “sanitation” one that would have you assisting in the water and sewage pipes beneath the streets. <em>That</em> particular job went to... Yara and Etalyn. Really? They got paired together? Is this thing rigged? It’s just a bowl of paper, but...

    Well, whatever. The caving slip means you’ll be sent down into the vast network of caverns beneath the city, harvesting edible mushrooms from the top levels or descending deeper to hunt for spiny shelled creatures and map out more of the network for future expeditions. It’s what most of Serri’s family does, so she pops over to give you a few bits of advice beforehand.

    “It’s a lot wetter down there than you’d expect,” she informs you. “So make sure you really pay attention when they teach you how to seal your boots and gloves and stuff. Also, don’t go into any pools deeper than your overalls, since most of them are full of worms and bugs and stuff.”

    “... Thanks...”

    “I knew I should have picked the slip instead.”

    “Oh! Also, don’t touch your face after touching any plants down there except for ones you definitely know what they are. My sister did that once and her cheeks swelled up for days afterwards. It was really funny, except it was also really painful. So not really that funny, actually.”

    <em>Scene 75</em>
    Gate, station, train, station, gate. It doesn’t take all that long to make your way out to the cavern entrance where you’ll be working for the next two days. You and Erich don’t really talk much on the way there, though at least there is a monk accompanying you so it’s not terribly awkward. Just moderately so.

    Nor does it take very long to meet your hosts - you try but fail to catch anyone’s name as the train starts pulling away at exactly the wrong time with a chorus of hissing steam - or get suited up in the drab brown outfits designed for work in the caves. It’s a weird kind of dissonance to see Erich in such plain, untidy (though clearly recently washed) attire - he’s usually so fastidious about his appearance. You’re sure your own appearance is strange as well, but there aren’t any mirrors here so you can’t tell for sure. The fabric is rough and not very breathable; of course not, as it’s supposed to be mostly waterproof. It’s not very comfortable. You’re used to finer clothes now.

    But it does do the job. The supervisor has you both wade through a deep puddle to test the seals, and thankfully you’ve both done them well enough to emerge dry. Then that’s it; it’s time to go underground. You take one more look around the area - just a small cleared section along the rails between the still-dense buildings of the city - and descend into the earth.

Well, basements and such, but not <em>really</em> belowground. Daylight from above gets lost in merely a few turns, leaving you with only the supervisor’s helmet-mounted light that seems to operate similar to a mechanical lamp. You wonder how it can still produce light without an obvious source of steam, but he doesn’t know how it works either. He just has to connect it to a pipe aboveground to recharge, then it’s good for a few hours at least. Of course, neither you nor Erich need any lights, as you can simply release your glows and illuminate the caverns with your Souls. The supervisor comments how useful that would be for the ordinary folks who work here normally, then continues on.

    A dirty wooden elevator shaft looms open to your left, connecting to one of the buildings upstairs, but you aren’t using it today. That one descends to the deeper areas, where unexplored passages still teem with unknown creatures. No, today you’ll be staying up here in the mushroom fields. Much safer. The Cathedra certainly wouldn’t appreciate it if any of their trainees never returned. The mood is all wrong for that joke. Some of the others you pass eye you with a glare somewhere between suspicion and resentment. That’s new. You don’t feel very divine down here, singled out by your glow and your appearance.

They’re about a foot and a half in diameter, maybe a quarter of that thick, and resemble semi-melted pats of cracked, grey skin. The supervisor demonstrates how to tell if they’re ready for harvest (by the texture and firmness, primarily), how to pull one out of the ground (use a gentle twisting motion, pulling just around the hidden stalk beneath the bulbous cap), how to remove and discard the lower portion (with a knife), and how to pack them efficiently for transport (there’s a specialized wire basket with some built-in racks to stack them like extremely unappetizing pancakes). He also breaks one open so you can see the thick, off-white interior. Apparently they’re surprisingly nutritious and taste almost like flour-based products when prepared properly.

    You wonder if you were actually quite privileged, even before you became an Angel. You’ve never had to understand any of this; your parents always bought normal food, not these weird mushrooms. Well, normal to you. To some people, given how cheap they are for how many people they can feed, these mushrooms would be the norm, not ordinary bread. “Ordinary.” You’re doing it again.

    Anyway, after some time working on the nearby patch with the supervisor correcting you occasionally, he seems satisfied, asks you to finish harvesting this patch and the one next to it, then come back up for a break. And then he leaves.

    You’re not alone down here; there are plenty of other people around harvesting, carrying, or tending to the fungi. But most of them tend to avoid you. No one’s sure how to act around an Angel just... farming, like a normal person. And there are still those occasional people with the glares that make you very uncomfortable. Hyper-aware of your glow. Why are they so upset? You’re just here to help them, and even in your normal duties that doesn’t change. You protect them. That’s your job. That’s your purpose.

    “Wh - no? Why would - nevermind. I just wanted to ask if you noticed those people staring at us.”

    <em>Scene 76</em>
    “...” The stares. No, this isn’t worth it. You doubt he’d have anything to say you’d want to hear, anyway. “N-nevermind.”

    “Really? You <em>just</em> wanted to know that?” A pause; you shrug nervously. “Fine, whatever. Get back to work, then.”

    Whew. Normal workers lose interest and turn away after a few more moments, leaving you to just your thoughts and the mushrooms. Still, you’re now hyper-aware of not just your glow, but its effect on everyone nearby. People still glance at you, even without pointedly staring, far more than you’re used to. Like when you came back to school after your sickness receded. You haven’t had to deal with that since you Ascended; Angels are common in the Cathedra and you’ve always been disguised outside of it.

    Those glares persist. Not as unbroken as when you had mentioned it to Erich, but there are still glimpses out of the corner of your eye. When they think you aren’t looking, unaware of the heightened senses that came with your changed Body and Mind. Most people just seem curious - being able to watch an Angel for such an extended period of time is highly unusual - but those glares...

    What are they thinking?

    Almost without realizing it, you begin to attune your Soul to the Mind aspect. It takes you the normal half a minute again; you’ve never been able to reproduce the near-instant switches from that night with Naoriel and the intruder. She didn’t have any real ideas either when you mentioned it, and it’s not like you can ask anyone. You did have the thought that maybe it was just <em>her</em>, acting as some sort of magic-enhancer, but a few different experiments trying to reproduce the scenario didn’t seem to work at all. Maybe you need to be in actual peril for it to work. You’re not sure; it remains yet another mystery on the pile.

Of course, that means you’re making slower progress in both, but you do at least get where she’s coming from. Internal Mind projection involves bolstering your own Mind against intrusion, primarily, which is why you picked it. You wanted to be sure your thoughts are your own. But there’s limited impact you can have on the world or your opponents like that. The corruption will attack your Mind, but you won’t be facing it for real for years to come. It’s a good idea to also build a skill you can use in more flexible ways.

    Denn agreed with her assessment as well; you had almost forgotten when you were choosing your focus with Yara, Serri, and Etalyn, but Denn is focusing on much the same path as you’ve chosen. You don’t meet up with him all that often (for some reason, he hangs out with Erich a lot!) but he’s still given you some tips about the techniques he’s found most useful to practice.

    So the point is that you’ve started working on being able to sense thoughts and emotions in those around you, while avoiding getting overwhelmed yourself. It’s not exactly a combination of external and internal magic (you can only focus on one target at a time, and this one’s external) but a lot of the internal principles do apply to keep from getting lost in others’ feelings.

    Okay. Deep breath, form the connection. Mind magic requires a Mental connection, but that’s simple enough here. You can use the work; the feelings of plucking mushrooms from the mucky dirt. Your thoughts about the job almost certainly aren’t the same as the others’, but there’s enough commonality to make the bond. Now... release. Open your senses. Listen.

    “...”

Lanterns in the distance, distractingly bright and flickery. Glitzy; glamorous. These caverns are deep. So deep that the bottom has never been found, nor even fathomed. Just tunnels after tunnels, winding their twisting way down into the corruption-festering bedrock below.

    ... Some of those may have been your thoughts. You pull back, letting the lingering magic disperse into the air. One of the grumbly guys looks up briefly, as if confused. Maybe he felt your touch? Even though it was so light? You hope not; he doesn’t need any more reasons to dislike you.

    That... wasn’t really helpful at all. The only thing you learned wasn’t really new; just remembering that the earth itself is corrupted. How far down would you have to go before the ground starts to hate you? Is the entire city sitting atop a mire of darkness? What’s stopping it from flooding up from tunnels unknown and rising to walk the city streets?

    ... You, presumably.

    Well, not only did you fail to learn anything, now you’re nervous about that open elevator shaft just a few tunnels over. Imagining some nebulous miasma of darkness rising from the depths to strike you down...

    Oh, you’re done with the mushrooms. Time to head back up.

    <em>Scene 77</em>
    The rest of the day isn’t as bad once you’ve gotten used to it. The promised break that you don’t physically need grants you an opportunity to wander the small area above and watch as workers load stacks of mushrooms onto a cargo train. Discreetly. You don’t know how they’d react to being observed, and you don’t mean anything by it. You’re just curious. This sort of thing is new to you.

    No one really approaches you, including Erich. He seems content to just sit in a corner and grumble to himself while you poke around. It’s interesting how even the wispy, woody vines growing along the fence still produce little bluish berries. Every plant in the city needs to grow <em>something</em> edible, you know, but you sorta figured that rule only applied to things people planted purposefully. Although you suppose it’s possible that the vines are here on purpose.

    The afternoon goes more smoothly than the morning. The work isn’t any different - there’s a lot of mushrooms to harvest - with the exception that you also have to tend to the ones that are still growing. It’s not hard; you’re well aware that fungi can grow anywhere, especially a place as dark and damp as this cave. No, all you have to do is sprinkle some fertilizer around, check to make sure the soil is nice and moist, and add a touch of water if it isn’t. Oh, and make sure there aren’t any pests or weeds getting too close.

    You sorta get into it after a while, tending to the little ones that aren’t yet ready and extracting the bigger ones that are. It’s kinda soothing. But you can definitely understand how this job would get monotonous after doing it for weeks, or months, or years. For you, it’s a nice break from your daily routine. For the workers who do this for a living, it <em>is</em> their daily routine.

A few other workers who are waiting for a different train have to stand there and watch as your train blocks theirs (idling just down the tracks), since there’s only one platform at this station. You try to hurry up to minimize the disruption.

    The trainees catch up at dinner and trade stories about everyone’s jobs. Yara and Etalyn, working in sanitation, were spared from the dirtiest work by their supervisor, who seemed about ready to faint at the thought of sending Angels to go clean anything worse than a fresh water pipe. Naoriel had ended up with Emmett as attendants at one of the main train stations downtown. They spent some time sorting letters and cargo and such, and some time in a ticket office. Every customer got a surprise at the window that day. Serri and Rhysa, meanwhile, worked in delivery at the same station as Naoriel and Emmett, helping to move supplies from bulk trains to local carriages and vice versa. Rhysa is apparently pretty adept at levitating objects, so she was extremely popular with the workers there. And finally, there hadn’t been enough unique jobs for everyone, so Denn and Sims spent the day similarly to Naoriel, Emmett, Serri, and Rhysa, but at a different station.

Although, when you bring that up, Yara’s quick to point out that everyone else had been in public or at least close to it. Sanitation work takes place in the city streets, and the various station people were either working directly with the public or within plain view on cargo platforms just across from the passenger ones. You and Erich were just down in the caverns all day with no one but the other workers around.

    “But why would they dislike us?” you say, though you already have an idea. “We’re just there to help, and that doesn’t change even once we go back to our normal jobs. I’ve never met anyone who isn’t grateful that Angels are here to protect the city.”

    Glances here and there. Some of the trainees seem to be considering it, like they aren’t quite sure either. Some, however, are just deciding how best to phrase the answer.

    <em>Scene 78</em>
    “They hate us because we’re better off than them.” Emmett, surprisingly. You haven’t really talked to him much (at all). Predictably, most of the group turns to him for some sort of elaboration.

    “It’s obvious, isn’t it? We didn’t ‘do’ anything to earn our spots here at the Cathedra; we were simply chosen by God in our Callings. And just look at all the fabulous benefits we get for that ‘nothing.’ Immortality. Magic. Enhanced Bodies and Minds. To say nothing of the actual living arrangements. From the outside, the training and work we do is hidden. As is the danger we put ourselves in every day to defend the city and its population. But even with that, wouldn’t you say the rewards are worth it?”

    You think about that.

    And you keep thinking about it through the rest of the night. Most of the Angels had agreed. Serri hadn’t said anything, but she didn’t <em>dis</em>agree. A few others stayed quiet as well, and the conversation quickly pivoted so not everyone got to weigh in, but the general mood was “yes.” Being an Angel is worth it. Right?

    ... What happens when you die?

    It’s a question that the church answers, by default, in a perfectly ordinary way. Your Soul is the core of “you,” not your Body or Mind. So when your Body dies and your Mind goes with it, your Soul lingers and is eventually incorporated back into another human being. The circle of life. You don’t remember the previous lives you’ve lived, since memories are stored in your Mind. But sometimes, particularly vivid or important details get seared into your Soul and you might find yourself having moments of strange familiarity. It makes sense. It’s a clean, happy cycle.

    But the Cathedra doesn’t always tell the full truth during normal mass.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1217650059135418478 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1217650059135418478><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 13, 2024 9:46 PM">9:46 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Souls can be corrupted. That’s what the corruption <em>is.</em> And you know that, if a human is corrupted too much, things start to unravel. The Soul can fracture; decay; crumble. It’s possible to destroy a Soul. And if that’s the case, that cycle of reincarnation starts to break down. If you die in a normal manner, uncorrupted, it still works. Your Soul drifts off and returns later.

    But Angels don’t die normally. You never age. You never get sick. You can’t be killed by ordinary means unless you make a serious mistake. And that means that - when your death inevitably arrives - it will be at the hands of the corruption. Soul worn away at the edge of death, despite your resistance. Splintered, broken. Is there any coming back from that? Do you, in exchange for your Angelic immortality, sacrifice your even more permanent immortality of reincarnation?

    Or is all of this a lie? Experiments done in the fourth century, you recall, showed that the Soul decays within hours to days after its Body’s death. Later scientists determined that the Soul actually moved on - it wasn’t destroyed - but... moves on to where? You can observe Souls. They’re not some nebulous, invisible presence that you just have to believe exists (at least, not for you; ordinary people do have to do that). So if a Soul vanishes from your sight... where does it go? Surely the simplest explanation is that it no longer exists. That it’s destroyed. That there <em>is</em> no rebirth, and this one life is all you get.

    Which makes your immortality even more valuable. And the danger you will be subjected to even more perilous.

    As with so many things, there’s no way to be sure.

    ...

    The next day isn’t anything special. You don’t go down into the depths where the corruption may lurk; you just tend to more fungus in the shallow caves. More grumbles from Erich and some, but not many, of the other workers.

You would never have to deal with a wound like that; at least, not for long. Emmett’s words echo. The injured man grins as one of the others points you out, giving a little wave. You’re surprised enough that you waste several seconds trying to figure out if you know him (you don’t) and by the time you gather yourself enough to wave back, he’s already turned away.

    ...

    Everything seems more abstract in the snow. The mist is heavy. You’ve been feeling a little disconnected lately, thinking thoughts as heavy as the mist while lying in bed and not really fully <em>being</em> in the waking world. You don’t know if you’ve really learned anything from your work these last two days. Maybe you just need something exciting to do. A distraction; something you’ve been looking forward to.

    The festival starts tomorrow, of course. Day of Body, Day of Mind, Day of Soul. And then it’s the end of the year and the start of a new one with the Calling ceremony on the very first day. You’ve made plans, haven’t you? What were they again?

    <em>Scene 79</em>
    Oh, that’s right. It was this whole thing a few days ago.

    “Sorry, Jessamine; I’ve already got plans for then. I can do the Day of Mind, though.”

    “Yeah, I figured you might. I already tried Clarity too, before you ask, but she’s going out with her new full Angel friends and won’t have time.”

    “Ah, that’s how it is once you graduate, is it? I suppose I’ll have my own excuses in a year as well. Goodness, you had better learn disguise magic quickly or you’ll never get to go out again!”

    You pout at the floor, more for Yara’s benefit than because you’re actually upset. “Cobb won’t approve it until I’m a second year at minimum. Need to be more mature, he said.”

    “Mature? Has Cobb <em>met</em> you?”

    “Heh. Thanks, but I get what he means. If I can disguise myself, I can just leave on my own whenever. Well, during holidays, at least. It might be a little risky if I go off without anyone else.”

    “Hmm. Well, I can give you a single charge before you head out again, but you’ll need to find somewhere out of public to spend the rest of the day before it wears off. I don’t suppose you were planning on going home again?”

    “No, I was actually going to the big festival. You know, the one that couldn’t be any more public if it tried.”

    Yara raises one inquisitive eyebrow. “You’re not being sarcastic, young lady?”

    “Afraid not. I’ve only been to the smaller district ones; I was ‘too fragile’ to go to the main one downtown.”

    “Mmm.” He ponders this for a minute, not remarking on your “too fragile” comment. You’re grateful for that; Yara doesn’t seem to be treating you any differently after word of your sickness inevitably spread around. Unlike some people you could mention.

Which, thankfully, it seems like Yara can accompany you then as well. She’s been kinda avoiding you for a while and spending a lot of time practicing combat out in the snow, so it was a relief that she didn’t turn you down again. You’re still not sure why she’s seemingly so mad at you, given you haven’t had an argument or anything. But, there was your collapse at the duel and her outburst just before that, so... Yeah. Things are still a little weird between you.

    “Why don’t you try just wearing a good scarf?”

    “... You’re joking.”

    “No, no! It’s cold enough no one will find it strange; you can cover up most everything but your eyes under the guise of defense against winter! Just don’t let anyone stare at you for too long-” He widens his eyes and leans a little closer for emphasis. “- and you should be fine! The festival’s too busy for anyone to pay much attention to you anyway.”

    “That sounds... super against the rules.”

    “Why? Because we’re using normal technology for a disguise instead of magic? I daresay it serves exactly the same purpose! In fact, if you read the text of the so-called  ‘rules’ in depth...”

    “Wait, why do you have that book already prepared? Were you just carrying it around in case you had an opportunity to-”

    “You will see that the clause in question only specifies you must be ‘disguised such that the Angel’s divine aspect appears ordinarily human,’ making no reference to specific disguise magic.”

    “But the guards at the gate always check for spells.”

    “Tradition! Of course, disguise magic is quite good at what it does, but if you want to get out of here for the Day of Body, I’m afraid it’s either this or find another friend who can keep an active external transmutation up for most of the day. And such individuals are somewhat hard to find, as I’m certain you’re aware.”

I am...” Really. Out of all the trainees, only Yara (and formerly Clarity) can do it. More full Angels can, but you don’t know any of them well enough to ask them to spend a festival day hanging out with you. Right? Right.

    “Don’t worry!” he assures you. “If anything goes wrong, just show them the rulebook and say you figured it was fully allowed. I’m certain they’ll have to let you off in order to rewrite the text.”

    “Are you <em>sure</em> about that? Because the last time you were certain about a rule-”

    “Listen, I <em>already admitted</em> that the negated exception clause was <em>actually</em> inverted, and I <em>already replaced</em> the entire shrubbery. You were there.”

    You allow yourself a few chuckles at his expense, but no more. He’s right, of course. “Promise you’re not messing with me?”

    “Here; read it yourself! Clearly I cannot be trusted with this sort of interpretation!”

    The book reads as he described. There’s no mention of magic. “I’ll... think about it.”

    “And I shall, of course, be willing to provide initial disguises to get you past the guards should you so desire. Just in case they don’t share the same interpretation of the text.”

    You narrow your eyes at him. “That doesn’t sound very confident.”

    “Fine! No magic whatsoever! Goodness, the nerve of young trainees these days.”

    You spent a little longer plotting your not-so-elaborate escape from the Cathedra grounds with Yara, then checked with Naoriel to see if she wanted to come.

    And that’s how you got here, standing just beyond the Cathedra’s train station in the misty winter sunlight. It’s the Day of Body, Naoriel’s bundled up in similar winter clothes next to you, and Yara’s initial disguise magic is starting to fade. The streets are busy even here, but they’ll be <em>packed</em> downtown. You’re excited, but also very nervous. You and Naoriel kinda pushed each other to get this far, but now you’re running a little low on courage. Is it <em>really</em> okay to be doing this? It may be obeying the letter of the rules, but...

    <em>Scene 80</em>
    “So,” you begin a little bit later, now well onto the main road leading downtown. You decided to keep going. “You can’t do disguise magic either?”

    It’s kind of weird talking to Naoriel like this; you can only see her eyes. Her strangely purple eyes that will totally give her away, now that you think about it. Maybe she can pretend they’re just weird, frameless, really small colored glasses? That doesn’t even make sense. “Nope. I considered it, but transmutation isn’t as easy as you might think. I’m sure I’ll have to learn it eventually, but for now, projection is sufficient.”

    “Hmm. You know, I still don’t know how you learned all this or why you didn’t take the basic magic course. Are you even allowed to take the later ones without it?”

    “I’ll be fine.”

    “... Still not going to explain, then?”

    “C’mon, Jess, you should know better by now. It’s part of my charm.” A somewhat silly-looking motion that you assume is a wink if you could see her properly. “But these more physical disguises should work just fine too. I mean, look at everyone else.”

    She’s right; it’s pretty cold today. Although most people aren’t <em>quite</em> as bundled up as you two, it’s not far off. You pass as people who are just really cold without too much issue. Well, except for... “What about your eyes?”

    “Hm? What about them?”

    “... They’re purple. How long have you been transmuting them to forget that you’re - wait a minute, you just said transmutation’s too hard. Are they... <em>natural?”</em>

    “...”

    “How were you born with <em>naturally purple</em> eyes?! That’s not even possible! I think.”

    “C-clearly it is. Maybe they’re from my mother’s side. I wouldn’t know.”

After you stopped just short of making her admit that she knows her mom’s identity, Naoriel went right back to pretending she has no idea. It’s obviously still a touchy subject for her, and you’re not out to grill her again. At least, not today. You’d better drop it. “Yeah, maybe. Sorry.” At this point, the crowd is getting thick enough that you shouldn’t be talking about this stuff anyway.

    The Day of Body is, as one might expect, a festival day focused on the aspect of Body. Specifically, that means a variety of physical performances and contests (from dance to swordfighting and everything between) as well as various souvenirs designed to act upon the Body. Chefs trial strange new dishes and bring out old favorites, gearworkers produce prototype machines for soothing, physical protection, or enhancement, and Angels (though not as many as on the Sulday of Charity a few weeks back) provide healing and, occasionally, cosmetic services. You know none of the changes away from a person’s template will be permanent, but it can still be fun for a kid to wander around with bright green hair for a day, for instance. Not that you’ve done that. Seth did.

    And then of course some parents complained to a priest about using God’s divine powers for something so trivial. The Angel who did it must have been reprimanded, since that was the last year he cast anything like that.

The mist seems to be thin today; you can see all the way across to the buildings on the other side. Train bells ring nonstop from the station - service frequency is way up for the festival days as everyone is traveling around the city - and strings of festive lights decorate the administrative offices. You have no idea how they get the lights to work like that; there’s no way it can be traditional fire, and if it’s mechanical, where are the pipes? Or maybe they’re just reflective and not actual lights. It is pretty bright out right now.

    “What do you want to do first?” you half-shout to Naoriel. It’s so loud that you’re having to apply some techniques from your Mind course to filter out the background as best you can. “I haven’t been to this main one before, so is there anything really good?”

    “I haven’t been either! I thought you were leading!”

    Ah. Whoops. “Maybe that thing?” There’s a large stage set up near the center of the square. Though you can’t make out what’s going on from here, even just getting that far will give you plenty of opportunities to get distracted with stuff along your path. “And see what’s interesting on the way?”

    You get an agreement, so off you go. Pushing into the crowd, weaving between all sorts of people. Using your smaller stature and Angelic strength to your advantage to slip into gaps and avoid being pushed back. It only takes you a minute to work out the tricks; you’re somewhat familiar with large crowds from occasional trips to the station.

It stood out to you because they’re using the same little blue berries you spotted on the vine near that fungus farm, squashing them in a human-powered press and then mixing and adding a blend of spices before heating over a fire and serving. It’s a complicated operation to pull off in the small space afforded, especially with the open flame. Is that safe, really? Either way, apparently you look young enough to count for the kids’ free samples and walk away with a little covered mug each.

    By this point, Yara’s magic has worn off and your nervousness spikes. No one’s paying much attention, but... how are you supposed to drink this without pulling down your scarf to expose your face? You clearly can’t do that, so how...? Maybe if you sorta loosen it a little, you can slip in <em>under</em> it? Naoriel helps develop a technique, making sure you’re still covered up as you manage to take a sip and nearly burn your tongue. Then you help her with the same task, thankfully allowing the drinks to cool while you work out the details.

    The end result only looks a little silly, though it is definitely quite warm. Your scarf is now suffused with the scent of whatever the blue berry drink is actually called (the berry has to have an actual name besides just “blue berry” - that’d be way too lazy). It’s pretty good. A little tangy. Very warm. You’d already be sweating if you weren’t also resistant to heat. How do normal people deal with stuff like this? You’re already beginning to forget.

    No, probably not. There’ll be more stuff later, and you’re already getting distracted by a demonstration area along the way.

    There’s a small fenced-off zone in the square containing two men in stout coats, a strange-looking backpack that one of them is putting on with the help of the other, and a few large rocks. A third man outside the zone is explaining what’s about to happen to a number of spectators. You sneak a little bit closer on your way past to hear.

    The men are gearworkers (which makes sense; those coats look similar to your dad’s) and they’re demonstrating a new prototype device that’s designed to augment a worker’s own strength with that of steam-fueled pistons. The power source lies within a heavily insulated backpack and connects to a pair of arm braces made of gleaming polished brass. They seem to be tailoring the speech towards business owners or supervisors - a lot of the details involve how cost-effective it can be or how much time it can save workers. A number of the spectators seem to be well-dressed middle-aged men. You almost decide to just leave, but you are kinda curious how it works.

    The gearworker wearing the backpack clicks it on and flexes his arms in a few different angles, showing that the skeleton-like frame moves easily with him. He picks up some small tools and writes a few sentences, to show that it doesn’t impact manual dexterity. Then, he reaches down around the rock and, with a little hiss from the backpack, manages to pick it up with some effort. The man outside the fence clarifies that he already tried this earlier without the device - before you showed up, it seems - and was unable to lift it. Then, he sets it down again, adjusts a dial on the backpack to change the machine’s mode, pulls back, and slams his fist into the rock.

The man pulls back, showing his unharmed hand. The machine somehow absorbed the force of the blow on his arm, and heightened it on the rock. That’s pretty cool, and you’d like to know how it works, but unfortunately you’re just not as good at this stuff as your dad. For obvious reasons, since he’s a professional and you haven’t even studied gearworking to any significant degree.

    Just in case you were wondering, you’re not allowed to try the thing on. Although you sure are curious how it’d work with your enhanced strength.

    ... It probably wouldn’t be all that impressive, honestly. You may be strong for your frame, but you’re still not as strong as, for instance, just a regular adult man like the guy who had just used it. Maybe if you had Body enhancement magic it would be a different story.

    There’s a seemingly-endless parade of additional distractions on your way to the main stage. Naoriel notices a strange selection of hats and clothes based on mushroom-like designs; a little odd in winter, and it’s not like you can try much on properly, but you still have fun giggling at each other in the floppy hats that droop almost enough to cover your faces even without the scarves.

    You’re caught up in a free sample event for some sort of steamed meat bun thing, and between the two of you have to figure out how to try and eat them without giving anything away or getting too messy. That’s a real struggle, but the floppy hats come in handy to shield you from prying eyes. (Naoriel bought one. What is she going to do with a hat that large? Also, where did she get the money?)

    Astonishingly, the mushroom hat is actually collapsible to some degree, folding up so she doesn’t have to look like a maniac for the rest of the day. You ask if she noticed that before buying it, and... yeah, she did. Would have been funny if she had simply been willing to put up with the thing at full size just for fun, though.

A slapstick theater performance that you’re very impressed can still be both comprehensible and funny in just the minute or two you spend watching. A group of acrobats careening around a series of metal poles on glistening ribbons as if they were flying. Two young dancers, so in sync they can move nearly within the same space without hitting each other.

    And more and more beyond that too; you hardly make it a few steps past the last distraction before coming across something new. It seems like it takes you hours to finally make it to the main stage, and you actually can’t disprove that. You didn’t check to see when you started. But at last, you climb up a few rows of elevated seats to see what everyone was so excited about. Or, potentially, something entirely different after that first thing was over. It took you quite a while to get here, after all.

    It’s a swordfight. You’re just barely in time to catch the end of it, where one of the combatants <s>skewers</s> strikes the other in the stomach with their definitely-not-real practice sword, and that’s the end of it. Some of the crowd cheer; some groan; the referee calls the match. And you and Naoriel look at each other with an almost identical expression.

    “So that’s where all those demonstration matches are,” she comments first.

    Some of them, at least. Yes, the winner of the match is none other than Etalyn, disguised as an ordinary human and bowing to the crowd before helping her opponent up and bowing again together.

    “I had no idea that was even allowed. It doesn’t seem fair; is her opponent an A - oop!” You cover your mouth before finishing that slip-up in the midst of a huge crowd. “Er, do you think they’re evenly matched?”

    <em>Scene 82</em>
    “I’ll ask later,” you decide. “I kinda doubt she’d be out here fighting, er, <em>people</em>, but it’ll make me feel better to know that for sure.”

    “Mm h - hey, isn’t that Yara?”

    “Where? He said he was busy today; what’s he doing here?”

    “Just over there by the side... see, with Etalyn?”

    “Ah ha!” Yep, it’s pretty obvious when you finally pick out the right section of the crowd. You can’t quite make out what they’re doing from this distance, not with all the people in the way, but it’s clear they’re at least here together. In fact, given that he turned you down when you obviously could have come with him, it almost seems like... “Serri’s gonna be so mad she missed this.”

    “Huh? Why?”

    “Well-”

    You only get a little ways into your explanation of <em>that</em> whole deal before the stage starts switching over to the next performance. Since you just got here and enough people are leaving or shuffling around to actually get a seat instead of leaning precariously on the railing, you decide to just stay put and watch whatever the next thing is. Which, you find out quickly, is a play. Specifically, it’s a somewhat abridged version of <em>False Angel Erejil</em>, the definitive work on the tragedies and unrest surrounding the titular (false) Angel’s life and death. You’ve never seen it (only read excerpts from it for Brother Trigg’s history course) so you’re on board with staying to watch it. Naoriel seems a little uncomfortable with the subject matter (it is a little gory, that’s for sure), but you convince her after a minute and settle down to watch.

In the abridged version, much of the details from his childhood or training are removed, save for the beginnings of an unhealthy obsession with understanding the corruption. Young Erejil clashed with his mentors several times before eventually learning to better hide his views - not abandoning them.

    Later, as a full Angel deployed to the wastelands, Erejil came into contact with a shade. A shade who, somehow, seemed to know of him and his dangerous ways of thinking. A shade who, instead of fighting, made a deal. Erejil would help it defeat Angels who ventured into the wastelands. In exchange, he would learn of the corruption. As much as he desired. An incredibly lopsided deal, but at this point Erejil’s brow was already cast in shadow and his wings darkened to a pale, sickly grey. You doubt he actually had wings at all - he was only supposed to be in his late twenties here and most Angels take decades to manifest them - but you suppose there’s some artistic liberty that can be taken without affecting the plot too much.

    He accepted. Angels died. Some received worse fates. The gore has been turned down for this rendition, but some of it is still enough to make you want to look away. You’re surprised they can get away with this - there are kids in the audience! - but... it’s important to be uncomfortable about this. Maybe. You certainly don’t want to repeat his mistakes. Is that it? ... Man, viewing the full version would be a painful experience. Maybe that was the playwright’s point?

    ... Naoriel’s sure turned her opinion around by now. You glance over a few times and she’s always paying close attention.

The stage lighting grows darker as Erejil descends into madness. Even with his Angelic resistance, constant exposure has worn his Mind down to the point where he agrees to sabotage the wall. A single quick, bloody execution of a fellow Angel. Another escapes just in time, dying once in midair from a burst of corrupt magic, but recovering enough to fly to the Cathedra to raise help. The shade from before leads an army of Mindless darkness, but is met by a vanguard of Archangels.

    By the end of that night, portions of the city fall in shambles and dozens of Angels lie dead in the streets they sacrificed themselves to defend. Erejil himself is captured, brought before the Emissary, and stripped of his powers. At that point, the corruption festering within him takes over and, in a matter of hours, he is executed before he can fully descend. Descend(?)

    The actor playing the then-Emissary then emerges onto stage in a single spotlight (when did it get so dark?) and narrates the epilogue. Erejil changed the rules. Shades had never appeared before that day, and from then on, they continue to plague the city with scheming darkness. Future Emissaries pay careful attention to any new Angels to ensure no one can repeat the same story. To this day, they have succeeded. There has never been another breach of the same magnitude. And, God willing, there never will be.

    The corruption’s sole purpose is to destroy us utterly. It will lie and scheme and say whatever you want to hear in order to further that goal. Never, ever, listen.

    A bow. Applause. The performance was very well done, you have to admit. Some details don’t seem to match up with other tellings of the Erejil story you’ve heard - sometimes the Emissary detects his corruption, sometimes it’s the escaped Angel; stuff like that - and you’re not entirely sure what it has to do with Body, but it’s still gripping regardless.

    “Hey, it’s probably time to go. Don’t want to stay out too late. Did you like it?”

    “...”

    That’s a really weird expression. But - due to the scarf - you have no hope of knowing what it is. All you can see are her eyes! “Er-”

    “Yeah, we should go.” She stands, turning away and messing with her scarf. You only catch up near the base of the stands, where she continues talking like you hadn’t just had to chase her down. “It was a good telling of Erejil. Unfortunately, I’ve never really liked the story. Too... grim.”

    “I - I’m sorry; you should have said - we could have gone somewhere else!” <em>Why was she watching so closely if she didn’t like it?</em>

    “No, no... It’s been a while. I wanted to see it again.”

    “A while? How long ago? Do they really show it to really young kids?”

    “It... it wasn’t... ugh! P-pretend I didn’t say that. Okay?”

    “... Was it your dad?”

    “Jess! That’s the <em>opposite</em> of what I just said to do!”

    You cover your mouth (scarf) with your hands. You’ve done it again, just like when you first arrived at the festival. “Sorry! The questions just slip out!”

    “...”

    You stay quiet too. Right at the end! You were having such a good time!

    “... Sorry. It’s... yeah, it was him. It’s just... not easy to talk about. You know?”

    “You don’t have to-”

    “To be honest, it’s almost a relief that someone found out. Trying to stay quiet about it, well, <em>forever</em> is... not easy.”

Yeah.” <em>It must have been some Cathedra thing. Her father is an important minister; maybe he needed to... do, er, something with the play.</em> Even in your thoughts, you can’t quite make it make sense. But it’s close; the idea of a connection is there.

    “Well, whatever. We probably should go before it gets too late. The streets can be dangerous after dark, you know.”

    “... Don’t try to scare me like that; it won’t work! Besides, we’re only going a few blocks.”

    “I’m just getting you back for the scaryyyyy play. And you never knowwwww; with all the confusion out tonight, someone may just try to...”

    She’s grinning under there; you just know it. You honestly didn’t think Naoriel’d be the type to try and scare you like this. “No way. C’mon, let’s just go.”

    You end up detouring one more time for a little scoop of ice cream each (in the middle of winter, really?) and then finally get around to leaving the main square. The street is fairly well lit, but the fog thickens fast in winter and you can hardly see the next streetlamp most of the time. There aren’t nearly as many people around here, either, given that most would be going home from a train station. So it’s just quiet enough to feel eerie, even though the crowd is still audible just behind you.

    “...” You keep thinking about the gory scenes from the play. The guillotine gleaming as it falls down on Erejil. The bloody, ragged wound from his poisoned knife. Broken bodies lying in the street. The actors were <em>good.</em> Too good.

    <em>Scene 83</em>
    The walk back is longer than you remember. It’s dark and cold and (though you won’t admit it to Naoriel) more than a little scary with your current state of Mind. One of the streetlights is even out for some reason, meaning you have to walk quickly through an area of almost total darkness. Footsteps on stone muffled by the mist. Two sets... no; three?! You shiver when you notice that, almost breaking into a run, but manage to stay just calm enough to not freak out entirely.

    ... It’s just a normal guy walking past, moving quicker than you with his long legs. He nods as he passes, hands in his pockets against the chill. Whew.

    You return to the Cathedra without incident, returning souvenirs to rooms (you still don’t know what she’s going to do with that hat) and generally cleaning up after your excursion. Still too early to straight-up go to bed, you then return downstairs to the common area to chat and share and generally hang out with your friends. Etalyn shows up after a while (with Yara) but they both hurry off with a muttered excuse about cleaning up as well.

    At some point Rhysa comes down as well, normally-floofy hair slicked down after a shower, and you start to put the pieces together. It’s still hard for you to talk to her as you’re not really friends, but curiosity helps push you forward regardless. “Hey, Rhysa... erm, did I see you at the festival today...? With, um, Etalyn?”

    “Maybe? By the main stage?”

    “Er, <em>on</em> the main stage.”

    “Ah, heh heh. Yeah, probably. What’d you think of the match?”

    “I... didn’t get there till the end,” you admit. Easier than trying to make something up. “I was just k-kinda surprised that Angels would be out fighting on stage.”

    “Yeah, it’s like ‘how is she getting all these matches in public?’ I think one of the bishops has a thing for her, y’know?”

    “... N-no?”

Even if she’s requesting them, someone’s gotta approve them too. I’m betting one of the bishops really likes having her fight. Maybe it makes him look good because she’s so good at it.”

    “Ah.” This is why you don’t talk to Rhysa much. She’s a little too high-energy for your default state. But you still want your question answered and you’re pretty sure she misinterpreted it. “But, er, what I really meant is, er, wouldn’t it be obvious that you’re Angels when you’re fighting? Why have disguises on?”

    “Gotcha. It’s an image thing. The Cathedra’s all holy, right? So it doesn’t want to just have real, actual Angels visibly beating each other up. That wouldn’t be good for anyone to see, and someone’s bound to complain about ‘misusing God’s powers’ or something, right? But it’s still fun to watch, especially during the festival, so they have us just disguise up, make sure to not use any magic except what can be explained as just ‘someone who’s really athletic,’ and go at it. You’d think someone might notice with all the crazy jumps and stuff, but apparently not. Most people don’t even know we can do disguises, so it doesn’t even occur to them that we might be Angels.”

    “That makes sense... wait, how is disguise magic a secret? The whole Cathedra knows!”

    “Yep, but not many outside of it. Sure, some priests or whatever might blab, but as long as there’s no physical proof (none of us get caught), it’s only a rumor. And they do a lot of image control about how ‘you can recognize an Angel by their divine aspect’ and whatnot, so it’s hard to think just some random person on the street could be one of us.”

    “... Huh. O-okay.”

    The festival was pretty cool overall, you think, though definitely very loud and a little overwhelming. Going with someone was definitely the right call; you’d quickly have gotten burned out on your own. Naoriel said she had fun too, though you’re still a little confused about her reaction to the play. Why had she seen it at such an early age? And, also (you’d almost forgotten by now), <em>natural</em> purple eyes? Angels aren’t born <em>as</em> Angels - she’d have been an ordinary human before her Ascension, just like you, and no humans have purple eyes. That you know of, you suppose, but <em>still.</em> And the changes to your Body after your Ascension just perfect the way you already looked, not alter your features entirely. It’s just weird; you really have no idea how it could have happened.

    You hadn’t meant to interrogate her, really! It just happened!

    ... You’re eventually gonna have to figure out what to do about that almost-kidnapper. Neither of you have seen him since, though if Naoriel’s idea is correct, you don’t even know what he actually looks like. He could be any Angel in the Cathedra, walking right by you every day, and you’d have no idea.

    ... God, you’re terrible about this. Why do you always start thinking about big problems as soon as you get into bed? You <em>know</em> you can’t fall asleep like this! You’ve got to get more disciplined with your Mind training. Starting right now. There’s nothing you can do about it tonight, so you forcefully cut yourself off from thinking about it. At least, you try.

    ... Eventually, you manage to fall asleep.

    What if He isn’t?

    ... You wake up before the sun, bedsheets a tangled mess and the echoes of your nightmares still clear in your Mind. You’ve got a slight cough - impossible, since you can’t get sick - that doesn’t go away until after you’ve washed up and gotten dressed. You spend some more time studying the miracle you still haven’t managed to cast properly. It hurts to try, feeling like a painful stretching on your lungs. You keep at it anyway.

    <em>Scene 84</em>
    The Day of Mind, similarly to the Day of Body, is centered around the aspect from which it takes its name. Whereas yesterday you had athletes, chefs, and playwrights, today you have artists, authors, and... still playwrights. It seems theater is a mix of Mind and Body - although the same could be said of pretty much everything from both days. As you’ve learned, there’s rarely such a thing as a strict categorical division when it comes to aspects (and most things, really). The lines blur. The Day of Soul will likely feature plays for a third time. People like theater.

    Anyway, you’re still bundled up today, but not hiding your face now that Yara’s with you and capable of maintaining proper transmutation disguises. You did tease him a little about not having faith in his no-magic disguise plan, but really you prefer it this way too. It’s way more convenient and also much less nerve-wracking. You similarly teased him a little about being out with Etalyn yesterday, but not much. You get it.

    Now... how are you going to talk with Serri? She seems to be in a good mood today, poking around at the various booths and demonstrations around the square; you can’t just go up and ask if she’s figured out a solution to her... decision? Sort of? From what you’ve heard, she’s committed to learning external Body projection as her first specialization, but whether to heal or harm (or both) is still a mystery. You haven’t really had many chats with her since the day of the duel. But, as you noted yesterday, the festival isn’t really a good place for in-depth or secret conversations. Maybe you should just give up and hang out with her normally. Plus, Yara’s here too and you don’t know how much he knows about all that.

Both because Serri’s good friends with him <em>and</em> because of his general personality. How can you avoid getting sucked into the antics of a guy who goes around comparing the baking abilities of every depiction of the original twelve Angels he can find (and there are a lot of them), based on little differences in their likenesses? You can’t. And so you don’t.

    You make your way across a large portion of the square, crossing between artists’ booths and stopping at whatever seems interesting on the way. There’s plenty beyond just traditional paintings around; it seems a major interpretation of “Mind” is “creative,” so pretty much anything cool and handmade is fair game. Sculptures with seemingly impossible contours or of unusual materials, like chain links. That one captures your attention for a while, just wondering how it can stand up like that with no obvious means of support. It seems like the links themselves are somehow providing their own tension to avoid a collapse, but it’s beyond you to find where exactly the support is located. You can see right through it; there’s no pole or anything!

    Woven rugs or tapestries are also fairly traditional, but ones that can fold out into large structures are definitely not. This is where Yara gets another one of his Angel depictions, noting that “these ones won’t be quite so effective due to excessive flammability.” Being made of yarn does seem like a significant disadvantage in baking, you have to admit.

Yara dings these again for flammability, as well as lacking arms, but you and Serri try to convince him to relax the requirements and go on the description in the text instead of the physical books. He eventually agrees and also accepts one of the cover illustrations for consideration too. You’re pretty sure that one didn’t actually happen in reality, given that it depicts one of the twelve in a sword-lock against a shade, when shades didn’t exist until Erejil’s era hundreds of years later. Also, you don’t think shades have quite such well-defined physiques. Also also, you’re pretty sure most Angels didn’t fight nude with just conveniently positioned limbs and swords to cover anything up. What kind of a book is this, actually? Oh, you’re moving on. Yara notes impractical attire for baking purposes. You note impractical attire for all purposes. Serri doesn’t note anything, since you’ve already covered it.

    Science is not absent today either. The gearworkers have returned to show off new inventions and concepts that aren’t necessarily Body-related, but are still important or interesting. But beyond them, other scientists haven’t been idle either. A lot of this new stuff about medicine or physics or even magic (yes, people outside of the Cathedra study it as well, though they typically end up being recruited before long if they get too in-depth) is well over your head. Plus, the stuff you do understand is mostly magic-related, and it probably would be a little suspicious to know too much about that. No new depictions of the twelve original Angels except in name alone. Yara doesn’t score any of these.

    <em>Scene 85</em>
    A fortune teller? There’s a quaint little booth packed in just beside the stands, but it doesn’t look how you’d expect.

    Divining the future is impossible, and so its practice is forbidden. <em>However</em>, there are plenty of useful and quite possible methods of predicting future events, like weather patterns or elections - or even just games of chance - to the point where an outright ban on anything to do with probability would be impractically cumbersome. So predicting the future based on mathematics or concrete events is allowed, but doing so with false magic or no evidence is not.

    Fortune telling, as you’d expect, originally fell into the latter category when this rule was implemented. But its practitioners (surprisingly industrious!) spent time to devise and prove out a variety of mathematical methods related to drawing cards, marbles, or other objects. Several people did studies and found various levels of correlation between predicted and actual outcomes. Hardly any of the studies agreed, which meant (depending on who you asked) that some of the studies were correct and a correlation existed - thus validating these methods as accurate - or that more studies were needed to confirm - thus allowing fortune tellers to practice normally as long as they called their trade “research.”

    Some in the city legislature have caught on, but some haven’t and most have better things to do. For now, the practice remains legal, but only just. All you need to do is have a little disclaimer on your stand - ah, like over there - and it counts as “research.” Perfect.

    Of course, you don’t know any of these details since you’re not very interested in niche legislative loopholes. Rather, you’re just vaguely aware that fortune telling is more allowed than not and that most oracles tend to look all mystical, covered in silks and ribbons and weird dark candles. Not, you know, like a banker.

Average height, maybe a little pudgy, sandy hair and a tan vest over a collared shirt and dark brown trousers. Like a financial worker might wear.

    “Hey, I’ll meet you up there,” you call to Serri (Yara’s already made his way up). “Gonna check something out first.”

    You can barely hear the “okay!” shouted back. People are very excited for whatever this next play is.

    The line isn’t too bad (again, people are excited for the play) and you can see that the oracle is using cards here. He shuffles the deck and holds them out, then you pick three (Body, Mind, Soul) to reveal your fate. Simple, normal. You’re not familiar with the pictures on the cards, but that’s fine. It’s only his clothes that are weird. Are you reading too much into this just to be scammed?

    Too late. You’re up next.

    The noise of the festival seems to fade away a little as you sit down on the little chair in front of the booth. It’s too short for you. The oracle turns his head slightly. Quizzically? You suppose you’re not a normal customer. “Good day, miss. A reading for you?”

    “Er, yes please.”

    “Very good. Of course, no charge for someone like you.”

    “... Huh? Like, only adults have to pay?”

    “Something like that.” He shuffles the cards, hands bare despite the cold. His left pinky bears a golden ring adorned with a light blue gem. You resist the urge to ask about it. Not a normal ring, nor a normal finger to wear it on. The cards are presented. “Please draw just one to start with. This represents your Body.”

    You hesitate. What should you pick? The middle? A side? Eventually, you decide on one slightly to the left of center.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1222721182814703686 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1222721182814703686><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 27, 2024 9:37 PM">9:37 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Ah, the broken gear.” Indeed, the card shows an image of a stylized clockwork gear with several of the tiny teeth broken off. Shards of metal lie scattered in the picture’s background. “My condolences. Your Body bears a permanent flaw which you will never be able to repair. But, as you drew the gear right-side-up, that flaw should remain the only one. You will otherwise be blessed with good health for the rest of your days.”

    “...” Eerily accurate. Could that apply to a lot of people? You know that’s how a lot of fortune telling sounds good; the advice is so vague it’s correct for the vast majority of people. Maybe?

    “Please pick the second, for your Mind.”

    You veer right for this one, almost but not quite near the end.

    “The sun.” The card bears an image of a burning, fiery orb that you’ve only ever seen through a curtain of mist. Inky purple-blackness fills the background behind it. “You are the heart of an important group; the linchpin that holds it together. That may be a family, a group of friends, a workplace, or something else, but you are a beacon of light that maintains these bonds. Again, you drew it right side up, so your efforts will not be in vain. You will be able to overcome your flaws with the help of those around you.”

    “...?” The Cathedra, obviously not. But your group of friends? Your family? Surely, this card can apply to almost anyone who <em>has</em> a family. Well, if they still get along. But nearly everyone has <em>some</em> group they belong to, right?

    “Please pick the last card, for your Soul.”

    The center. No, no. That one’s sticking out a little, like he wants you to pick it. Instead, you select one midway to the right that’s almost hiding under a different card.

    The oracle lets out a breath as you turn it over. “The fallen Angel...”

    “Betrayal. Someone close to you will turn against you. A friend, a family member, a mentor; someone like that. And, I’m afraid, the upside-down card indicates they will succeed, potentially using the broken gear to their advantage. You will be badly hurt by this, though with the sun as it was drawn, you may still recover if you dare continue to trust those you still hold dear.”

    That... that one can’t possibly apply to a large number of people. Surely not.

    The oracle smiles sadly. “I cannot avert this fate, but I may be able to do just one more thing to help. Choose a question, then pick one more card.”

    <em>Scene 86</em>
    “... Why?”

    A nod. “Choose your card.”

    This time, you’re done messing around with Mind games on which card to pick. Somehow, it seems appropriate to go for the most obvious one; the one directly in the center.

    “The spy.”

    It shows a grim-looking person mostly swallowed by a dark coat, half-illuminated by a dim streetlight. Mechanical, you note in a detached sort of way. These cards can’t be that old, since mechanical lights aren’t that old either. Alarmingly, you’ve drawn this one upside-down as well.

    “Secrets will be the cause. Whether your own, the betrayer’s, or someone else’s, the upside-down draw indicates that a secret will be exposed which should have remained hidden. These fourth-card draws are notoriously vague beyond the basics, so it’s unclear whose secret, who reveals it, or why specifically the reveal will incite a betrayal. But I’m afraid that’s all I can do; a fifth-card draw simply has too many variables to grant even vague hints.”

    The oracle sweeps the cards back into his deck, shuffling it quickly. “The broken gear, the sun, the fallen Angel, and the spy. You certainly are going to be an interesting one to watch. Good luck, and I hope you’ve learned something from my humble little cards.”

    You stand, glancing  behind you to see if anyone else is in line. Apparently not; business seems to be wrapping up for the play. But... “You’re not a normal oracle,” you inform the not-normal oracle, as if he didn’t already know. “So who are you?”

    A slight grin; a shrug. “No one too important, believe you me. Just an observer.”

    “Do you have a name?” Something about him makes you think knowing more would be a very good idea.

    “A name? Hum, if we meet again, you can call me God.”

    Literally taken aback, you step away from the table slightly. “What?! You can’t say that!” Who does this guy think he is, to pretend to be God like that?

    “... Phil?”

    “An ordinary name for an ordinary man. Now, I believe you have somewhere to be.”

    You can hear the opening announcements for the play; Serri and Yara will be wondering what’s taking you so long. “... Fine. Phil.”

    “Good luck!” he says again as you turn away. “And be careful with those secrets.”

    What a strange person.

    Anyway, you don’t have time to think too much about your fortune. The first part did seem fairly accurate, though it’s hard to tell and of course he couldn’t have been <em>actually</em> correct; legitimate magical divination is impossible and there’s no mathematical model that could possibly predict a betrayal like that without any information on you and your situation. And he wasn’t even using magic, since he wasn’t an Angel. You checked by looking at his Soul, right?

    “...”

    Okay, maybe you didn’t, but an Angel in disguise surely wouldn’t have done anything like that. Unless... oh no, you’re thinking about the kidnapper now. Naoriel has a big secret. It could cause a betrayal if it gets out, depending on your definition of a betrayal. But that’s not <em>your</em> fortune, really, it’s Naoriel’s! And, come on, there’s no way anyone would sit around and tell fortunes for people all day just for the <em>chance</em> of messing with you specifically. What would they even gain? Just to make you uncomfortable? Why?! It doesn’t make any sense. It can’t have been the kidnapper.

    “Jess, stop spacing out.”

    Ack! You said you didn’t have time to think too much about it, and so of course the very first thing you did was think too much about it. “Sorry,” you murmur back, trying to pay attention.

A lot of it goes over your head, to be honest, though at least the others seem to be having fun. You didn’t know Serri was into this sort of thing, but it does make sense for Yara.

    Instead, you do your best to pay attention, fail, and end up spacing out again thinking about the fortune teller. You can see why people believe in this sort of thing now; he was really convincing. Just the frank sincerity with which he delivered his lines really made it seem like he believed what he said. Maybe he did. Do you? If you do, are you going to be more paranoid and worse off? Or if you don’t, are you going to accidentally let something slip and cause the fortune to come true after all? And how long is the timeline here? Like, tomorrow? Next year? In a decade? Longer? More details would make it too easy to prove or disprove, you suppose.

    Ugh, what a pain. Why did you have to meet this guy? You’ve got so many other things to worry about, like when you can talk to Serri! It’s already late afternoon and, although you didn’t catch how long this play will run for because you were busy with... “Phil” at the time, it’s probably going to be getting dark by its conclusion. Sure, it was another generally fun day, but did you <em>accomplish</em> anything? Did you <em>need</em> to? Should you just corner her after dinner and say you need to talk? Is that too cliche? Is <em>this</em> a secret? Agh!

    <em>Scene 87</em>
    “The one presiding at a feast, of course. You can’t be anything but a good baker if you’re the one producing the food, yes?”

    “I still think it was the one with the two swords. Imagine how much bread you could cut with starmetal like that! Besides, just because you’re in charge of a feast doesn’t mean you’re the cook as well.”

    “And just because you have two swords doesn’t mean you’re using them to slice bread. Jessamine, would you happen to have an opinion to resolve this deadlock?”

    Yara and Serri have been debating the results of the “which depiction of the original twelve Angels would be the best at baking” contest since leaving the play. It’s dark now and “Phil” is gone. You didn’t really expect him to be there, and you wouldn’t have known what to say anyway, but... you kept an eye out regardless. “I don’t know; the one with the ridiculously massive wings sure could carry a lot of pastries in there...”

    “Oh for - eventually we’re going to have to eliminate some of the candidates, you know.”

    You smile lightly as a fresh debate breaks out about the merits of being able to carry all that stuff. It feels a little weird to be arguing about the original twelve Angels in such a silly way, but you suppose it’s been long enough and you’re Angelic enough to get away with it. Presumably, they would have been happy to know they helped create an environment safe enough where they <em>could</em> be joked about like this. Where the majority of people can just ignore the darkness for most of their lives and be fine.

Eventually, a technical agreement is made to pare down the scope of the question. Carrying baked goods is not baking, nor is slicing baked goods. Were those the categories, different depictions would have claimed victory. But, if you’re considering strictly prowess in preparing and heating - from ingredients to emergence from the oven - the three of you eventually agree on Yara’s answer: the depiction of Angel Azuriel presiding over a feast during the early days of the war. Given the context of the event, it seems likely that she did prepare some of the food herself, which makes it the only image of actual baking you’ve seen today. At least, the implication of baking. Congratulations to Yara.

    Your return to the Cathedra is again uneventful, and this time you don’t even get startled by a fast-walking man in the dark. Instead, you follow much the same routine as yesterday: cleaning up and putting away the souvenirs you got, followed by a return downstairs to chat with most of the rest of the trainees.

    Serri doesn’t seem as cold to you today, but she doesn’t go out of her way to hang out with you and (crucially) also doesn’t mention her decision. It’s been two weeks now since your duel, and a little longer since the conversation that led to it. Surely she should have brought it up again by now if she were intending to. Is she just going to leave it at that for, well, ever?

    Still, you don’t want to rush or force her. If she doesn’t want to talk about it, then that’s her decision to make. Even if that makes you think that maybe you’re somehow not good enough to be confided in.

A beckoning sign. Building pressure in your lungs as you exert yourself more and more, trying to escape.

    A cold, metallic shock as the blade eventually sinks into your back.

    Over.

    And over.

    And over again.

    At some point, you wake up. It’s still dark; you scramble out of bed halfway inside a dream and run into the wall. Fumble for a switch and turn on a lamp. You’re shaking. There’s a pain in your back, right where you’ve just been stabbed dozens of times over. In reality? No, surely not. The dream lingers.

    You lock yourself in the bathroom and use a combination of two mirrors to inspect your back. Nothing but smooth, perfect skin. Rub your hand on the spot that hurts. Nothing but a phantom pain. It fades with the new sensation.

    More minutes pass before you manage to untangle the last threads of the dream and emerge fully into the waking world. You’re still shivering, a little. Peek back into your bedroom with its lonely active lamp, scanning the shadows for a boogeyman. Nothing. You creep out and turn on the rest of the lights, using the extra illumination to clear the rest of your apartment as well. Sit wrapped in blankets and wait for the sunrise.

    ... You’re starting to wonder if there’s something wrong with you.

How can you possibly feel safe unless you somehow figure out who they are and reveal them to someone who can actually do something about it?

    It’s just a lot to deal with.

    The sun finally peeks over the horizon, turning the mist orange as it always does, and you get ready for the Day of Soul. The main festival is again available for ordinary people, but Angels have a different way to celebrate. Today, you will attend a special mass given by one of the bishops instead of a normal priest, then reflect on the year. A lot happened, so you’ll certainly have a lot to reflect on. And once you’re done with that, you’re supposed to offer your feelings about it to God (positive, negative, anything) so He can help you do your best in the year to come.

    As with a lot of these reflection things, there’s not much in the way of guidelines. Some people seclude themselves for the day; others spend the time with their friends or even random strangers for that unbiased outside opinion. As for you...

    <em>Scene 88</em>
    Somehow, you’re a little disappointed in the Day of Soul mass. It’s longer than normal and it’s presented by a bishop instead of a priest, but otherwise it’s much the same as regular mass. You’ve heard most of this before. Be good. Devote yourself to serving God and the people who rely on you. Live as a beacon. As a heart. As a... sun, perhaps.

    Ugh. You’re still thinking about that reading from yesterday, plus you’re glancing around the cathedral and wondering who the traitor could be. Most of the Angels are here now - not those on the walls or missions, but most others - so the odds are good the traitor is here too. Probably not one of the trainees or young Angels, given their powers, but who among the senior Angels could possibly be so twisted? Or maybe even someone above them, an Archangel? You scan the smaller group sitting near the bishop with their brilliant glows and beautiful wings. You don’t recognize most of them; you’ve really only interacted with Aveline before.

    And beside the dozen or so Archangels are the two current Seraphim, the most powerful and most senior Angels in the city. They resemble golden statues, with metallic skin, glowing eyes, and permanently manifested wings shimmering with a reflective texture. It’s almost hard to believe they were once human - and still are, actually. Beneath the almost alien exterior, the Souls inside are still as human as yours. Stronger, of course, but fundamentally the same as everyone else’s.

They work alongside the primes, serving the Emissary directly on only the most critical tasks. Someone like that would be above scrutiny from all but the head of Inquisition or the Emissary himself.

    You stare at the flawless, golden-skinned men for perhaps longer than you should, feeling irrational paranoia against these paragons of divinity. From the outside, trying to kidnap Naoriel would seem insane. But to a Seraph, with a stronger (and stranger) Mind than anyone currently alive...? Anyway, when one of them seems to notice something and glances in your direction, you quickly look away. It’s entirely possible their senses are so keen as to actually notice you.

    ... You’re doing a real bad job of paying attention and reflecting on the year.

    After mass, you try to rectify that. You spend some time with anyone you know that you run into. Sometimes talking, sometimes not. Thinking. Remembering.

    Yara, the first Angel to properly welcome you to the Cathedra, emerging from his blanket pile and offering encouragement during your first weeks and onwards. Showing you magic, helping you learn about this strange new world of divinity and scheming. The experiment; the firing. You still haven’t figured out why your Souls glowed there. You might never.

Are you still friends? Probably. But as close as you once were? Not really, and you don’t know why. You almost ask her straight-out as you sit together and contemplate the year, but can’t quite find the courage. She might not even know either. Still, she clearly cares for you and vice versa. Is that enough?

    Etalyn, blunt and abrasive at worst, but protecting and steadfast at best. You’re pretty sure she and Yara are dating at this point, though no one’s ever <em>actually</em> confirmed it. She’s always available to back you up if you need it, even if you’re not that close.

    Naoriel, the mystery girl whose secrets you’ve managed to uncover, somewhat by accident. At least, some of them. Reclusive to most, but surprisingly forthcoming and friendly when you get to know her. Strong. Able to support herself under the terrible pressure of her lineage, and against that traitor hunting her for it. You doubt she’s been having nightmares like you.

    Denn, jovial and calm no matter the situation. He’s capable of making Erich cool off as well, which you think is a neat super power. Dependable.

    Clarity’s still around too, even though she’s graduated. Still as cheerful and energetic as always, despite her new responsibilities. Always willing to listen, even if you don’t want advice.

    And on and on it goes. You’ve met so many people and made so many friends over the past year-ish. It’s gone so much better than you could have thought. Sure, you’ve had some problems. You feel alienated from your family. You have to deal with the traitor or you’ll never stop having nightmares. You’re still sick, despite your ostensibly perfect Body. But overall, you’re a better you. And that’s all you can really hope for, isn’t it?

Tomorrow (today) is now January 1st again, and in a scant few hours, another group of children will have their Calling ceremonies. One or two might Ascend.

    But to you, by now, that possibility isn’t anything new. This is the tenth Calling day since your own and no new Angels have been chosen. Even though you know there’s a chance, and it would start to get really quite worrying if there remained none, you still sort of don’t believe it’ll happen.

    Until church bells ring across the city, signaling a child has been found worthy. As of today, you are no longer the Cathedra’s newest Angel.

    <em>Scene 89</em>
    Well, you’ve got to meet them, don’t you? To start with, you check with Yara to get some advice, as you’re not sure you want to copy his strategy exactly. Plus, it might have been a coincidence anyway.

    “Oh, yes, I’ve been known to do that every so often. It can be quite entertaining to meet new Angels before Cobb’s gotten to them, as you know so well. Sometimes I get distracted or they change where the tour goes, but I’ve made it most of the time. Are you planning your own greetings tonight?”

    “Well...” You shuffle your shoes on the floor, not entirely sure you want to admit it. But Yara’s not dumb and you were pretty obvious. “Yeah. I’m curious.”

    “Hmm! Well, I feel I can leave this one to you, then. Make sure to give me a report in the morning so I know exactly how insufferable to be for the not-party!”

    “W-wait, I didn’t want to break your tradition or anything-”

    “Ah, Jessamine, always so worried about others. Do you remember that I’m graduating in...” He pauses, counting up the time. “Ten months? I won’t be able to do this any longer; if anything, I’m grateful that someone will be around to carry on my silly little practice.”

    “... That kinda makes it sound like you’re going away when you graduate. You’re still going to be right here; you could keep doing it.” A pause; he doesn’t say anything immediately. “Right? You’re not <em>actually</em> going anywhere?”

    “Oh, no no. But the older I get, the stranger it seems, yes? I have less in common with new trainees now, and that’s only going to get worse. I figure it’s better to pick a sensible cutoff and leave it to the younger generation than to drag it on forever. Plus, I’ll get to meet them in a few days anyway.”

    “... Okay. I guess that makes sense.”

It’s a silly, lighthearted ritual; where did I put that extra-long blanket so you can rise up out of it? You know how to do the light orb, yes? Or... perhaps it’s better if you make your own decisions.”

    “I don’t know; you’re sounding kinda serious.”

    “You’re right! Come along, we must go do something irreverent immediately!”

    ...

    You’re not sure if Yara was terribly helpful, but at least you’ve got his “permission?” Which you didn’t really need, but it sure would have been awkward if both of you showed up without having talked it over first. Plus, the reminder about his impending graduation was kind of sobering as well. You don’t see Clarity around as much anymore, but you weren’t as close with her as with Yara. When he graduates, are you going to still be friends? You have to assume so, but...

    The day passes as it usually does, though you have less to do because you already cleared up your assignments before the festival. Instead, you keep working on that miracle you’re supposed to be practicing for your lungs. It still hurts, but you’re pretty sure you’re figuring it out. There’s a sort of twist, pause, twist you can do with your Soul that dulls the pain; you’re just not sure <em>why.</em> If you can figure out what exactly you’re doing there, you might be able to apply it in more detail. Something to ask later, maybe.

    Then a bit more reading and some further research into techniques of Mind magic and it’s about time for evening mass. After that, you’re supposed to sequester yourself somewhere for a few hours of solitary reflection (even though you just did that yesterday; maybe you can reflect on your reflection?). But of course, there’s nothing that stops you from picking a spot where you’re likely to be interrupted. After all, it was solitary when you got there. Not your fault if any new Angels you want to meet coincidentally show up!

    “...”

    It’s really hard to reflect when you keep checking the doors. Maybe you can think about that and it’ll count? Why are you even doing this, really? You’re terribly awkward and still shy around strangers, and you’re planning on being the first Angelic trainee this new person will meet? Are you really worthy of making that first impression?

    “...”

    How long are you prepared to wait here if they don’t show up? No, surely they’ve got to come through here at <em>some</em> point to get to their room! Unless... unless they use a different entrance for some reason? But why would - ah <em>ha!</em>

    This new Angel is more observant than you were initially, though it helps that you aren’t hiding like Yara was. Physically, he’s a boy with curly black hair, kinda roundish features, and light brown eyes that almost seem orangeish from your angle. Or maybe that’s the white light spilling from his Body - you had almost forgotten how long it took to get that under control.

    Ack; he’s just looking at you! Nervously? <em>You’re</em> nervous! What did Yara say?

    “Uh, y-you’re new around here, aren’t you?” <em>Calm down, Jess. You’re the cool, intimidating Angel. Don’t be scared of him.</em>

    “Er, yes.” He doesn’t seem to know how to greet you properly - you’re too far away and also sitting down for it to be natural - so he sort of half-bows and creeps a little bit closer. “I’m, er, Jun.”

    Oh God it’s just as awkward as you feared. You can’t decide whether to stand up, stay sitting, walk over to him (is he still coming closer?), or just do a flip into thin air. Closing your book, you end up deciding to stand since that’s what Yara did. Jun is slightly shorter than you, which is kind of a novel experience when all your friends are older than you.

    “Father Turner?” You’re surprised enough to forget to be nervous. “Was he your priest too?”

    A nod. “He was really shocked to help Ascend two Angels in a row, heh.”

    “I would be too,” you mumble. “Does that mean you were in my school and I just never met you?”

    “No; I was too far south. B-but I probably saw you at mass a few times and just never knew.”

    “Well, I wasn’t very notable until last year,” you admit, confidence partially restored due to the unexpected discovery of some common ground. Seriously, what are the odds for the same priest to get two Angels in a row, out of the whole city?

    “S-so, were you... waiting for me?”

    <em>Scene 90</em>
    “Well...” Like with Yara, you kind of doubt you can get away with denying it. Seriously; there’s <em>no one else</em> around and you could easily have been in your room if you actually wanted to read. “Yeah, but I didn’t know it would be you specifically. One of my friends sort of has a tradition to meet new Angels early and it was my turn tonight. I’m just curious what sort of person just Ascended.” A pause. “And Brother Cobb’s introduction doesn’t really help at all, in my experience.”

    “Brother Cobb...?”

    “You’ll... meet him tomorrow. One of your instructors. But - oh - I should probably tell you that it’s also sort of a tradition for all the trainee Angels to gather in the evening the day after an Ascension to properly meet the new Angel. It’ll usually be right here just after evening bell, if you want to meet everyone else.”

    “Okay. I’ll, er, I can go.”

    “Well... good!” A pause. You’re really bad at this whole “conversation” thing. What did you even talk about with Yara? Should you just abort and leave? Are you bothering Jun; does he just want to go to bed? It’s pretty late and a lot must have happened...

    “...”

    “I’m, er, probably keeping you from heading to your room. I should probably go...” Aaand you lost your nerve. The situation has reached a critical mass of awkwardness.

    “O-oh. Okay; see you tomorrow.”

    Neutral? Still nervous? Just buried in the awkwardness too? You can’t tell; you’re too flustered. You pick up your book and hurry back upstairs, rushing to make it quickly because you remember Jun will probably be taking this stairway too and you really don’t want to run into him again on the stairs! Argh; that didn’t really go well at all, and you hardly learned anything that won’t be immediately obvious tomorrow! Maybe that Father Turner was involved, but nothing more. Yara won’t get a useful report at all.

    Uneasy dreams again. Lost, confused. At least nothing murders you tonight.

    “Don’t like them, huh? Alright, I’ll turn up the insufferability a few notches.”

    “No, no; not like that. His name is Jun and I don’t think he’s bad or anything. I just, uh, I’m not good at <em>talking</em> to people.”

    Yara nods sagely. “And yet you continue to practice even now. Truly an inspiring tale of perseverance against any odds.”

    “I guess. I feel like I just made a fool of myself, though.”

    “And you think I didn’t? Jessamine, I’m so proud. That’s one of the <em>points</em> of this little tradition. Angels aren’t perfect, and in fact they can be as terribly awkward as any ordinary person! Don’t you think that makes new trainees feel just a little better about their own prowess?”

    “... Maybe? I guess it depends on the person.”

    “Hmm. As do most things. Regardless, did you get anything interesting out of your conversation?”

    “Uh, his priest was the same as mine. That’s pretty unusual for the same one to get two Angels in a row.”

    “Mm hmm! It certainly is! Did you happen to know this Jun before your respective Ascensions?”

    “No; it’s a pretty big neighborhood. We might have seen each other at mass, but I never really noticed.”

    “Mm. Only but so much of a coincidence, then. Now, if your <em>classmate</em>, for instance, had Ascended as well, <em>that</em> would certainly be worthy of a conspiracy theory.”

    “You’d get people transferring in to try and get their kids to Ascend.”

    “I imagine there will be some of that even with this scenario. It has been quite a long time between Ascensions, so perhaps more people are aware of the identities of the last two Angels. You two might end up as celebrities!”

    “Oh, please no. It’s already hard enough with everyone looking at me just for being an Angel; I don’t need more fame on top of that.”

    “All the more reason to learn that disguise magic! Only a few months to go!”

You don’t really get any more details here given how brief it is, and then you’re off to your normal courses again. It’s been a while with the festival days and such. But there’s a different feeling now that it’s a new year. You’re getting close to the end of many of these courses; about two months for the ones that started just after your Ascension. It’ll go by quickly, since you’re finally grasping the fundamentals and moving on to application.

    Brother Trigg is the first monk to officially say it. “Angel Jessamine, a moment please!” he calls after dismissing the rest of the class.

    You look up and head over, shoving your stuff into your bag untidily. “Yes?”

    “It’s been almost a year now, hasn’t it? Time certainly flies when you’re moving through years every week. And now we’re very nearly caught up to the present day.”

    Trigg’s course started before year 0 and moved through history towards the current year, 1225. At this point, you’ve made it into the 13th century and are on track to catch up to “now” before the end of the month. “Yeah, I’m excited to see what you do with the last month at this pace.”

    “Precisely; precisely. I traditionally give Angelic students a research project for their final month with me, exploring a topic from history that interests them and still holds open questions to this very day. Typically, it ends up being something about magic or the corruption - you young Angels can’t stop thinking about it! - but there have been a few exceptions. I just wanted to introduce the idea now and see if you have any initial topics in Mind.”

    <em>Scene 91</em>
    Somewhat surprisingly, you do actually have an answer in Mind. “I’ve been thinking about Erejil recently,” you admit. “Ever since I saw the play during the festival. And... some things don’t really make sense.”

    “Mm?”

    “He was an actual Angel, right? Despite the ‘false’ title, he Ascended and should have been resistant to the corruption. But all the depictions I’ve seen show him already Mentally corrupted at his first meeting with the shade, since otherwise he surely wouldn’t accept that deal. And it can’t have been a normal sickness of the Mind because Angels are immune to those too. So... it just seems like he fell a lot faster than I would expect.”

    Brother Trigg smiles. “Ah, I’m glad you noticed those inconsistencies. Erejil’s resistance has a fairly quick answer, however, so you may wish to extend your topic. Perhaps a more general approach?”

    You’re not sure if you should feel proud for noticing it or embarrassed that it’s apparently not that hard to answer, so you just average out to neutral and carry on. “Erm, I’m kind of curious about corruption resistance generally. Erejil is a famous example, but everyone has different levels of resistance even now. So what affects that?”

    “Now you’re getting towards a proper topic. Corruption resistance among Angels is somewhat well-studied, but more from a perspective of testing and safe doses. And of course, resistance in normal people is often considered too dangerous to experiment with beyond the theoreticals. There have been some investigations into other traits that correlate with resistance, but there are indeed still open questions.” He nods. “Consider your topic further over the next week or so, then we’ll get started once you’re certain this is what you want to do.”

    “Okay.”

You only started in June, but it’s not as long as most other courses and will be concluding just next week. Specifically...

    “At this point, all three of you should be familiar with directing your Soul in a variety of ways, and should be on the path to competency with your first chosen area of specialization. The fundamentals are complete; you are ready to advance into application.”

    You glance at each other, but none of you speak. You’re all aware of his tendency to pause by now.

    Indeed, he continues after a few moments. “You will be tested on your fundamental skills over the remainder of this week, after which you will be granted approval to take any of the advanced magic courses you so desire. I recommend ones linked to your focus area to start with, but it is up to your discretion.”

    Another series of glances. You hadn’t heard about these tests. Serri looks worried; Erich seems unconcerned. Figures; he’s consistently the best of the three of you. And, well, despite her assertions and surprising prowess in that duel, Serri remains not quite as... good. You feel a little guilty even thinking it, but you couldn’t think of a nicer way to phrase it between Cobb’s sentences.

    “Each day’s tests will only be announced at the beginning of our time for that day, so there’s no need to study. Everything will be application-based, and everything should be intuitive to you... assuming you’ve been paying attention.” He half-smiles, just for a moment. “Which I’m certain you all have.”

Despite his words, you’re just getting more nervous. Now you’re going to be thinking about the next day’s tests for the rest of the week. Thanks, Cobb. Plus, what happens if you fail? Why didn’t Yara say anything about this? Or... is it new this year, just because he thinks someone in the course might not be good enough? Agh, stop thinking about her like that! This might be why she’s been distant lately! Worry about your own performance!

    “So, we will begin right now. Please stand.”

    There’s a moment of confusion, followed by a clattering of chairs. <em>Now?!</em>

    “Release your glows, please.”

    There’s another person in the room you hadn’t noticed; or maybe she’s just come in. A younger monk in the lighter grey robes that indicate non-senior positions. A scribe, probably, but you could have guessed that from the clipboard. Anyway, the room quickly grows brighter with the light of your collective Souls.

    “And now, seal them.”

    Erich is very fast; his light vanishes in just over a second. You manage it in three or four, followed by Serri with over five. The scribe’s pencil scratches.

    “Good. Now, shift your phase to Soul and...”

    ...

    It’s a long, tiring process. Brother Cobb has you focus mostly on detection today, having you shift your phase to every aspect and identify various items or people. You’re okay at Body, better at Mind, and very good at Soul thanks to your sensitivity - enough to beat Erich more than once. But Serri...

    She’s okay. Never <em>far</em> behind you (except in Soul, where she really struggles), but she never wins any test. You don’t know what the criteria to pass are, but if it’s a competition... she’s not going to do well.

Maybe it’s Erich’s smugness, your occasional glances (you’re really trying not to!), or just having to demonstrate her skills to everyone, but she’s not having a good time. And when it’s finally over and Cobb dismisses you to review the results with his assistant, she hurries off quickly before you can say anything. A distressingly common occurrence lately.

    ... You’ve got to kick that negative attitude. It’s probably not a competition and it’s not like she was forgetting how to do anything or generally being <em>bad</em> in any major way. It’ll be fine. You’ll see at the end of the week.

    It’s gonna be a long week.

    Anyway, there’s the meet-up today for Jun. You’ll probably want to get refreshed and ready for that, since you’re a little burnt out after all that magic. Or... no, you should probably go even if you’re tired. But...

    <em>Scene 92</em>
    But nothing. It wasn’t that bad; you’re just making excuses because you still find socializing difficult. But you know yourself better than to believe yourself... you think. Is that the right way to phrase it? Anyway, better get ready.

    ...

    “So do they do this with all the new Angels, or is this sort of a recent thing?” you ask, tilting your head over at Jun, Sims, and Zeke. Just like during your gathering, the two older Angels have roped Jun into a conversation - though at least Naoriel isn’t involved this time, as she’s over with your group now. She tends to do that whenever Zeke or Sims are involved.

    “Most of them, I would say. I can’t think of any recently who have avoided the treatment, though some were a little grumpier than others about it!”

    Etalyn rolls her eyes.

    “But I’m sure he’ll extricate himself before too long. I mean, it is only fair for them to get to know our newest Angel as well. I know our little group has become fairly tight-knit, but it’s not like we have a monopoly on interpersonal relations!”

    Some scattered blinking. You’re not sure what he’s getting at.

    “In other news!” he exclaims, heavy-handedly changing the topic. “I hear Cobb has started the basic magic exams. Confident, you two?”

    You and Serri look at each other. Erich is across the room with Denn and Emmett. “You know me, Yara; I’m never confident.”

    “That’s the spirit! Or rather, the opposite of the spirit. Come now; you’ll do fine. Nothing in those exams is anything you haven’t practiced a dozen times by now.”

    You half-shrug. “That’s true, but it’s still being put on the spot. He’s got a scribe in there recording all the results; it’s just a lot of pressure.” Serri nods; you continue. “Plus, you could have <em>warned</em> us about it, you know.”

I truly didn’t consider it worth mentioning.”

    Another few glances. You decide to forgive him.

    After a while of talking with other Angels, Jun makes his way around the room to end up with your group. There’s the normal set of re-introductions since of course Cobb’s thing in the morning didn’t stick. Then,

    “Soo, what’d you think of ol’ spooky grandpa?” Yara asks, echoing one of his first questions to you.

    “Spooky grandpa?”

    “The Emissary, of course!”

    “Ah! Er, yes, a little spooky. I don’t know; it was only a few moments.”

    “Hum, I suppose so. Wonder if they’ll ever change that ritual. Anything stand out to you about the Cathedra?”

    “Hmmm... All the plants? You don’t see them all over in the city.” A pause. “But, er, you all probably know that. It was just really interesting to see so many varieties you don’t normally because they’re not as efficient food crops as the standard few. Here, you can have things just because they look nice (although they still make food, of course).”

    “You some kind of gardener before you Ascend?” Etalyn asks, perched sideways on a recliner just to be cool.

    “Kind of, yeah. I wasn’t raised on the farms or anything, but I tended my family’s little balcony garden. Not enough to live on, but enough to add some color to the house and some flavor to the meals.” Another pause; he glances around a bit. “I just think plants are so <em>interesting.</em> They’re clearly living creatures, but they don’t have Minds like other lesser animals. And they’re above other objects, since they can grow and reproduce. So a creature without a Mind, but an object that doesn’t just sit there. Isn’t that just weird, when you think about it?”

    You think about it. It is kinda weird. “I-”

    “... Why?”

    “They’re not dead. They’re full of the weirdest plants I’ve ever seen, but they’re also really pretty, in a corrupted, alien sort of way.”

    A hesitation. “The wastelands aren’t... dead?”

    Ah, you just had that revelation last June. Looks like Jun (whose name, annoyingly, doesn’t rhyme with the month at all, despite its spelling) will have it spoiled a bit ahead of time. “They’re not. Corruption usually doesn’t kill the things it corrupts - even people, sometimes - so the wastelands are just miles and miles of weird grass, trees, and... well, the darkness creatures too, but that’s a given, right?”

    You’re a little concerned that she’s leaving something out. “The, er, plants are still evil, though. Since, um, the corruption...”

    “Yeah, obviously. But that doesn’t mean they’re not really cool.”

    “... Right...”

    Jun decides to speak up now that you’ve sort of backed down. “What... is it like there?”

    “Well...”

    As Serri describes the corrupted plants you saw last June, you hunker down and try to deal with the low, background worry that’s starting to trickle into your Mind. You’ve been thinking about Erejil since you talked to Brother Trigg this morning, and something about Serri’s enthusiasm for the corrupted plants seems vaguely out of place. She does like pretty things, though, and the plants <em>were</em> pretty. Maybe this is just her way of trying to connect with Jun? He does seem to be interested.

You close your physical eyes and, after a few seconds shifting your resonance phase, open your Soul eyes. Serri’s Soul is still nice and bright, just like it’s always been. No trace of corruption that you can see, and none in any of your friends either. Your own Soul still seems a little strange in ways that are hard to describe, but that’s nothing new since the Emissary pointed it out after your collapse. The, er, second one. God, it’s embarrassing that you have to clarify. Still, no corruption. Just the sickness.

    Of course, you aren’t an expert in Soul-sensing, but you are hypersensitive. It’s not like you can spot flaws with the Emissary’s precision, but you’re certainly better than the average trainee. It makes you feel a little better, but not much. Especially...

    Huh?

    Naoriel... what...?

    You turn your head a little, trying to understand what you’re sensing. Her Soul glows the same as everyone else’s. It doesn’t seem damaged, corrupted, or otherwise different from how you’d expect. You can’t explain why you’re confused or what you’re seeing. But something just doesn’t seem quite right.

    Well, great. Now you’re worried <em>and</em> confused. <em>And</em> you missed whatever they were saying about plants, because now the topic has moved on to magic generally. And Yara’s got the cards out; today is just a strange mirror of your own first day.

    You join the game, still uneasy. Cards. <em>The fallen Angel. The Spy.</em> Argh; you have <em>got</em> to stop thinking about Phil’s reading! It’s just going to make you more paranoid!

    <em>Scene 93</em>
    You spend the rest of the week stalking your friends and learning about the Cathedra’s ultimate betrayer.

    The “learning” part at least makes sense. You’re investigating what Brother Trigg told you about Erejil’s resistance before delving into the topic for real. After a day or two, you figured out that the reason is probably in the restricted section; there are plenty of texts that discuss Erejil overall, but stop curiously short (sometimes in the middle of a sentence!) of describing exactly what the deal is, so to speak.

    So you told Brother Trigg. He seemed pleased with your initiative and said he would put in an exception for you, to be activated later in the week. You had no idea it was that easy.

    Then of course there are the tests as well. After the first day of detection, Cobb had you demonstrate basic channeling on the second day, followed by projection in various aspects for the remaining three. He wasn’t wrong when he said you didn’t need to study; you’re doing fine just from regularly practicing over the last few months. It’s a real relief to know that <em>something</em> about your Mental transformation is working, as you’re much more capable than you feel you should be in memorizing these complicated patterns and non-physical motions.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1228507667119738963 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1228507667119738963><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 12, 2024 8:50 PM">8:50 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>And then there’s the stalking. After a few more short conversations with Serri failed to convince you of anything in particular, you decided to straight-up ask her what she - no, just kidding. You decided to “coincidentally” linger nearby and “coincidentally” practice some of the Mental magic you’ve been learning that helps enhance your senses. It turns out that it’s not all Body, actually, and you can cast spells to help filter, detect, and even enhance nearby sounds using your Mind alone. From what your instructor says, combining this technique with Body magic is even more effective (to physically improve your ears, for instance) but at least one of them would need to be transmutation or the other would interfere. So, just the Mind for now.

    She’s quickly making friends with Jun, the two of them chatting about the various plants or fungi in the mines or city respectively and using that as common grounds to talk about all sorts of things. You’re not jealous, really; you’re just... worried. Still, as Yara said, it’s not like you have a monopoly on interpersonal relations...? Why did he say that; you don’t even know what it’s supposed to mean!

    Whatever. You’re unable to find any real evidence of danger in their conversations and feel like more of a creep the longer you listen, so you give up after a day and a half. Should you be worried about Serri, really? You have no idea. At least she’s got her new best pal Jun to rely on.

    And then on to Naoriel. She’s harder to stalk, given that she’s had to deal with probable Inquisitors watching her for a while now, so you’re caught pretty quickly and have to explain what you were doing. You fumble your way through a poor explanation of what you thought might have been going on with her Soul, but are emphatically assured that there’s absolutely nothing wrong with her and you shouldn’t be concerned.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1228507728104919160 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1228507728104919160><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 12, 2024 8:51 PM">8:51 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>So naturally, you figured there was something wrong with her and you should be concerned. But, as with a few other subjects she’s unwilling to talk about, you get nowhere asking or stalking and have to give up this chase too. At least her Soul looks... normal now? Maybe? You still catch yourself staring every so often, still puzzled over what it is you’re sensing. It’s something really subtle, whatever it is, or you’d be able to describe it in more detail. Or you could just be deluding yourself and there’s nothing out of the ordinary to see. That’s what Naoriel thinks.

    Two things happen Friday afternoon. First, Brother Cobb declares that all three of you have passed the basic magic course and are permitted to advance to the higher courses. That’s pretty much it; he doesn’t give a speech or hand you a badge or certificate or anything. It just goes in your paperwork somewhere and that’s the last day of that course. Underwhelming and sorta bureaucratic; that’s Cobb’s style, you suppose. At least you get to be relieved about Serri.

    The second thing is that your exception is processed. Brother Trigg lets you know and, when you next enter the library, you’re allowed to request a catalog and individual works restricted under the categories of Erejil and corruption resistance. It’s a surprisingly vast trove you suddenly have access to, and you kind of wonder just how many books are actually locked away like this, only available for certain people. You still don’t get to go into the basement, though, so you still don’t get to find out.

    And it doesn’t take you long at all to learn that Trigg was right. The reason for Ereijl’s low resistance is, in fact, very simple. It just also raises a whole lot of new questions that you hadn’t anticipated needing to cover in your report.

    False Angel Erejil wasn’t actually a full Angel.

    He was a <em>half</em> Angel.

    What?!

A LOT. But...</em>

    Angels can’t have children. Or, they can, but...? Hang on, you don’t actually know. You’re not really familiar with human <em>or</em> Angelic reproduction beyond the vague basics and a very strong notion that the topic is extremely improper for a young lady like yourself to be thinking about in any depth. But... one thing you do know is that Angels and humans can’t have children together.

    But, well, that’s clearly wrong. According to this text, Erejil’s father was an Angel and his mother was a human worker in the Cathedra. They met, they fell in love, they had a child.

    That child nearly destroyed Nucarreo.

    ... You’re going to need to get some more information on this. You haven’t gone through all the texts you’re allowed access to with this exception, but the titles indicate that they’re primarily about Erejil himself, not his heritage or the mechanics of half-Angels generally. Maybe there’s more stuff in your other exception about resistance, but... is this really the kind of thing you should be reading about?

    Firmly shake your head. This is for <em>research.</em> There’s nothing improper about science or history. Come on; get to it.

    Oh hey, is that Yara? Oh no, has he spotted you?

    <em>Scene 94</em>
    You half-panic for a moment, considering hiding all the books, but he’s already seen you and it would be far too obvious to start covering things up now. You’ll just have to hope he doesn’t-

    “A lovely afternoon, Jessamine. What might you be reading?”

    -ask. “Er...”

    He pulls up a chair and sits down next to you, but is at least polite enough not to lean over and read your books himself. “Researching your next magic courses? I have <em>opinions!”</em>

    “Um, not right now, no...” Maybe... maybe he can help, actually. Are you allowed to share these books with people not on the exception list? Well... it’s Yara; it’ll be fine. “I’m reading about my topic for Brother Trigg’s research project.”

    “Ah, that’s happening already, is it? I suppose it would be, given your course timing. Well, what’s it about? Can I help?”

    “I’m researching corruption resistance, and I’m specifically using Erejil as a starting point. Since, well...” You look for a reaction; maybe he already knows?

    “Hmm. Erejil? He fell to the corruption, of course, and is certainly a very famous figure so there would be plenty of information. That seems smart. I’m afraid I don’t have deep knowledge in that particular area, though I do in the adjacent area of Soul manipulation and templates.”

    “W-well, Erejil kind of fell a little faster than I’d expect, so I asked Trigg, and... long story short, there’s a really big reason why he had low corruption resistance.” You sort of struggle to say the next part, still not entirely sure if you’re allowed to tell him.

    “And what is it?”

    <em>Darn; he really doesn’t know!</em> “Er-” <em>Maybe if I...</em> “Y-Yara, do you, um, know if Angels can have... kids?”

    He leans back, confused. “Does that have anything to do with Erejil?”

    “...”

    “Hum! Alright. Well, they teach you about this sort of thing in your... third year, I believe, but I suppose it won’t do any harm to learn about it early. Are you familiar with human reproduction generally?”

    “Goodness, look at that blush! Ah, to be so young and pure again. Well, you don’t need to tell me all the gory details as long as you get the general process. Anyway, to be brief, no; Angels can’t reproduce. Apparently it’s something about the new Body being unable to handle the Angelic Soul it would inherit, so conception just doesn’t work. Or if it does, the Body gets all corrupted and it’s bad news for everyone. And it’s a similar story if only one parent is an Angel: the Body can’t handle the Soul and either is never conceived at all or turns out horribly wrong when born. And then there’s all that stuff about remaining ‘pure’ like the ministers, so - it’s just this whole deal. So, yes. No Angelic children from birth; only Ascensions at the normal time. Yes?”

    Your face still feels warm, and it’s worse now that you’re thinking about what Yara said too. “W-well, what about...?” You put your finger on a specific passage in the book and lean away, letting Yara peer at it.

    “Hum! Why, it seems the Cathedra might have been keeping secrets from us! Jessamine, this <em>never</em> happens!”

    You look at him. He smirks.

    “Really, though, that is a surprise. Their explanation does make sense from my research: an Angelic Soul <em>would</em> be a lot (too much?) for a Body to handle without years of growth. Even newly Ascended Angels can’t fit their whole Soul in their Body; now imagine trying to do that from the day you were born, or earlier!” He reads the passage again. “A half-Angel, really? Maybe the Soul is more human-like, so it fits properly? But then, how would... Jessamine, you said Erejil had particularly low corruption resistance. Is that because of his heritage? Is that the case for all half-Angels? Are there even any other known half-Angels?”

    “Er, I don’t... know... yet. You kinda just happened to show up like a few minutes after I read that. I’m still pretty surprised too.”

I was just thinking that it would make sense for half-Angels to be more susceptible to the corruption given their ill-fitting Souls (presumably; I of course only learned of their existence a minute ago), but with a sample size of one, there’s not many conclusions to draw quite yet.”

    “I doubt they’re very common at all. Especially if they’re so secret; you’d have to keep your whole relationship and... and your whole <em>child</em> a secret. And since Erejil had, like magic and stuff, I mean, you can’t keep that hidden!”

    “Right,” Yara murmurs, mulling it over. “If a half-Angel seems more like an Angel than a human, the Cathedra would pretty quickly figure out that they weren’t Ascended like a normal kid.” A pause. “But didn’t Erejil go through a normal Ascension?”

    You hesitate too. “Y-yes. At least, that’s what the stories say.”

    “Well, this half-Angel business is also ‘what the stories say,’ so we’re already assuming. So perhaps the Angel-specific characteristics don’t materialize until the normal time, and that’s how he entered the Cathedra as a normal Angel?”

    “And that might be what they mean by ‘Emissaries now watch for his specific traits’ or something like that; they’re making sure no more half-Angels can Ascend and ruin everything like Erejil did!”

    “Mm hmm! Mystery solved, hey? Except for all the details, but I’m sure you’ll be working on that for your project. I’ll certainly be interested to see the end result.”

    “Yeah... Me too.” A pause; you nervously remember something. “Oh, and, uh, you can’t tell anyone about this. Since... I don’t think I’m supposed to have told you. All these books are restricted.”

Very well, you rulebreaking scoundrel. Not a word.” He shuffles the chair back and stands up again, stretching even though he was only sitting for a few minutes. “Well, since you need to do some more reading and I did come in here for a reason of my own (shocking, I know), I suppose I’ll leave you be, then. See you later.”

    You return the farewell and off he goes to check out some material of his own. It really feels like you’ve stumbled onto something important here; you’re finally getting to learn some deeper, less public information. But... if Erejil was the only half-Angel and the Emissaries since then have prevented any more from Ascending like you think, then it doesn’t really matter all that much?

    But that’s just a guess. You’ve still got work to do. So it’s back to the books for a while at least. Then, well, dinner, you suppose. Life goes on.

    [Your next magic course will focus on...? As a reminder, your current focus area is Internal Mind Projection. You can continue to specialize in it, or broaden your focus.]

    <em>Scene 95</em>
    You’ve got some free time over the weekend, given that the basic magic course is over and you only get to even register for your next one next week (probably a continuation of your current focus area, you think; you don’t want to split your attention too much). So, because it seems you’re a hopeless academic, you decide to spend the time continuing on your research for the project that Trigg hasn’t even properly assigned yet. Well, it’ll be good to get the jump on it when he actually does.

    You learn some more stuff, to put it succinctly.

    Erejil was the first known half-Angel. You’re pretty sure of that after delving through much of the catalog you’re allowed from the exceptions you’ve been granted. But there <em>have</em> been others after him. Of course, none have been publicized because of the potential damage to the Cathedra’s reputation: a true, holy Angel falling from grace by conceiving a child with an ordinary human?! That sort of thing. But they’ve been recorded somewhere and, even though you don’t have any of the primary sources, there are some passing references in your various Erejil books. You wonder if Brother Trigg might be willing to grant you another exception about half-Angels specifically; that sure would make this a lot easier.

    Anyway, you’re able to figure out a good amount by putting together various footnotes and asides in a large number of texts. To start with, it seems that Yara is right that half-Angels, though somewhat more perfect in the three aspects than their peers, can typically pass for regular humans until their Calling. At that point, they all Ascend. At least, all the ones you know about, which isn’t many. Maybe a few per century or so, but that still adds up to more than twenty between Erejil’s time and now.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1229969433158483990 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1229969433158483990><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 16, 2024 9:39 PM">9:39 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>You’re missing details on what happened after that for over half of them, but you have managed to track down solid information on seven half-Angels spanning the centuries; the latest was “only” six decades ago in the year 1163. That’s within the lifespan of some of the older monks, and certainly many still-living Angels. You might be able to get a firsthand account of something, if you can find the right person.

    However, you’re not too pleased with the information you find, couched in bland, emotionless sentences or rows in a table. Every one of these known half-Angels, all half-divine children 12 to 18 years of age, were executed.

    You had to do a double take the first time you saw that in a footnote at the end of a chapter. It’s rare the Cathedra will admit to executing anyone except the highest traitors to the church, the city, or the scriptures. For instance, despite Naoriel’s understandable caution about her own heritage, the last time a minister was executed for having a child was almost a century ago; most modern cases are simply expelled from their positions. And executions of Angels are even rarer, with the last one (you finally looked it up) being exactly at the turn of the millennium, year 1000. That’s so long ago you can hardly imagine what life would have been like! Almost all executions nowadays are of heinous (but ordinary) criminals, not those associated with the Cathedra.

    But apparently, half-Angels are so bad that the Cathedra is willing to kill newly-Ascended Angels, even as recently as 60-odd years ago.

    This bothers you, a lot. These kids didn’t choose their parents; that could have been <em>you</em> if you weren’t lucky enough to be born to your mom and dad.

Just... really badly. But was he maybe telling the truth? Had he been checking to see if you were truly a full Angel and not a half? If you had been, would you have died then and there?

    “...”

    You suppose preventing another Erejil is important. Very much so. And if this is what’s needed to do that...

    <em>Is</em> it?

    ...

    Later, you lie awake in bed for what seems like the hundredth time since your Ascension. Thinking, as usual.

    You’re trying to think about Souls. If an Angel and a human can have a half-Angel child, then what does that mean? Is the strength of your Soul determined by your parents? What is Ascension, then? If all half-Angels Ascend, then doesn’t that mean they’re blessed by God? Why would the Cathedra defy Him by killing them?

    That sort of thing. Productive, healthy worries. Well, productive worries. Well, worries.

    But instead you’re just thinking about the executions. Nothing about the logistics or the reasoning or anything academic. Just the clattering of metal as the blade is lifted, the horrible pause of anticipation, and then the wet thunk as it falls. Over and over and over again. You don’t even know if you’re awake at this point; it’s not like you can open your eyes and see the room. It’s all just dark.

    Why? Why are these people so dangerous to warrant such measures? Sure, Erejil fell to the corruption, but you could just keep them safe! Check up on them! Make sure they’re healthy and don’t send them outside the walls! Just be nice! It would be so easy!

    <em>Thunk.</em>

    You jolt, thoughts falling from your Mind like scattered papers in a breeze. That wasn’t just in your head... was it?

    Pause, still your breathing. Ignore your beating heart. Listen.

    Clattering metal. A horrible pause.

    <em>Thunk.</em>

    <em>Thunk.</em> Louder. More well-defined. <em>Closer.</em> You can hear a squelching drip as liquid oozes onto the carpet.

    <em>THUNK.</em>

    Silence. You hold your breath.

    <em>Scene 96</em>
    Clattering metal. It’s so close you can almost feel the blade scraping against your Body. Loud, immediate. Horrible. You can’t help it; you <em>have</em> to know.

    You look.

    A shadow stands beside your bed. It’s tall, humanoid, fuzzy around the edges, and made of utterly pitch-black darkness. Two burning-silver eyes are the only features on its entire Body, and they’re looking at you with an unreadable expression. A guillotine blade hovers abstractly behind it, dripping dark liquid onto the carpet. The creature’s arms have stopped inches from the covers, reaching out for you.

    You can’t move. You don’t know if you’re frozen from fear, some sort of dream-based sleep paralysis, or the shadow’s awful magic.

    The creature steps back, folding its arms in a shockingly human gesture. It considers you. Silently. The only sounds are your shaky, shallow breathing and the guillotine’s macabre dripping. Why haven’t you woken up yet?! <em>Whatever</em> this is, you <em>know</em> it can’t possibly be real. Under any circumstances.

    Because that thing is a shade.

    At least, it looks like how they’ve been described. Human, but made of shadow. Are you hallucinating your stresses into one of your greatest (though most abstract) fears? There’s no way a shade could possibly actually be in your bedroom right now. How would it have gotten into the city? Into the Cathedra? <em>Why would it be carrying a floating guillotine around?!</em>

    ... It’s still just looking at you. The air is freezing cold; you’re shivering even though you still can’t move. You’re transfixed just staring back at it. Training; remember your training! Cleanse outside influences! Wrestle back control of yourself! C’mon... you just have to-
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1230696064085135381 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1230696064085135381><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 18, 2024 9:46 PM">9:46 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The phase of your Soul shifts in order to accommodate the Mind magic you’re about to cast. And at that moment, the shade leaps forwards. You scream, throwing yourself back off the bed and breaking whatever force kept you anchored to the spot with some panic-fueled surge of strength. But then...

    That’s it.

    Everything’s quiet again. You’re disoriented and a little sore from falling off the bed; you’re tangled in the blankets and wiggle around to get free. There’s nothing else in your room and, when you turn on the lights, there’s no evidence a shade had ever been here. No droplets from the guillotine, no footsteps, no icy chill; nothing.

    <em>Maybe I just had another nightmare and fell off the bed?</em> you rationalize. It’s happened before, though not quite as <em>real</em> as this one had felt.

    To be safe, you check the rest of your apartment, just like the last few times you dreamt of terrible monsters hunting you down. Nothing there, as usual. Darkness outside; it’s still the middle of the night. But...

    Did you leave your bedroom door open?

    You usually did, until Naoriel was attacked and your dreams got worse. Then, out of some misplaced sense that the door might actually help, you started closing it at night. Now, it’s open. You could have just forgotten or gone back to your old habit for a night, but... did you? Or did a shade mysteriously make its way into your room, without leaving any traces on the main door or windows, and then open just your bedroom door in order to stand creepily over you with a floating blade?

    “...”

    It must have been a nightmare. A terrifyingly realistic one, but just a nightmare. Logically, there’s simply no way any of that could have been real.

    You wait out the rest of the night locked in the bathroom with the lights on, eventually passing out on the floor to wake up late and confused until you remember why you’re not in bed. Another double check; still no signs of anything. No liquid, no footsteps besides your own, nothing. No shade.

    ...

    Brother Trigg properly assigns the project. You’re studying corruption resistance through the lens of Erejil and half-Angels, which means even more grisly texts about deaths, mutilation, and the effects of exposure on Angels who venture into the wastelands. Reading about how your Body distorts, your Mind cracks, and your Soul frays. Not a light topic. Are you just addicted to misery?

    Your next magic course will be intermediate Mind. Internal projection, mostly, but the description includes a short introduction to transmutation and some external application as well. Interestingly enough, the instructor’s name is familiar too. Sister Veriline Noll, the monk who gave you the tour on your first day here. She did say she’s a Mind instructor, so you suppose you shouldn’t be surprised. The course doesn’t start for a bit, which gives you time to work on your project.

    Terrible dreams continue to assault you. Nothing as intense as the shade, but it’s rare that you can get a good night’s sleep anymore. You just have so many worries. Serri, Naoriel, your sickness, the kidnapper, Inquisitors, the corruption, betrayal, your fortune, and on and on. It’s a small mercy that your Angelic Body is capable of functioning despite your poor rest, though you seem to be coughing a little more often with your physical energy focused more on keeping you upright than healthy.

    It’s probably fine. Something will change soon. You’ll fix something; you can feel it.

    Winter fades. Spring approaches. The fog thins; the air warms. It’s still cold, but snow is starting to melt. You’ve made good progress with your project. Now it’s time for the practical experimentation portion.

    <em>Scene 97</em>
    Brother Trigg taps the sheaf of papers on the table to straighten it, then hands it back to you. “Your plan has been approved, though with the specified caveats listed on the front here. Namely, you’ll need to have two purification-certified Angels on site whenever you’re working with the corruption, and you’ll need to do all the experimentation in one of the wall sites. We can’t risk anything getting into the city by mistake.”

    You nod, accepting the papers. The plan is startlingly thick; it’s hard to believe you wrote it. Granted, it doesn’t help that a lot of the pages are just various standardized forms, but it was a lot of work regardless. “Do I need to find some Angels and a site on my own, or...?”

    “Already on page two. Along with the bishop’s signature, so we don’t have to worry about anyone getting a little too... overzealous if anything goes slightly off track.”

    He pauses; you know he’s referring to Sister Bagley and Yara’s experiment from last year. You were worried about that too, since your experiment is dealing with an even more dangerous substance: the corruption itself. So to protect yourself and Trigg, you made sure to clear the whole plan with one of the bishops. At least that way, if anyone gets in trouble, it won’t be someone you personally care about.

    You skim the pages he’s referring to; everything seems to make sense. “Okay. I think I’m ready, then.”

    “Good, good! Now, just one more check beforehand. I’ve seen your drafts and everything looks sensible so far, but is there anything about your topic that you have questions on? Anything whatsoever; I want you to be as prepared as you possibly can be before going into this.”

    “... Well, there is one thing...”

    “I’m all ears. How can I help?”

But, given that you’ve already halfway done so... “Half-Angels. I know they have really low corruption resistance, but what I just don’t get is why they’re...” It’s hard to say the word. “... executed. T-they’re blessed by God by Ascending, and it’s not like they <em>chose</em> who their parents are...”

    Brother Trigg nods slowly. “Jessamine, remember Erejil.”

    “I know, but you can just keep them in the city, where they won’t be exposed to any corruption!”

    “Corruption still enters the city. You should be well aware of that.”

    “In the Cathedra, then! They can be scholars, or healers, or teachers, or something like that!”

    “Corruption still enters the Cathedra,” he says softly.

    That’s not what you expected. “... What?”

    “Corruption is not just born from wasteland air or creatures of darkness. Corruption is a disease of the Soul, and broken Souls can generate it spontaneously.”

    “...”

    “Great suffering or severe trauma to the other aspects may damage the Soul as well. Ordinary people can lose their humanity and succumb to the darkness. You know this.”

    You... you do. Corrupted humans become Mindless darkness creatures if their Mind breaks, or shades if it stays intact. But... “That can happen even without any corruption at all? I know it can make it worse, but...?”

    “Without any prior corruption at all,” he confirms. “And half-Angels both have some of the most broken Souls of all, and will never die of old age.” A pause; he considers it. “That we know of, I suppose. There hasn’t been a known half-Angel who lived longer than Erejil. Regardless, that’s the reason. If a half-Angel were to fall to the corruption - whether through direct contact or spontaneously by losing control of their Soul - we would be met with a second Erejil. So far, no one has found any way to purify or repair a half-Angelic Soul, so any half-Angels are simply living on borrowed time before they become monsters.”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1231350450855346281 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1231350450855346281><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, April 20, 2024 5:07 PM">5:07 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“... But how can we figure out how to fix their Souls if we <em>keep killing them?”</em>

    “I don’t know.” He sighs. “But this is the path that the Cathedra has chosen. They don’t wish to risk another Erejil under any circumstances. And of course, they say, if Angels would simply stop attempting to have children, we wouldn’t have this problem at all.”

    “...”

    “Still not satisfied, I see. I’m afraid that’s all I know; there haven’t been any half-Angels since I joined the Cathedra. I was only a young boy for the last scare, and - God willing - there won’t be another.”

    “... Yeah.”

    That’s not a good enough reason, you think. Even if there’s a risk, the Cathedra should be studying how to <em>help</em> these people, not just <em>murdering</em> them. Even without the altruism, figuring out how to stabilize half-Angels would be a huge boon to the Cathedra logically as well, since then Angels could reproduce... normally, instead of just through Ascension. It just makes sense to do!

    So there has to be another reason why they aren’t. Maybe Brother Trigg doesn’t know it, but it has to be there. Another investigation to add to the list. But right now, you’ve only got a few days before your experiment is scheduled and you need to recruit some people for testing. Ideally, Angels with varying degrees of resistance, but you don’t have much of an idea how to determine that without the testing itself. Older Angels tend to have higher resistance than younger ones, but when controlling for age... well, that’s what you’re trying to figure out.

    So you start with your friends. Yara’s all in, of course, and you’re able to get Etalyn, Denn, Clarity (haven’t seen her in a while, but she’s still as hyper as ever), Serri (you almost didn’t ask, but she still seems perfectly friendly, though somewhat distant), not Jun (he’s too new; too risky), and even Erich (though you didn’t ask him; he invited himself) to agree to participate. However, when you go to ask Naoriel...

    “I’d just... rather not. The corruption and I don’t get along.”

    “Huh? You mean you have low resistance or a sensitivity or something? That’s <em>exactly</em> what I’m studying: what affects that kind of thing! Please? This isn’t one of those things you don’t talk about, is it?”

    After a few seconds of silence, you try a different tactic. “What about helping me run the experiment instead? You know, record data, manage equipment, that sort of thing? Since I’m sensitive to the corruption too, I can guarantee there won’t be any risk of exposure for us!”

    “Er, listen... I just... don’t think it would be a good idea.”

    You tilt your head in confusion. Naoriel’s helped you out with stuff before, including some significantly more arduous tasks. Why would she be so resistant to encountering the corruption at all? She’s going to have to later on when she graduates. You all will. That’s why you’re-

    You freeze midway through that thought. Something truly horrible has just occurred to you.

    Naoriel seems to notice your change of expression. “Alright, alright; geez! I’ll help out. It’s not that big a deal, actually.”

    “Er, right. Great; thanks a bunch! I’ll, um, give you the details later. I’ve got to... go.”

    “Jess-”

    Oh <em>God</em> no; how have you been so oblivious? Was it just because you didn’t <em>want</em> to notice?

    No. Breathe. Calm down; slow down. Think this through. There must be some mistake; some alternate explanation. If you just think it through rationally, you’ll see.

    You hide from the cold and melting snow in one of the little shrines dotted around the campus. Plus, Naoriel won’t think to look for you in here. You’ll talk to her about this later, but for now, you just need some time to think. This is the shrine of patience, you read from the plaque. Not exactly applicable to your current situation, but it’ll have to do. Okay. Think. You have to be wrong. Naoriel <em>cannot</em> be a half-Angel. Because if she were...

She claimed not to know who her mother is, but you’re sure she does. “Probably just some prostitute,” she had said, just before admitting she knew otherwise. Why would she need to hide that too, if her father’s identity is the problem? Maybe because her <em>mother’s</em> identity is the <em>bigger</em> problem. Because she’s an Angel.

    ... Stop. You’re supposed to be convincing yourself otherwise...

    Her weird magic training. Half-Angels have limited magical potential due to their warped Souls. Perhaps she was training in a special way, outside of the normal basic course. The weird <em>thing</em> about her Soul that you’ve been looking at for the past while but haven’t figured out how to describe? Her resistance to encountering the corruption just today. The...

    The kidnapper? “Bastard child,” he had said. As a prime’s child, that could fit, but as a half-Angel, it would be even more damning. Someone who knows and wants to use it as leverage over her? To what end?

    And the Inquisitors! They would care about the child of a prime, but to the extent of stalking her consistently for years? A possible half-Angel would be their top priority, of course.

    ... stop. you have to find another explanation. the real one.

    And, interestingly enough, that last thought is one that gives you pause. Inquisitors are good at what they do. They have to be, or the Cathedra will get corrupted. And if <em>you</em> - just some average Angel - figured it out, surely they would have gotten there first. Or at least brought her in for questioning or inspection or something. Not just... watched forever. They must have some compelling evidence against your idea to have not done <em>anything</em> for this long. Years.

    That makes you feel a little better. Maybe you’re just overreacting. A lot of this stuff can be explained just through her father, and the rest of it... could be a series of unlikely (but possible!) coincidences?

    Yes, that makes sense.

Yeah, that’s right.

    Eventually. You’ll clear this up eventually. Soon, probably. Just... not right now. And not tomorrow, either, because it’s... the day before the day before the experiment. Yeah, too much to prepare. The day after tomorrow’s out, too, and the day after that, well, you’ll be around other people all day. No time then either. So, when? Eventually. Later. You can wait a bit.

    So you do.

    “Say, Jessamine,” Yara asks as you pass by on your way to the control room. “Why is Naoriel a researcher today instead of a test subject? I thought we had truly bonded, you and I, as fellow survivors of an experiment gone awry, and yet you didn’t even ask if I would assist.” He pouts melodramatically. “Of course, I would have participated as a subject as well, which I’m certain you will be too. And yet the lovely Ms Fisher is exempt?”

    “W-well...”

    You struggle to come up with something that doesn’t seem suspicious. Yara has rarely looked so threatening, even though he’s just goofing around as he normally does. “Hm?”

    “I, er, d-don’t know.”

    “You don’t know?”

    “Sorry! Really busy! Gotta run!”

    You leave him staring after you in bemusement and hurry on to your original destination, not entirely sure why you’re so worried. You already decided that you’re probably wrong, right? And yet you’re still stressed out about something that probably isn’t even true? Okay, you’ve got to talk to her today. Later, of course, but you need to clear this up.

You’re working with recently-dead samples of wasteland plants, which is about as low-risk as you can get with the corruption. Even regular humans would be able to withstand everything you’ve got today without serious harm, and Angels should barely be able to feel it. And as you start through your pool of subjects, that seems to be the case. Yara, Etalyn, Clarity, some of her full Angel friends, on down the list: you note hardly any effect on their Souls even with your enhanced sensitivity and the mechanical device Yara and Brother Trigg helped you assemble.

    Naoriel doesn’t have your eye for Souls, so she’s mostly double checking your observations and helping you write down the results without having to look away. That and adjusting the machine, since you’re not very familiar with the controls but she’s apparently used one before. (Why?)

    In fact, after the first few results are barely discernible from each other, you’re a little worried the whole experiment will be a flop. Plus, that blessed glass between you and the main chamber - the one that’s meant to stop any corruption from affecting you in the control room - doesn’t seem to be working quite as well as advertised. You don’t feel the urge to cry like you did atop the wall, but there remains a definite sense of uneasy malice - dulled, but still detectable - from the other room.

    So. Even a few dead plants are enough, huh? You suppose that’s valuable data. You’ll be going last, because of course Yara was correct that you’d participate in your own experiment. You just hope you won’t suffer yet another humiliating collapse as you try. Not least because you won’t be able to record your own data properly if you do that.

    “Sounds sensible.” Naoriel fiddles with the machine, checking its charge for the rest of the tests.

    “So, um, I don’t think the glass is quite as good as they think it is. I keep feeling... sort of anger - or hate - from the plants. And that’s just dead plants. I mean, what would this do against a <em>real</em> darkness creature?” A pause. “Er, do you feel it too?”

    <em>Scene 99</em>
    “...”

    “Jessamine?”

    “We need to talk after this.”

    She looks at you, expression somewhere between quizzical and concerned. “About what?”

    “Later. Not now; not here. But, right after this. Okay?”

    “... Okay.”

    A resolute nod. You’re going to deal with it, and soon. Now that Naoriel knows about your intent, you can’t chicken out anymore. Only a little longer.

    The remaining Angels are more varied, and mostly younger. You do get some more significant effects on their Souls, which is relieving because you’ll actually have some data to work with, but also slightly concerning to watch as the light dims or shifts. Not enough to be concerning - and no one passes out, obviously - but... it’s still uncomfortable to see.

    Finally, everyone else has gone and it’s your turn to step into the chamber. With Naoriel watching from the control room, you take a deep breath, think <em>“Whatever you do, don’t pass out this time”</em> to yourself, and enter.

    It’s... not as bad as you thought it might be. You can still sense malice from the dead plants, but it’s faded. More immediate than it was in the control room behind that glass, but not enough to harm you. No crying today and definitely no collapsing on the floor - thankfully, you’re not <em>that</em> pathetic. Instead, you just quickly work through the testing program you developed, standing in various places and interacting with the plants in various ways with your Soul in various phases. Then, once that’s all done, out you go again to review the results and do a final check with the purifier Angels. Someone from the wall has already come in to take the plants away for destruction. No one wants to keep them around any longer than necessary.

Everything went fine. No one got hurt, you got some reasonable data, and generally just nothing went wrong. You couldn’t have asked for a better result. A few of your friends even help you and Naoriel clean up, which is nice <em>but</em> does mean you can’t ask her anything until that’s all done.

    And when it finally is, once you’ve called for a train and are sitting around with everyone else on the station platform, Naoriel finds you. “So, what was it you wanted to talk about?”

    The anxious knot quickly reforms. This is what you wanted, though! You probably wouldn’t have gone through with it if she hadn’t. “Er, not... around everyone else. Maybe over that way?”

    You’re close to the farms out here by the wall, so there’s a large amount of open space closer to the city. It’s not surrounded by walls, but you can talk quietly and enhance your senses to make sure no one’s sneaking up on you. Maybe even better than a room in the bunker, since you don’t know the layout or if anyone’s monitoring the place. Honestly, you’d be surprised if no one was.

    “Okay. Something secret?” Great, now she’s nervous too.

    “Y-yeah.”

    But as you start heading in that direction, one of the purifier Angels hurries up from around the building, heading straight for you. “Ms Fisher, Ms Goodall,” he says as he arrives, nodding politely to you both. “Would either of you happen to have lost a white beret during the experiment today?”

    You exhale in relief. Nothing problematic. Naoriel pats her head. “You found it? I don’t even know how I lost it; I didn’t take it off or anything!”

    “Ah, excellent! My partner found it while we were cleaning up; would you come with me for a moment to come get it?”

    “Er, sure. Jessamine, back in a minute. Don’t let the train leave without me, okay?”

    “Gotcha.”

You turn around, squinting towards the horizon to see if you can spot the incoming train. Interrupted just before you were about to sort it out, and now you probably won’t even have time before heading back to the Cathedra. It’ll have to be later, after all. Still, at least she knows now so she won’t-

    You blink a few times, turning towards the building again.

    They passed the main doors. Why would her hat be outside? <em>How</em> would it be outside? You never left the bunker even once after entering through those very doors. Confused, you sort of lightly jog off the platform back towards the wall, craning your neck as if you had maybe just missed them entering the doors like would be sensible.

    Something doesn’t feel right.

    “Hey, Jess! Train’s here!” someone calls. Clarity, maybe? You shout something back - you’re not even sure what - and wave for someone to follow. But mostly, you just sprint as fast as you can towards the corner of that building, trusting in your instinct that something is terribly wrong here. Tightness in your chest. You can hear your heartbeat, even though you’ve only just started running. You’re not going to be too late. You <em>will not.</em>

    A sudden surge of warmth, even on the chilly March afternoon. Your Soul switches phases instantly, just like that night you faced the kidnapper, and you race along the path with magic-enhanced speed. Someone yells something behind you, but it’s too distant and you’re too distracted. It doesn’t matter. Everyone else is too far away.

    You skid around the corner and have only an instant to understand what’s going on as a loud <em>crack</em> whips through the air. Naoriel and the purifier Angel are walking along the rear of the building, towards where it meets the wall. The other purifier Angel is smiling and walking towards them, holding the beret.

The trajectory... too fast. You have to do something, now!

    <em>Scene 100</em>
    You’re stronger than you were just a few months ago. Even though you haven’t been specifically practicing physical magic, you still learned the basics. And you <em>know</em> you can do this one, since you did before. The air pulls in, drawing from all around you in a brief, powerful vortex. Then, in an instant of painful tension on your Soul as you strain it to your limit, release. A blast of wind rushes out, racing against the falling stone.

    Impact. You’re almost knocked off your feet by the heavy shock as the ground trembles. Too much dust in the air. Is anyone okay? You hurry forward, hearing alarmed shouts from somewhere behind; still too far.

    The first purifier Angel looms out of the dust cloud like a phantom, expression twisted into a snarl. He grabs your wrist before you have time to react, yanking you away from the shattered rock and ominous quiet. “You again. I should have known.” A pause; a glance towards the rapidly-closing voices of your friends. “Tell them this was all an accident; understand? Or I’ll have to stop caring about witnesses.”

    You don’t know how to respond, but you’re absolutely certain of one thing: this is the kidnapper. The betrayer Angel who invaded Hearth Hall last time has evolved to attempting murder in broad daylight. You - you have to do something, but...

    “This isn’t over,” he promises, before launching backwards into the air and rocketing upwards on wings of light. Gone in an instant, just before your friends make it around the corner. The second purifier Angel has also vanished. Was he ever <em>actually</em> there?

    Etalyn’s in the lead, blade out, followed by Yara and Clarity. “Jess, what happened?!” someone calls. “Is anyone hurt?”

    “I - I don’t - Naoriel-!”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1233600840783101982 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1233600840783101982><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 26, 2024 10:09 PM">10:09 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The dust has started to clear by now and you blow more of it away with another gust of wind (though it’s now much harder to control and Yara has to help). The massive chunk of stone has sunk nearly half a foot into the softer dirt and shattered fragments coat the ground in gravel. “I t-tried to push her away, but I don’t know - too fast-”

    “Here. Hurry.” Etalyn waves you over to the other side of the rock, closer to the wall. You see the blood first.

    Naoriel is lying unconscious on her stomach, arms outspread as if to break a fall. Her left leg past the knee and right leg past the shin are pinned under the stone; even from a quick glance you can tell they’re both mostly pulverized. Deep, rich blood flows into the ground; you’re struck again by just how <em>dark</em> it is.

    “Help me lift this,” Etalyn says, nodding you and Yara to the side. “Clarity, can you stop the bleeding?”

    “Once she’s out, yes.”

    “Then help me lift the rock.”

    More Angels arrive, wondering what the noise was. Etalyn, Yara, and Clarity are joined by two more adult Angels - including the purifier whose appearance the kidnapper had stolen - and manage to heft the bulk of the rock up and away to thud into the ground nearby. Immediately afterwards, Clarity and the purifier kneel and start to close the wounds.

    Well, sort of. There’s not much that can be done for anything caught under the boulder’s main mass. You have to look away, feeling sick, as both of her legs come away much shorter than they used to be. They can fix that. Surely.

    ...

    Trains come and go. Naoriel is rushed back to the Cathedra along with the healers. Everyone else has to stay put. Someone comes by to inspect the wall. A very serious-looking Angel begins to interview everyone present about what they saw. You can’t bring yourself to say anything when they ask. He presses, but you just...

    “Alright, that’s enough. Move on. I’ll speak with her.”

A distinguished man with a mustache and deep blue badge on his vest sits down in the other chair. You’ve been moved inside at some point. There’s no one else here. You start to come back to life a little when you notice he isn’t an Angel. No perfectly symmetrical features; much older than his twenties. And that blue badge...

    “Jessamine. Look up, please.”

    ... You look up. He has deep creases around his eyes.

    “My name is Lewis Kin. I am a prime of the Cathedra and the head of Inquisition.”

    A sharp intake of breath. “The Angel asking questions-”

    “One of my Inquisitors. Jessamine, I’ll start by saying Naoriel will live. I know you’ve become quite close with her over the past few months.”

    “...” Relief, but he’s studying you. Those eyes aren’t gold like the Emissary’s, but they’re just as discerning.

    “I need to know. What happened today? And was it truly just an accident?”

    “... I... um...”

    He waits patiently. What are you supposed to say? If you tell him... <em>“I’ll have to stop caring about witnesses,”</em> the kidnapper had said. B-but, if you don’t... This is the man who’s been stalking her for years! How much does he know? Is this just a test?

    “Can’t decide whether to tell the truth?”

    You flinch, despite desperately trying not to.

    “I understand. Maybe I can ease your fears.” He taps on the wall, looking away from you for a brief moment. “Seal this room. Don’t allow anyone to listen in. And that includes yourselves.”

    A brief pause. You feel a pulse of magic wash over you from several directions.

    “The Inquisitors are very loyal, and <em>very</em> good at their jobs. No one will hear anything you have to say except me. And, similarly, no one will hear anything <em>I</em> have to say, either.”

    “...”

    “We’ve been watching Naoriel since she Ascended. Why? Don’t you know?”

    “I... don’t-”

    “Do not lie to me. I will not tolerate it.” He closes one of his hands into a fist - briefly, softly, but noticeably - then releases it. “Why?”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1233600919170715678 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1233600919170715678><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 26, 2024 10:09 PM">10:09 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>... What are you supposed to do? Does he <em>really</em> know, or is he trying to get information out of you? You... you can’t say. No matter what. “I promised not to talk about it.”

    The prime nods, seemingly surprised. “Determined, are you? Very well, I’ll respect that.” A deep inhale. “We are watching Naoriel because she has suspect parentage and shows physical signs of potential corruption.” You do your best not to react when he continues with the very thing you had intended to clear up with her just earlier today. “In brief, certain members of the Cathedra are suspicious that Naoriel is a half-Angel.”

    “...”

    “They are correct.”

    You feel like you’ve been punched in the gut. Of course, you had your suspicious, but - but <em>the head Inquisitor?!</em> “Er - but you... aren’t you supposed to-”

    <em>“One of the primes,”</em> she had said. Her father.

    “You’re her dad.”

    He nods. “Lewis Fisher, at your service. Head Inquisitor and the very man in charge of executing my own daughter.”

    Everything falls into place. The reason Inquisitors have been investigating her for years, but haven’t <em>done</em> anything. It’s not because they’re incompetent or have secret evidence to exonerate her. It’s because her father - <em>the head of Inquisition</em> - is protecting her.

    “Y-you... you’re - <em>why?!”</em>

    “I frequently ask myself that. Why do I bother, when I know I will fail? Do I truly care for her, or is it just a way of extending my own life after my atrocious sin? Regardless of <em>why</em>, I <em>do</em>. I’ve heard quite a lot about you from her, you know, and it seems she believes you want to help her as well. Is that true?”

    “... Yes.” You’ve completely lost control of the conversation. As if you ever had it.

    “Well then. I believe I’ve spoken quite enough. Have you yet made up your Mind? Will you tell the truth?”

    “...”

    <em>Scene 101</em>
    “... It wasn’t an accident. And this isn’t the first time, either.”

    The prime stays quiet, inviting you to continue. With some difficulty, you do. The betrayer, their flawless disguises and wings undoubtedly marking them as an Archangel in reality. You hadn’t been sure last time - maybe they just slowed their fall? - but <em>this</em> time they definitely flew away. Warnings from the betrayer echo in your Mind as you speak, but surely - of anyone you could possibly tell - this man will understand the value of secrecy. As long as no one else finds out.

    When you’re finished, he simply nods. “This explanation fits with some other incidents recently. It’s likely an Angel who feels very strongly that they must eliminate any hybrids, yet also feels they can’t simply reveal their information.”

    “But... why? Half-Angels are always executed; if they knew, it would be so easy to just... tell someone.”

    “Who knows? Perhaps they just don’t want to make a fuss.”

    “... Are you going to... do anything about them?”

    “Likely. Though we’ll have to be careful if their warnings to you are to be believed. And any sort of official inquiry will be... complicated.”

    “Yeah...”

    “Regardless, thank you for your account of the situation, and for looking out for Naoriel. Please continue to do so.”

    You nod. “Er, i-if you don’t Mind... why did you tell me who you are? Just to make me tell you the truth?”

Many of them don’t even require magic. Rather, Naoriel already decided to trust you when she decided to try to become your friend. From that point, it was a certainty you’d find out eventually. So I decided to trust you as well... though not without a little investigation first.” A pause; you wonder how much <em>you’ve</em> been stalked, too. “Naoriel will need all the help she can get when the time finally comes, and I won’t be able to do much beyond delaying that time. At the end of the day, once my sin is discovered and my authority taken, I’m only a man. <em>You</em>, and her other friends, have the chance to <em>truly</em> save her.”

    “...” That’s a lot of responsibility. A lot of faith. You’re not sure you can live up to it, but you’re not about to say no. “I’ll do my best.”

    “Good. Now, it’s about time we get moving. I have an investigation to complete, and you need to return to the Cathedra.”

    ...

    “I... talked to your dad yesterday.”

    “You <em>what?”</em>

    It’s the next day. Naoriel was released from the hospital this morning, legs back to the way they should be and with the right amount of blood again. Magic can do some truly miraculous things. The investigation is still ongoing, but gossip is already circulating that the Inquisitors believe it wasn’t an accident. An unnatural shear line in the rock, combined with testimonies from the purifier Angels (who had both been indoors at the time they were supposedly out back) and others who had seen their duplicates. The betrayer made a mistake, it seems, even without your specific information.

    The weather is terrible. Slushy precipitation that can’t decide if it wants to be rain or snow or a mix of both. Everyone with any sense is inside today, which is why you and Naoriel are out here in a sort of pavilion thing near the edge of campus. You need to talk, and you need no one to overhear. You’ve already gone over the basics at the hospital, but now...

    “Hold on; wait a minute. <em>Who?</em> Specifically.”

    “...” You’re still feeling paranoid, even though you’re out of the way in this remote location. “Th-the prime of Inquisition,” you whisper.

    She winces. “That’s him. Why - wait, did you find out, or did he <em>tell</em> you, or...?”

    “A little of both. But... I wouldn’t have known if he hadn’t said anything.” A pause; you need to just blurt it out. “And!” Shush. Lower your voice. “And. Your mother... sh-she’s an Angel.”

    “... That’s why you’ve been acting weird.”

    “... Yeah.”

    “How... did you find out?”

    So it’s true. Even with all your evidence; even with the prime’s affirmation, you had still kind of hoped that maybe you were still wrong. But now... you can’t deny it any longer. “A lot of things just added up. Then, when I learned about half-Angels for my project on corruption resistance, I... that’s when I figured it out.”

    A little half-laugh. “Now you know why I didn’t want to participate!”

    “Y-yeah.”

    “Well. Okay, Jess. You got me. Bastard child of a terrible sin. So, when’s the execution?”

    “Wh-what? I wouldn’t - I’m not going to tell anybody!”

    Naoriel stares at you for several long seconds. Those purple eyes, still unnatural, but now with some sort of explanation. “Don’t you know what will happen eventually? Didn’t you read about this in your research? I’m not going to get a chance; even if they don’t kill me, my Soul is too unstable. I’ll destroy myself eventually. It’ll be a second Erejil.” Another pause; she looks away. “Now you know why I don’t like that story either.”

    “We... we can’t just give up! The Cathedra doesn’t know everything! They just keep killing half-Angels because they’re scared of it happening again, but <em>we can fix Souls!</em> It’s risky, and no one’s done it yet for a half-Angel, but that’s just because no one’s really tried! It has to be possible. We just need to figure out how.”

They’re not going to suddenly change the rules just because some trainees think they’re special.”

    You start to say something, but realize you don’t know what to say. She’s right. “But-”

    “But that doesn’t mean I want to give up either.” She looks you in the eyes again. “Jessamine, I don’t want to die. Just in case you were worried after all that. I haven’t just been sitting around doing nothing, and my dad’s been helping look too. But... he can’t cast magic and I’m not very good at it. You, er, you know that half-Angels have trouble casting spells because of the way their Soul works, right?”

    You nod. “The books say that because it’s half-Angelic to start with, Ascension doesn’t work quite right and things just stay messed up. It’s hard to move it purposefully.”

    “I guess. But in any case, to even think about doing some sort of... <em>cure</em>... we’d need one of the best Soul transmuters ever. Probably <em>the</em> best. And a spell that no one’s ever cast before or even really done much research into. And to figure all of this out before anyone who isn’t as nice as you learns what’s going on, <em>or</em> I spontaneously destroy myself by getting too mad or something!” A pause; she glances at you while counting all the problems on her fingers. “And so far, we have my dad who can’t cast spells, me who also isn’t going to be good enough, and - if you’re serious - you, who (unless you’re hiding something) are also not a grandmaster Soul transmuter with a century of experience. <em>And</em> there’s also that Archangel who seemingly <em>does</em> know, but wants to just murder me personally instead of telling anyone!”

    “...”

    “Sorry. It’s just, there’s a lot of problems. It’s hard to stay optimistic, you know?”

    “... Yeah.”

    “That’s fine. It’s not going to.”

    “How are you so hopeful?”

    You carefully shove down the memories of your fortune - the Fallen Angel and the Spy indicating a betrayal from a secret getting out - and do your best to stay optimistic. “I guess I’m just a very positive person.”

    A lie. But, hopefully, you’ll be correct regardless.

    <em>Scene 102</em>
    Despite the recent revelations, nothing in particular happens - and in fact matters improve somewhat - over the next few months. The betrayer does not appear again, no one calls out or executes Naoriel, and you start your new magic course in mid March.

    Sister Noll doesn’t go easy on you just because you’d met before. “Internal Mind magic is about perception and defense,” she tells you on the first day, as you stand awkwardly in the sparring grounds holding a seemingly non-Mind-related wooden sword. “Your first course taught you the basics of perception and focus, but nothing of defense.”

    “Er, Mental defense, right? Not...” You gesture with the sword, hoping she gets the idea.

    “Both! A competent Angel uses their Mind as much as their Body in physical combat. With practice, you can block out the corruption and still accelerate your own thinking to guide your Body with minute precision. But that will come later. To start with, let’s work on your more basic Mental defenses.”

    “Okay.” A pause. You still haven’t had your implied question answered. “So, the sword...?”

    “For realism. You don’t think you’re going to be just sitting in a perfectly quiet environment while having to defend yourself, do you? Come on; show me the skills you’ve built up during your first year. Focus!”

    ... Yeah. Things went on like that for a while. You often came back from your Mind course more beat up than from your Body one. But you have to admit it has been effective, both in Mental technique and in swordplay. Your focus is improving and you’re becoming more adept at purging external presences from your Mind. And also getting clobbered by Noll’s blade less often - though you’ve still got a long way to go on that front. It’s probably a good thing she works with Angels; it feels like you would have gotten seriously hurt if you were still a normal human. As-is, you’re usually feeling better within a few hours.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1235035192616550412 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1235035192616550412><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 30, 2024 9:08 PM">9:08 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Anyway, this new defensive training is probably why your nightmares seem to be getting less intense. Or at least, that’s what you’re going to believe. You haven’t seen that terrifyingly realistic shade again, and it’s now much more rare to get the kind of dream where you’re betrayed or murdered or hunted endlessly. A full night’s sleep returns to a more ordinary occurrence, and your health improves correspondingly. Fewer coughs; it feels like you’re finally making some progress with the miracle for your lungs. You finally managed to make it stop hurting, and the Soul motion to cast it is starting to become second nature.

    Things, in brief, are looking up.

    You even have some time with all the self-improvement to get together with Yara, Clarity, Denn, Erich (ugh), and Serri to learn disguise magic, because you’re allowed to now and you’re totally not spreading yourself too thin. Actually, you’re kind of surprised Erich hadn’t already learned it; he’s been a second year for a while. It’s even more surprising that he’s willing to join up with you and everyone to learn together; maybe Denn asked him? He’s about the only one of the group friendly enough with Erich for that to make sense.

    Naoriel, to avoid any awkward questions, skips out on the main group; you insinuate to the others that she just doesn’t want to be around Erich. Which, luckily, is plausible because he really does not like her at all. Instead, she practices with you and Yara later, since he’s trustworthy enough to not say anything if you ask him not to. You do contemplate trying to bring him in on the secret entirely, but Naoriel’s understandably reluctant to tell anyone else without an extremely good reason. You figure he might find out on his own eventually anyway. He’s sharp like that.

It feels very different from Mental projection in ways you have trouble putting into words. At least you’re not trying the transmutation variant where you’d be manipulating your actual Body; thinking about that sort of thing gives you the creeps. What if you accidentally lost concentration for a moment and moved your arm where your leg should go?

    At least with projections, it’s all illusory. You’re not changing your Body in any “real” sense - you’re just adding a different appearance on top of it. You’re not entirely sure how that makes sense - projections can only add or subtract the target aspect, and you’re not adding or removing flesh and bone - but Clarity explains that you’re “adding Body in the sense of <em>appearance</em>, not in the physical sense.”

    Sure. Whatever that means.

    Erich is annoyingly good at this too, able to change his hair color on the very first day and quickly progressing to more complicated illusions faster than anyone else. However, with Serri focusing on Body projection in her courses, she’s actually got an advantage on you and manages to turn around her performance in the basic magic course. Good for her! Not good for you, though; it’s kind of embarrassing having <em>everyone else</em> give you tips as you struggle to grasp your Soul properly. For some reason, it’s hard for you to visualize your appearance, which makes it a lot more difficult to direct how you want your Soul to move.

    Erich suggests a mirror. You roll your eyes, until he emphasizes he’s being serious. With that tone, you figured he was just making fun of you. Maybe that’s just his default voice.

    ... It does help to look at yourself as you practice, reminding you what you actually look like and what you want to change. Darn Erich having a good idea for once.

All your investigations have been on hold as well; you’ve just been so focused.

    But. Here you are. August 14th - Endle Day - is almost here. It’s been nearly one whole year since the last time you went home. You’re stronger now, but are you <em>really</em> ready to try that again? Seth and your parents have been understanding in their letters, but somehow you feel like they’re just saying that. Like you’re betraying them by not coming home.

    But returning just because of that feeling wouldn’t be fair either, would it?

    <em>Scene 103</em>
    “...”

    The train feels different today. Maybe it’s because this is your first time traveling on your own, without anyone else to sit with or talk to. That makes sense.

    You’re only barely adept enough at disguise magic to get out of the Cathedra under your own power, a mirror of the first time you left after just learning to suppress your glow the day before. The gate guards had to consider your appearance for longer than usual, checking to make sure you didn’t miss anything with your magic. You didn’t, but the disguise is fragile and weaker than Clarity’s or Yara’s. You have to keep your focus in order to keep it up, and you still look perhaps more pretty or graceful than an ordinary girl your age should. Still, it’s within the bounds of humanly possible. You’re fine.

    The weather is hot and sunny, much like last year. You’re continuously grateful for your Angelic Body that resists the heat without even needing to sweat (at least, not much). The people around you seem almost gross by comparison, even though you know that’s just what normal people look like. It’s not like you’ve been completely isolated and forgotten what non-Angels are (your instructors and other Cathedra staff, for one) but you’ve... kind of been having similar thoughts about them sometimes. Only occasionally, though! You don’t look down on anyone, not like Erich!

    So you do your best to be as polite as you can, pressed against the window due to the unfortunate girth of the sweaty gentleman in the seat next to you. It’s not his fault and he is trying to be polite by shuffling a little into the aisle; this is just the reality of too many people and not enough seats on the train. At least the windows are partially open today, letting out the heat and letting in the breeze. It’s a real relief when the train makes it out of downtown and more people start leaving at each stop than boarding.

    You miss the private trains that are your privilege with the Cathedra.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1235751147629711481 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1235751147629711481><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, May 2, 2024 8:33 PM">8:33 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Anyway, here you are at your stop. You squeeze past your seatmate and the other people in the aisle, emerging into the station’s somewhat-fresher air. Then, without much of a reason to stick around, into the same city streets you last walked almost exactly one year ago. Just about down to the minute, actually; the train schedule hasn’t changed much and you’re pretty sure you took the same one.

    The neighborhood hasn’t changed much either... Hum. No, maybe it has. Something seems off as you walk down the not-quite-familiar-anymore streets, and it’s not the same thing that felt off last time. You’re still nervous about meeting your family again, sure, but you don’t quite feel the same sense of alienation. This time, the streets just feel... wary? On edge. There’s anticipation leaking from the cobbles and buildings here, and it seems to be following you. The area is <em>aware</em> of you, and it intends to <em>do</em> something about your presence.

    Does that even make sense? Objects don’t have Minds; they can’t think like that. And yet... <em>corrupted</em> objects can. You know they can, because those flowers hated you. The wastelands hate you. This sensation is sort of like that, but not quite so violent. The streets don’t hate you. They’re just watching. Carefully. A slight shiver; you glance back uneasily.

    You can’t see any more details than that, since you’d have to shift your Soul’s phase to something other than Body to read Mind or Soul clues. But, obviously, you can’t do that without dropping your disguise. That’s the main disadvantage of projection over transmutation - you can only do one thing at a time - and it’s already annoying you enough to consider learning transmutation. Everyone says it’s really hard, though, so maybe slow down a little with that ambition.

There are some people around, and you suppose you wouldn’t expect too many here on Endle Day, but you can often go a whole block without anyone in sight. Is there something else going on? It is a holiday; maybe everyone’s just out at one festival or another?

    You resolve to ask the next person you see, and that next person happens to be a girl probably a few years older than you. She steps out of a house midway down the block, failing to turn and close the door, then wanders off in the same direction you’re going. You figure that shouting to get the attention of a perfect stranger is probably a little much, so you quicken your step a bit to close the distance. The hourly bell starts to chime; you’re now officially late. That’s not entirely your fault - the train was delayed due to hectic holiday crowds - but you should hurry up. Maybe you can just ask your family, actually, and then you won’t need to interact with anyone else.

    But why is she walking so weird? You have a fair amount of time to stare (not creepily!) as you catch up, and her steps are oddly monotone. Your current attunement to Body makes it more obvious that this isn’t her natural gait, though you really wish you could dip into Mind for a moment to figure out what she might be thinking. There’s no one immediately visible in the house she just left either; no parents or siblings to get annoyed about her leaving the door open. You almost close the door, but maybe there’s a reason; you probably shouldn’t interfere, just to be safe. Maybe this is some kind of weird game, like hide and seek but you have to step in a certain way to count down?

    The girl turns left at the next intersection; you need to go straight. So, you...

    <em>Scene 104</em>
    Go straight. It’s not that you don’t have any suspicion about the situation, but really, the odds that you’re just misreading something and will be butting into someone else’s business are much higher than there being an actual problem you could possibly do anything about. Plus, you’re already late and you can get information on the district from your family anyway. You leave the girl to her wandering and continue on your way.

    But, even though you should be hurrying due to the time, you start to slow down a little as you get close. Anxiety. Nervousness. A bit of dissociation - that’s the same as last time - slips back into your Mind. No; you’re stronger than this now. You. Can. Do. This.

    So you stop, just for a minute. Place your hands on a cool metal streetlamp. Close your eyes. You still can’t shift over to Mind because someone could show up at any moment, but you can calm yourself using nonmagical means. Focus on the texture of the stem you’re gripping. None of those abstract worries are necessary right now. Back to their compartments. All you need is yourself, right now.

    ... Maybe that helped a little? You can’t really tell; you’re still nervous. Okay, you’ll just cheat when you get inside; you can drop your disguise there and use Mind magic. Despite Noll’s insistence that you should only rely on the technique against the corruption or in other extreme situations, she still taught you how to directly bolster your own emotions. You’re not very good at it yet, as she’s been focusing mainly on more broad applications, but you <em>can</em> do it. Projection: adding or removing the aspect. You will be able to simply remove your own fear once you get out of the street.

Ha, nonmagical means to calm down by <em>thinking</em> about magic. Does that count? Noll probably wouldn’t be impressed. You manage a little grin and let go of the lamp, opening your eyes and continuing to your destination.

    Okay, go. Do it. Raise your hand. And.

    “...”

    Second try. Go on; raise your hand. And.

    Knock.

    You hear some thumping from inside, followed by the door being very quickly thrown open. “Jess’s here!” Seth shouts back into the house, before ushering you in. “And she’s late!”

    “H-hey,” you protest. “The train was late. I can’t do anything about that!”

    “Aw, you still can’t fly yet? They’re keeping all the cool spells from you.”

    “Well-”

    It feels surprisingly natural this time. Much of your anxiety drops away as you and Seth bicker like you always do. As dad comes in from the back where he’d been tinkering with the pipes. As mom hurries down from upstairs, also running late. As everyone gives you a hug. This is more like it. More normal; more real. The echoes of last time already feel almost like a bad dream. It’s been so long, but everything’s okay now. You’re fine.

    That’s such a relief.

    “So, er, where is everybody?” you ask a while later, sitting at the table with Seth while your parents finish cleaning nearby. Normally one or both of you would be helping them, but you’ve both been told to stay put this time. Seth seems to know something you don’t. Surprises make you nervous. “I only saw a few people once I left the station.”

    “Hm? Probably just out enjoying the festivals. We don’t have one here and most people don’t stay home today.”

    “... Okay, I guess that makes sense.” It does, but you’re still a little uneasy. Was it this empty last year? You can’t quite remember. “It just feels a little weird today.”

    “I was just, er, busy...”

    “Learning more cool magic? What can you do now?”

    “Uh...” You hesitate, thinking through all the magic you know. Most of it is Mental and internal, which isn’t really impressive for an observer. <em>“Watch as I purge my Mind of external influences!”</em> And then literally nothing happens. Yeah, right. “Um... I can do my disguise spell on my own now.”

    “Eh? Does that mean you can make yourself look different, too? Can you look like me?”

    “W-well...” No, not really. Disguise-by-projection is a tricky subject and you’ve been pestering your Body instructor about the theory behind it, since you still don’t get why it isn’t transmutation. One thing that’s sort of critical to the spell is that you can only change your appearance by projection to things you can visualize as “you.” So, you can make yourself look like a normal version of you instead of an Angelic version, but you can’t make yourself look like your brother. That’s because you can’t see yourself as being him, so your Body aspect doesn’t contain anything you can add or remove to get to that endpoint.

    Does that make sense? So you can “remove” the divinity from your Body using projection in order to do your disguise spell, but you can’t “add” your brother to your own appearance. Even though it sort of seems like you should be able to, you just can’t. You can “add” age to see what you might look like in the future, but it’s just a guess based on your own conception. (As a sidenote, you can’t do that either, even though projection would let you, because you have such trouble visualizing your own appearance even in the present day, let alone in the future.)

Which actually makes what Erich did on his first day even more puzzling, since he changed his hair color. Assuming he doesn’t dye his hair regularly enough to see black hair as part of “himself,” that means he must have been using transmutation. Which is <em>really, really weird</em> given that he was otherwise learning projection magic like everyone else the rest of the time. Was he pretending? Did he somehow learn transmutation <em>before</em> projection? It just doesn’t make sense and you haven’t decided if you want to ask him yet.

    “Jess?”

    Oh, shoot. How long have you been spacing out? “N-no, I can’t. Because... er...” How are you supposed to explain all that to Seth? You barely even grasp it yourself! “Weird magic rules.” You wiggle your fingers mysteriously. “It’s God’s will~”

    “Yeah, right.”

    Well, it was worth a try.

    Seth has continued his training to become a soldier, passing the first entrance exam and now beginning to work with real soldiers as his instructors. He speaks excitedly about the others in his cohort and of learning new weapons and combat styles to one day keep up with Angels in the field. He’s got a wooden sword here just like you use during combat courses, but also a number of other training weapons for various ranges and roles. One thing he doesn’t have here, though is very keen to learn in his next year, is a rifle.

Angels typically don’t - they tend to use physical magic for ranged combat - but soldiers need ways of dealing with corrupted beasts at a safe distance. Traditional bows and arrows aren’t sufficiently damaging, so modern technology is starting to provide alternatives. It makes you nervous to think that, with something like that, anyone could shoot you dead before you even knew they were there. Your Body is resilient and heals quickly, but you’re not invincible. If the corruption were to gain such technology...

    Oh, God, he wants to fight you. Just for fun, obviously, and with wooden weapons, but you’re immediately reminded of Serri’s challenge last year. You’ve gotten better since then, but he’s been training in combat for longer and with more focus than you. And of course, with your sickness... is this a good idea?

    <em>Scene 105</em>
    Well... you’ve been doing better recently and Seth seems really excited. Plus, you’re supposed to not let the sickness affect your life, because that’s how it got into your Soul in the first place. So, despite some reservations, you accept his challenge.

    “But I’m not going to use any magic, okay?”

    “Why not?”

    “Well, it wouldn’t be fair, would it?” And, though you obviously don’t want to tell him this, you’re at much lower risk of exhausting yourself if you only fight physically. <em>Plus</em>, you belatedly realize, your focus is already tied up maintaining your disguise. Dropping that anywhere outside - since of course you can’t have a sparring match in the house - would probably not be a good idea.

    There’s a small, relatively enclosed park nearby that probably won’t be too busy with all the neighborhood residents away at various festivals. So, after securing your parents’ (marginally reluctant) blessing, off you go with Seth to beat each other with sticks. You could probably phrase that better.

    The match is under the same standard rules as the one with Serri, though with your dad as referee instead of Etalyn: minimal armor and first to three hits wins. Seth picks a sword to match yours, though his is larger than you typically train with. Starmetal weapons don’t need as much weight behind them, since Angels are so strong and starmetal is so durable that the speed makes up for it. It always makes you nervous to train with a real blade - as you have a few times since March - because the edge is so sharp. At least here the worst you’ll do is bruise.

    “Three... two... one... Go!”

Well, sort of. He’s certainly aggressive and fast, though you’re actually faster with your enhanced Body and Mind heightening your reactions. But he’s good at anticipating your strikes and moving aside before you can use that speed to actually hit him. You can feel your grip on the disguise spell slipping as you have to devote more attention to keeping yourself away from his blade; another disadvantage over projection. At this rate, you’re going to have to let it go or get hit.

    Neither one sounds good. Without magic, you don’t have nearly as many tricks available, but that doesn’t mean you can’t try something stupid anyway. You’re light, but very strong for your size. Surprisingly so. Enough that you can jump much higher than anyone would expect if they didn’t know your ability. Enough to trick him? You go in for your next exchange at a side angle, aiming to bait out a lower swipe, and just <em>leap</em> when it comes.

    You don’t go sailing clear over his head, but you do manage to clobber him in the shoulder on the way past, then again in the side as he turns to respond. Unfortunately, your triumph is short-lived as he whacks you in the leg - seemingly in <em>exactly</em> the same spot Serri did - and you whiff the landing. A brief tumble leaves you completely open for a second and you brace for him to finish the fight with two quick stabs.

    But he just steps back, allowing you to stand up.

    “Wait, why-”

    And then he just about skewers you through the chest with that heavy blade. You react in time to block, but not enough to dodge, and Seth’s strength combined with the sword’s weight means you just can’t turn the blow aside far enough. Though at that point your sword is basically wedged <em>between</em> both of you and it’s kind of unclear whether that counts, and while you’re trying to work that out, you both bop each other a few times for good measure and eventually end up just laughing at whatever’s going on. Dad gives up and declares it a 2-2 tie.

    “Heh, I’ve been working hard for it!” That’s Seth. He’s not as humble as you. Wait, is that thought not humble? This is the problem with thinking about it! “But you really got me with that jump. I mean, how high can you go?”

    “I bet I can jump over you.”

    “No way.”

    You give it a try. A few tries, in fact, though you make Seth stand off to the side instead of kicking him in the face when you fail. Which was definitely a good decision, since you would have done exactly that twice before managing to barely clear his height on the third attempt. “Way.”

    “Wow. You weren’t kidding when you said ‘perfect Body.’ Really, no magic in that jump?”

    “I still look normal, right? So I couldn’t have, with the disguise still going.”

    “Well, ‘normal...’”

    “What? Did I miss something?”

    “No! It’s just there’s no way your ‘normal’ self could have done any of that!” He smiles more calmly this time. “It’s just really nice to see you so healthy and confident.”

    You’re not prepared for that level of sincerity. “... Yeah. It’s... good.” You look away, returning to your standard awkwardness. “Last time I was here...” A pause; you don’t know what to say about it, so you don’t. “Er, nevermind. But this time, everything feels normal again. I’m glad I came back.”

    “Heh. Yeah, you didn’t cry this time.”

    <em>Scene 106</em>
    “... That was kind. I’m glad you’re not the kind of person to hit someone when they’re down.”

    He looks back, seemingly confused. “Well, yeah. I’m not gonna try to kill my sister in a sparring match.”

    Seth doesn’t seem to get it, but you don’t feel like pressing the issue. In fact, you’re faintly embarrassed you brought it up at all. Still, it’s good to know he hasn’t changed.

    ...

    You spend more time out and about in the afternoon, being shown various changes to the area since you left and even visiting the church again. Father Turner is apparently out-

    “Wait, why? Aren’t priests supposed to be at their churches for holidays?”

    “Of course, Ms Goodall,” the deacon says, showing an uncommon amount of deference to you. Of course, he knows you’re an Angel since he was there for your Ascension. Despite yourself, it feels kind of good; he was always a little smug. “Father Turner is at the Cathedra today as he is participating in a bishop selection interview.”

    “Sorry, he’s <em>what?”</em>

    “My apologies; perhaps I misspoke. Father Turner is being interviewed at the Cathedra today, as he is a candidate to become a bishop.”

    “A - a bishop? Already?” You quickly count it up; Father Turner couldn’t have been a priest for more than five or six years by now. To be a bishop candidate already... wait. “This - does this have anything to do with him Ascending two Angels in a row?”

    “I’m afraid I do not know. The details of his candidacy are, of course, confidential.”

    “Right. Of course.” You’d bet quite a lot that you’re right, though. Bishops this young aren’t unheard of - and he had been a deacon for a while before becoming a full priest - but it’s still a rare event to even be considered at this stage in his career. “Well, if I don’t see him on the way back, please give him my congratulations.”

    “Of course.”

    Of course.

You’re feeling lethargic and out of sorts, and you don’t think it’s the weather. Despite the harsh sun and high temperature, your Body is able to cope. Similarly, you don’t think it’s the activities or your family. You’ve spent an awful lot of time training your Mind lately and you simply can’t buy that you wouldn’t figure it out if you were just sad normally. No, you’re pretty sure you know what’s wrong.

    You’re nearly burnt out of Soul energy. You’ve been keeping that disguise up all day, which is a new spell you’re not used to maintaining for so long. You can feel the telltale emotional numbness and lack of motivation spreading through your other aspects, driving your bad mood. And everything was going so well!

    Still, at least you caught it before you lost your disguise entirely. Trying to keep the specifics (and particularly the concerning name of the condition) away from your family, you return home and gratefully return to your true Angelic form, allowing your Soul to recover from the constant exertion. Seth still seems put out that you don’t have wings. You tell him again that only Archangels have permanent wings, and you don’t know enough Body transmutation to grant yourself even temporary ones. He figures you should have it sorted out in another year. You tell him he’s dreaming.

    ... You’re not recovering as fast as you’d like. You stick around for dinner and are still there well into evening, when you had tentatively planned to be <em>back</em> already. You are regaining some energy, just more slowly than normal. Do you have enough to maintain the disguise all the way back? How long should you stay to be sure? How long after dark are you allowed to be out? When is the last train tonight? If only you had some means of contacting your friends, but long-distance telepathy is so far out of your reach it makes wings seem reasonable.

You still feel tired, but have you recovered enough? It’s just not possible to tell without some frame of reference, and you’re simply not practiced enough with magic and Soul exhaustion to know how much is enough. Thankfully, tomorrow is Sulday and you won’t miss anything no matter what happens, but you have a sneaking suspicion that staying the night outside the Cathedra without <em>telling</em> anyone would be a huge problem. Someone would probably report you missing and it’d be a whole big deal. Angels can’t just disappear.

    So. You need to go back. There’s not really any option other than just picking a time and going as quickly as you can; the only real question is how long to wait. Now? Another hour? The last train? Are you overreacting? Come on; you were able to wander around disguised all day! Surely you’ve recovered enough energy by now to handle the less-than-an-hour trip back to the Cathedra.

    “...” Come to think of it, are you <em>really</em> this much of a wimp? You know that Soul exhaustion isn’t particularly dangerous, and you’ve been resting for several hours. There’s almost no way you don’t have enough energy to go back right now. So...

    C’mon, you can’t be <em>that</em> paranoi-

    You switch to Mind and send a flash of energy through yourself, purging your thoughts of external influences.

    And you-

    You were <em>right.</em>

    You don’t feel nearly as tired. You don’t feel nearly as scared to leave. Your thoughts are your own again, and that fear you just purged is replaced with one born of an entirely different source. Something was influencing your Mind. Something wanted you to stay.

    <em>What is it?</em>

    And, perhaps more urgently, <em>what do you do about it?!</em>

A rogue Angel, like the betrayer, trying to manipulate you.

    What the <em>hell</em> do you do?

    <em>Scene 107</em>
    Okay, stay calm and think about this rationally. It’s hard, with all that extra energy bouncing around your Mind, but you don’t dare release the spell until you’ve thought through a plan. Whatever was influencing you could do it again as soon as you let go of the magic. You need to leave. But what should you tell your family?

    ... Your mysterious adversary wants you to stay, so obviously you should do the opposite of that. And clearly if it wants you to <em>stay</em>, then it’s not after your parents or Seth. And even if it were, it’s definitely not concerned about you being there to defend them. So either it’s just after you specifically (most likely, you think) or it’s after everyone and you won’t be able to make a difference even if you stay to try to protect them. Or, you suppose, you could bring them with you, but that could cause even more problems if your adversary catches up along the way. What would the betrayer Angel think about witnesses now? And the corruption?

    Yeah.

    So it seems safest for your family to stay put, and that means you just need to not worry them. As much as you don’t want to lie, sometimes that’s just the best option. Ah, but Seth will see right through you if you try to lie to him directly, so maybe...

    “I’m feeling strong enough, so I’ll head back now. I had a good time; I’ll write you soon.”

    “You’re speaking all weird. Are you really okay to leave?”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1238667709034663958 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1238667709034663958><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, May 10, 2024 9:43 PM">9:43 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“It’s just a side effect of all the magic I used. I’ll be better in the morning.” You are, of course, lying, but hopefully your intonation is unusual enough Seth can’t tell. You’ve remained attuned to Mind and cast that emotional suppression spell you were thinking about earlier. It’s not very precise, so using it tends to deaden most of your emotions, not just the ones you were targeting. Except in this case, that’s exactly what you want. You feel dead inside, but crucially, you don’t feel like yourself and the usual tells that indicate you’re lying aren’t there.

    You hope.

    “Hmm... okay...” Seth doesn’t seem entirely convinced, but at least he’s not challenging you on it. “And you remember how to get back to the station in the dark?”

    “Perfect Mind,” you say, tapping your temple. “I know the way back.”

    A shrug. “Okay. See you next year. Or sooner?”

    “When I can. Hopefully soon.”

    You hug everyone again and say your final farewells, then step outside into the night. It’s very dark, but that doesn’t really bother you right now. Nor does the fact that something dangerous is still out there. You’ve just got to get back to the station and it’ll be too public for anything to happen.

    Okay, this is really messing with your head. You should change back.

    With a breath out, you release the suppression spell and switch back to the one that guards your Mind against interference. Your emotions return in an instant, causing your breath to hitch as you remember you’re already scared of the dark from all your nightmares and now the knowledge that there <em>definitely is</em> something out there makes it all the worse.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1238667770145673296 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1238667770145673296><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, May 10, 2024 9:43 PM">9:43 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Another big problem is your appearance. You’d have to switch back to Body in order to recover your disguise, but that would leave your Mind vulnerable. After thinking about it for a few minutes inside, you eventually decided to risk being seen as an Angel (it’s dark and there aren’t many people around) rather than risk losing control of your decisions. One could lead to a minor scandal and a firm talking-to; the other could lead to death. Yeah, you know which risk sounds more appealing.

    So off you go through the darkened streets, balancing a desire to stay in the light of the few streetlamps around with a desire to hide away from them. You’re already jogging, uneasily passing through empty intersections as quickly as you dare. What are you going to say if you run into someone? Will you pretend to be on a mission? Surely they wouldn’t believe it; no one would send a trainee like yourself out at night with no backup. Just... do your best to avoid getting into a situation like that. The station’s not far off, really, and it should be faster at your current pace. As long as you don’t miss a turn. It’s hard to read the signs in the dark. You’re still going the right way. Probably.

    Someone peeks at you from a lit window as you hurry past. Surely they didn’t get a good enough glimpse to tell anything. You speed up, back itching as if something’s about to stab you in it. A glance behind you; still nothing there. You’re not reassured.

    Warm lights up ahead; a train’s bell clangs. The station is close and that light is the square in front of it. Even at this hour, it’ll still be busy with people. You’ve got to change back to your disguise now; there’s just no way you can ride a regular train all the way back as an Angel. It’ll be far too obvious.

Unlike in two crisis situations before - both involving Naoriel, now that you think about it - there’s no sudden surge of warmth and no instant aspect switch. You’re on your own this time, and you have to just stand there for many excruciating seconds as you try to wrangle your Soul into the right phase. It’s made harder by your fear, which you <em>know</em> you could fix if you returned to Mind, but that’d just put you right back where you were! You have to just power through and <em>make it work!</em>

    You make the switch, finally, your Soul slotting into place with almost a jolt. Now you just have to cast the spell - not a quick or easy feat on its own - and you’ll at last be able to emerge into safety.

    There’s a man walking quickly down the street in your direction. He’s heading for the station... or you. Head up, but eyes in shadow from the darkness and a large cap, like some factory workers tend to wear. Your attunement to Body tells you his movements are somewhat unnatural, like that girl from earlier. The night is cold, yet he’s only wearing thin clothes appropriate for an evening at home. And a pair of incongruously thick worker’s gloves?

    What do you do?

    <em>Scene 108</em>
    No. Stay calm. You’re probably just being influenced by Mind magic to find this man more threatening than he actually is. Just step off to the side here where you’ll be in deeper shadow, then finish the spell. Easy.

    The man glances at you on his way past. “Huh?” He looks back, but you’ve finished your disguise in the second between glances. “Must’ve been imagining it,” he mutters. Then, in a louder voice intended for you to hear, “Evenin’, lil’ miss.” He shakes his head as he wanders off, obviously confused.

    Too close. You pass the man again on your way into the station, though neither of you say anything that time. Get your tickets from the counter and make your way to the proper platform to await the train. Even later at night, service is still frequent today due to the holiday; you won’t have long to wait.

    ... There sure are a lot of people around like that man. Weird gait, though probably undetectable to someone not attuned to Body. Weirdly underdressed for the weather, though with thick work gloves. Do they all work at the same factory and are just getting done at the same time? Was there a convention for glove appreciators? You wander down to the other end of the platform, trying to look casual doing it. Some of the glove people follow you, though it’s hard to tell why and you wouldn’t have noticed if you weren’t actively monitoring them. Maybe they just think you know where the train will show up.

    Well, none of them approach, harass, or attack you, so you suppose it’s fine. Just a little weird.

    At last, the train arrives three minutes late and you board to return downtown. Some of the glove people get on, but some of them just wander off. The doors close and you let out a relieved breath, starting to believe you’ve gotten away from whatever might have been chasing you. Or, really, it might <em>not</em> have been and you were just psyching yourself out for no reason at all.

Everyone else on board seems normal. Plus, you’ve got a seat to yourself this time so you don’t have to deal with anyone making the day’s heat even worse.

    ... Why did you think it was cold earlier? The day was blazingly hot and the night is still warmer than normal. Maybe it was just panic. You’re not entirely convinced, but don’t have a better explanation.

    Now, with the immediate situation under control, your thoughts (almost certainly your own again, given how far you’ve traveled) turn to what you should do after returning to the Cathedra. Admittedly, you don’t have any <em>real</em> evidence that anything dangerous was going on. Nothing actively attacked you and there was nothing weird going on - at least, nothing that you couldn’t explain in some other way. Like a glove-wearer’s convention. Well, the factory explanation is probably more sensible, but you get the idea.

    If you tell someone and they send a real Angel to investigate, what are they going to find? Probably nothing, if you’re being honest. You’d just be wasting important peoples’ time and making yourself look more paranoid to the dispatchers who you <em>really</em> don’t want to stop believing your reports. But of course, if you don’t tell anyone and there is an actual thing there, you could be making the situation worse by letting whatever it is get away with whatever it’s doing.

What <em>was</em> it? What was it doing? Why did it want you to stay? Was... was that even magic at all or was it just a different part of your own Mind and you’re going nuts? Were you just misleading yourself unconsciously, wanting to stay behind now that home felt so much more comfortable? Can that even happen? It seems ridiculous, but you know that magic is imposing your will on the world through your Soul. There’s enough wiggle room there for the idea of unconscious self-delusion through magic to seem <em>possible</em>, if not <em>plausible.</em>

    Here you are. Push your way onto the platform, through the still-busy downtown core, and onto the somewhat quieter streets back to the Cathedra. Everything here is wider and more well-lit, in contrast to the dim, narrow alleys near your parents’ house.

    The gate guards don’t say anything unusual about your late return - it’s still within the same day, so you’re fine - and you release your disguise with a grateful sigh as you pass into the grounds proper. It’s surprising just how much better it feels to look like an Angel. You’d swear there was a physical difference, even though you know there isn’t really; it’s all just an illusion. Now, transmutation...

    Okay, Hearth Hall is that way. But the Center is the other way, and if you want to report what happened to someone, sooner is probably better than later...

    <em>Scene 109</em>
    ... You’re not confident enough to actually go report anything properly. What would you say? That you feel like something was influencing you to stay too long and that you saw too many people wearing gloves? No, if you’re going to say anything, you should at least have some better information first. So you head back to Hearth Hall and ask around. Other people were out in the city today, presumably. Maybe you’re not the only one who encountered something like this?

    None of your friends were in the same district today, and no one noticed anything particularly weird elsewhere. Which means you’re going crazy, it was a very localized phenomenon, or it was a Soul thing that you’re just better at sensing than anyone else. Yara and Serri ask several followup questions about if you’re okay and what happened specifically, so you have to kind of lamely explain that you’re perfectly fine, nothing really happened, and you’re starting to doubt if there was ever anything there at all. The surge of lucidity when you purged your Mind felt so real at the time, but now... you’re starting to wonder.

    Naoriel is curious about your guess that it could have been a rogue Angel - the two of you are still hunting for information on who the betrayer might be, after all - but it was really only a guess. At least the last update you got from her father suggested that he had a good lead on who it might be, though he wasn’t sure yet and needed to gather more information. Still, even if he figures it out, the challenge of actually apprehending them without them giving away the secret is... significant. But there’s nothing you can do about it now.

    Even Erich kind of surprises you with his response: “I believe you.”

    “Wai - what? You... believe I <em>think</em> I sensed something, right?”

If you sensed something, there was something to sense.”

    Huh? Of course, some of your other friends had claimed to believe you as well, but not as directly - and this is <em>Erich!</em> He doesn’t like you, right? “W-well, er, good. Th-thanks.”

    “Mm hm. Now, what was it? Angel or corruption?”

    “Er, I don’t know-”

    “You do. Even if you never attuned to Soul, there would have been a signature to the magic that affected you. A color to the manifested Soul. You know what it feels like to have an Angel cast magic upon you, so did it feel like that?”

    “Erm...” It was so brief and such a light touch. “S-sorry. I just... I can’t be sure.”

    He sighs and stands up. “May I have your permission?”

    “Er - permission for what?”

    “Mind magic. For comparison purposes.”

    “...” You’re surprisingly nervous about the idea, but even though you’re not exactly <em>friends</em>, it’s not like Erich would try to hurt you. He’s not <em>bad</em>. “Okay...”

    “Here, then.”

    A sense of pleasant warmth - you aren’t attuned to anything in particular, so you’re feeling his Soul as it weaves his magic - followed by a sudden desire to sit down and stay put. Since you’re expecting it this time and it’s less in tune with your actual thoughts, you’re able to resist the magic fairly well. The sensation isn’t much at all like - actually... “Can you hold that for a few seconds?” you ask, starting to switch phases. “Let me try a purge.”

    “Certainly.”

    A flash of energy flushes your Mind of external influences. Erich ends his spell a moment later, looking at you questioningly.

    “I - it didn’t feel like that, no. But... I don’t know if it was just more subtle, or - look, I don’t know what an Archangel is capable of, or the corruption, really. I just don’t want to rule anything out when I don’t know for sure!”

You think it could have been - ah, from the incident at the wall in March?”

    “Y-yes. But I don’t know why someone like that would do anything like this.”

    “And it’s obvious why the corruption would,” he completes. “A young Angel versus a shade? Easy pickings, if it could get you to stay put.”

    A shiver. “A shade? Really? In the middle of the city?”

    “Mindless darkness can’t use magic.”

    “...”

    “I don’t think you should keep this one to yourself, Jessamine. You could be in danger the next time you leave.”

    “... I was kind of planning to ask Clarity to go look, since I didn’t want to bother an actual dispatcher.”

    “Very well. She’s strong with Body, which could be helpful detecting the strange movements you described.”

    “... Yeah. I might, er, go find her now. It’s probably not too late.”

    “Alright. Good luck.”

    “... Thanks.”

    So, yeah, that was weird. But now that you think about it, he has been doing this kind of thing more often lately. Volunteering for your experiment, helping you learn the disguise spell; even before then, he’s only really been annoying when you’re competing. Even when it’s not really a competition, like in the basic magic course.

    Well, time to find Clarity. Although it is pretty dark and you don’t know where she is; she could even be on a mission right now. Maybe you should wait till tomorrow.

    <em>Scene 110</em>
    ... No, you’ll go now. The longer you wait, the more stale your information will be. It’s already been a few hours; it’s definitely plausible that whatever it was is long gone by now, if it ever existed in the first place.

    Luckily, one of the adult Angels currently hanging around Hearth Hall is one of Clarity’s friends and knows where she is. It doesn’t take long to get to Forger Hall from there, but it’s well dark at this time of evening and even with the path’s lights, the misty emptiness around you feels foreboding. At least there are still a few people out: Angels and monks returning from late-running research or heading to the Center. You’d feel much more uneasy if you were alone.

    Unluckily, Forger Hall is dark and empty. The main doors are still unlocked, but you sort of wonder if that was just a mistake as you creep into the foyer and turn on your glow to help see. It doesn’t help that this is the oldest of the halls and the wood flooring is creaky with age. Combine that with the relatively cooler evening compared to the blazing-hot day and you have a very talkative building. You try your best to not jump at any of the settling noises and hurry along to the lab where you will (ostensibly) find Clarity.

    And find her you do. There’s a steady mechanical lamp glowing through the door’s window as you approach, and you can spot a familiar head of red hair as you peek through just to be sure. A knock and a “hm? Come in!” later, you’ve carefully eased the door open to-

    “AGH! Wh-what is - oh.” You press a hand against your chest, trying to shove your heart back into line. “Th-that was, uhm, unexpected.”

    Clarity has the gall to laugh, though at least only briefly. “Sorry, sorry. At least it’s not a person, right!”

    “That’s what I thought at first!”

Similarly upsetting grates in the floor let you know that the procedures carried out here aren’t always blood-free. And, yes, you know it would be nuts to see Clarity here with a human corpse, but... well, that’s just the kind of night you’re having. The pig corpse is startling enough.

    “S-so, er, what’s that... for?” you ask, trying and failing to not look at it. There are a number of scars and cuts on the poor thing’s skin, many very fresh.

    Clarity sets down the huge knife you hadn’t noticed her carrying until now, making you jump again. God, she’s wearing a butcher’s apron too! The pig just kind of stole the spotlight, you suppose. “Practicing. My first wasteland duty is coming up before the end of the year, so I need to make sure my healing’s as good as it can be. Obviously, practicing on real people isn’t a good idea, so I’ve got this little piggy here to help. Isn’t he friendly?”

    You look at the pig. The pig does not look at you, as it is dead. “Er... sure...”

    “There’s a lot of similarities between people and pigs, you know,” she says, absently picking up the knife again. You take several steps back, nervous despite your knowledge that she definitely, absolutely, 100% will not stab you. At least, not on purpose. Probably. “A lot of the muscles and internal structure are about the same, so it’s not as big a difference as you’d expect. See, if I do this here-”

    She turns quickly and slits the pig’s throat with enough force to nearly tear its head off. No blood leaks out. You feel sick watching its snout bob like that.

    “-I can practice sealing up a wound like that on a human, without having to hurt anyone! See, just... like this...” A quick gesture and a slow brush across the wound, as if she were wiping away a stain. The cut is gone. “And you can see I’ve repaired the throat, too; it’s not just surface level. Here, take a look!”

    “... No, thanks. I believe you.”

I can.. yeah, I can see - it’s kind of grim in here, isn’t it?”

    A nod.

    “Did you have something you wanted to talk about? I can clean up and meet you outside?”

    “Er, y-yes. Something I saw in the city today.”

    “Hm! Alright, I was about done here anyway. If you want to just wait outside the door I can be right out in a few minutes!”

    You... take her up on that, sitting on the creaky wood floor outside and wondering what your nightmares will be like tonight. You’ve had a very full day for them to take inspiration from. They’ve been better lately, sure, but it’s not like they’ve gone away entirely. Especially if you’re stressed out. Yeah, tonight won’t be fun.

    “Hello!~” Clarity pops out of the lab looking all shiny and clean, with no trace of pig, knife, or apron. You don’t know what she did with them and you try very hard not to care. “Now, what did you want to talk about?”

    “Well, er, when I went home today...”

    You explain the gist of it. The Mind magic; the weird movements, the gloves. Your guesses; Erich’s idea. And what you’d like her to do about it. If possible. If it wouldn’t be too much trouble. Not that you want to impose. And so on.

    “Hmm. I’m not sure if that could be a shade, really. They’re subtle - or at least the ones that get into the city have to be - but I don’t know if they’re <em>that</em> subtle. Plus, the ones that can use magic are really rare; they need to have some remnant of their Soul left from when they were people and the constructed ones can’t do it at all.” A pause; she frowns in thought. “Maybe it’s one of the ones that can manipulate Souls and it granted a human magic?”

    “Shades can do that?!”

No idea how common that is; I imagine it’s even more rare than the other ones I was just talking about.” Another pause; she looks carefully at you. “Jess, you’re pretty sensitive to Soul stuff, right?

    “No, it was real! I know it.” You’re surprised at your own conviction; Erich’s acceptance may have given you a bit more confidence than you’re used to.

    “... Okay, maybe it was - hum, but Mindless darkness can’t use magic...” A shrug. “Well, I don’t Mind going out to look for you, if you really don’t want to tell a dispatcher, but can it wait till tomorrow? I’ve already had a mission today and I was looking forward to some sleep.”

    <em>Scene 111</em>
    It’s very difficult to impose, but with everything that’s happened today... it’s possible. “Er, w-would you... go now, if you can? It’s just that it’s already been a while and whatever it was might be long gone by tomorrow...”

    “...” She eyes you for a few uncomfortably long seconds before grinning and patting you on the shoulder. “Look at you, Jess! That was almost a forceful request!”

    “I, er, sorry...”

    A laugh. “No, no, it’s good to be assertive! But you’re totally gonna owe me one for this, alright? Next time I need someone to go out at night, I’m gonna call you.”

    “That’s... fair. Okay.”

    “Alright, you said how many streets over from the station, again?”

    You give Clarity the directions in more detail again and off she goes. Belatedly, you wonder how long she’ll be able to stay out and how she’ll get back if she misses the last train in about two hours. Despite her prowess in Body transmutation, you’re pretty sure she still can’t fly.

    Well, she’s an experienced full Angel; you’re sure she knows how to handle this. And you definitely aren’t just thinking that to suppress your worry that something might happen to her and it’d be all your fault.

    ...

    You find yourself wandering the streets near your home at night. Jolt into alertness, startled and baffled why you aren’t in bed. The answer comes, obvious in only a few seconds. This is a dream. There’s no way you could have just blacked out and gotten all the way back here.

    It’s very realistic, though. You take a few cautious steps, feeling cool, slick cobbles beneath your feet. You aren’t dressed to go out either; you’re in your nightclothes. Is that what you would be wearing if this were a dream? What if you’ve been kidnapped? No, that doesn’t make <em>any</em> sense. Calm down; just wake up.

    “...”

    Yeah, you don’t know how to do that.

All of the streetlamps are off. You tap one nearby, as if you could maybe diagnose why it isn’t working, but the chill metal provides no clues. None of the street names are recognizable, though the layout seems just close enough to look familiar.

    There’s a distant clatter. You freeze, listening to see if it repeats.

    Yes. Over that way. Then, a voice. The words are eaten by the distance, but you can tell even from here that it’s Clarity speaking. Without more than a second to consider, you hurry off into the warren in search of her.

    As you get closer, you can start to make out some words, though most still dissolve into indistinguishable mumbles even though you should be able to understand them at this volume. “Be at peace.” “Let her go.” “There’s nothing for you here.” That sort of thing. What is she doing?

    Movement ahead. You stop and press yourself into a convenient darkened doorway, shutting off your glow on instinct. A limping woman with a disconcerting expression of horror and exhaustion shuffles past. Away from where you’re headed. She’s leading a young boy by the hand; he’s shaking and utterly quiet. You almost reach out to help them, but stop yourself. You don’t know what’s going on, but you’re certain there’s some sort of danger. Revealing your presence too soon might not be a good idea.

    Several more similarly disheveled and terrified people pass by as you continue creeping closer. You have to leave your glow off at this point, worried that someone will spot it if you don’t. You can’t hear Clarity from ahead anymore; just a low, gloopy bubbling noise like someone left a thick stew on the stove for too long.

    Suddenly, here you are. The street opens up into a wider square, illuminated only by the fitful flickerings of an Angelic glow... but not yours.

Hands on legs, back straight, perfectly calm.

    Head and upper Body engulfed by some horrible, amorphous, tar-like monstrosity dribbling from the fountain’s spouts.

    W-wh-what do you do? What <em>can</em> you do? You don’t have a weapon, or enough training, or even much idea what’s going on! That thing is (presumably) eating (presumably) Clarity, but... but what can you do?! This is a dream, you’re pretty sure, but... what if it isn’t? Or what if it is, but it reflects reality? You just sent her out to go exactly here and look for exactly this! What-

    A humanoid figure, made of fuzzy shadow with two silver eyes, steps out of the darkness just a dozen feet in front of you. It regards you with an unreadable expression, its Body near-invisible in the dark.

    The shade from your previous dream. You’re frozen again, its presence locking you to the spot just like before. The tar monstrosity continues glooping its way down the kneeling Angel; almost to their waist. The shade tilts its head, as if confused or considering something.

    Mind magic. Last time, you freed yourself with Mind magic. Probably; maybe? The details are fuzzy and you’re a little too preoccupied to recall them perfectly. But you’re not some helpless nobody anymore. You’ve improved a lot in the last year, and even though you’re still terrified, the idea that this is simply too implausible to <em>not</em> be a dream helps blunt the edge of that panic.

    You focus on Mind. Your Soul begins to shift. The shade changes position slightly. The tar monster is down to the Angel’s forearms.

    What do you do?

    <em>Scene 112</em>
    You switch to Mind and everything moves very quickly for a moment. A burst of energy in your head; a flurry of movement from the shade. You run forward as it leaps at you, the same as before, except this time you throw yourself to the ground to avoid its lunge <em>on purpose</em> instead of because you fell off the bed. After scrambling to your feet again, already shifting to Body as you go, a quick glance behind confirms the thing is gone. Where? It did this last time too, but then you woke up right away. Is it actually gone or just hiding somewh - stop that; you have to hurry!

    The Angel’s glow vanishes beneath the tar and you spend a moment to release your own so you can see. With Body as your aspect, you need a physical connection to work magic. Therefore, though you’re both grossed out and very concerned about what the thing will do to you if you touch it, you have no choice. Hands in the gloop. Connected.

    It’s disgustingly warm and so viscous you can barely make a dent in it with your fingers. The muck’s overpowering scent burns your nose, but you can’t quite describe what it smells like. Like burning-freezing cold, maybe. Even though it <em>feels</em> warm. And it hurts. A dull ache in the skin of your palms that you’re certain will quickly grow worse if you stay like this.

    Your plan is very simple. Angels possess the power to burn away and purify corruption with a touch, and this tar can be nothing else but corruption. You hold no illusions that you’ll be able to destroy this entire mass on your own, but you don’t need to. You’re going to burn your way through to the trapped Angel, pull them out, and then improvise from there.

There’s no fancy twist of weird state of Mind; it’s just a straightforward contest of its power against yours. The most you have to do here is just contain your Soul as it rushes through your hands to burn away the tar so that you don’t get carried away and kill yourself by exhausting all your energy trying to destroy the entire monster. Which, admittedly, is a little tough. Your power <em>wants</em> to destroy the corruption. That’s what your Soul is <em>made for</em>. But you hold it back, mostly, channeling your energy just into the small area around your hands.

    Goop melts away and steams into the air. The smell grows unbearable; you almost gag at the indescribably vile stench. Heating this thing up only made it worse. But you can see something white and glowing just beneath your hands; only a little bit more and... something hard. You grab on, brace yourself against the fountain - ack; little tendrils of tar were trying to wrap around your feet! - and <em>pull!</em> Enhance your Body as you do, pulling your Soul back in to empower yourself instead of destroying the goop.

    There’s a sickening squelch, another burst of horrid scent, and you fall back against the fountain holding a dripping, tar-covered skull.

    “--!!!”

    The skull bounces merrily across the cobbles as you instinctively throw it away. The skin on your hands is burning and the tar has re-absorbed the rest of the Angel’s now headless Body. Your back itches; there’s tar on it and your legs now, too. You tear yourself away from the fountain and run halfway across the square before collapsing to your hands and knees, gasping for air and desperately trying not to look at the skull. It’s not a clean, white abstraction like you’ve seen in anatomy courses. It’s... you gag again, about ready to throw up.

    you can’t

    a a a aA A A

    ...

    You wake up with a choking gasp. Tar lies around you, scorched and burned by incredible heat. Your Body is healed, completely, without a single scratch or burn anywhere. It takes you a moment to figure out what happened.

    You died.

    This is your second chance. The first time in your life that you would die, God will save you. You revise the tense from future to past. God saved you. But, if that’s true for you, then the skull-

    “No...” Still dead; just more horribly melted now. You quickly look away. Maybe they already used it, or the goop triggered it earlier, or it doesn’t work on just a skull, or... you don’t know. You failed. There’s nothing more you can do here; you just have to-

    The clatter of a loose stone just behind.

    You turn.

    The shade stabs you in the chest, right below the heart.

    No. Nononono not like this.

    The magic that would save you hovers tauntingly just out of your grasp. You’ve never trained extensively with healing spells, nor can you focus through the agonizing, leaking emptiness as blood pours out of the ragged wound even if you had. There’s nothing you can do but take a few stumbling steps, trip, and collapse to the ground again.

    Angels may be God’s perfect soldiers, but you’re certainly just as fragile as any mortal human. You know that now.

    ...

    Bright sunlight. You open your eyes and slowly sit up.

    You’re in your bedroom at the Cathedra. It’s morning. You aren’t dead.

    “...”

    Well. You knew your nightmares were going to be bad. But that was beyond even your expectations.

    <em>Scene 113</em>
    Well... better to be sure. You hurry downstairs, about ready to start checking with everyone you run into (at least, everyone you know). But that seems to be unnecessary, since you can already hear her explaining something with great enthusiasm. But of course, the last time you heard her...

    You find Clarity in the little cafe area on the first floor, cheerfully chatting with Yara. “You’re okay!” you exclaim, accidentally interrupting her.

    “Oh, morning, Jess! And I thought <em>I</em> wanted to sleep in after all that.”

    “Y-you... you are okay, right? No, erm, shades or... t-tar monsters?”

    “Tar monsters?”

    “...” With a careful effort, you manage to avoid breaking down at the table. The skull didn’t look <em>that</em> much like her, anyway. You’re fine. “I... had a dream... You were... you, um... died.” A pause. “And I did too.” Another pause. “Twice.”

    “Goodness, that sounds-”

    Clarity laughs, ruffling your hair as if you were a little kid. “Ah, you must have been really worried about me, huh?”

    “I... guess, yeah.”

    “Well, want to hear what I actually found, then? Put your Mind at ease?”

    “You actually found something?”

    “Can you spare her the theatrics this time?” Yara asks. “I quite enjoyed them, but something tells me Jessamine would appreciate a more sincere summary.”

    “Aw, really?”

    You nod rapidly, sitting down next to Yara. He stands up, saying “I’ll get you some breakfast, alright? I’ve already heard this one.”

    “Okay, the boring version?” Clarity confirms. “Right. So I didn’t see any big group of gloved people around the station or nearby, but one of the ticket agents had. She saw you, too, actually; apparently you were pretty noticeable wandering around by yourself at night like that.”

    “I... guess there wouldn’t be a lot of young people on their own...”

    “But anyway, I wandered around for a bit looking for anyone walking weird, like you said, and I did actually find one guy.”

Was he wearing gloves?” You’re not sure why you’re so fixated on the handwear, to be honest.

    “Yep! And seemed kinda out of it, so I tailed him for a bit. I didn’t sense any corruption on the guy himself, but when he got home, I noticed a burned building just down the block. So I went and checked, and sure enough, some lost Souls were still hanging around there.”

    “O-oh.” Lost Souls are still kind of an unexplained phenomenon; you learned about them in Brother Trigg’s history class. Usually, a Soul will dissipate shortly after the Body or Mind it’s tied to dies, presumably dying as well. (Although no one really knows where Souls go after that, if they go anywhere at all. The church’s public stance is that God reclaims the energy of dissipated Souls and may eventually return them to new lives with faint memories of the people they had been - though as an Angel, you know that’s never actually been proven. You hope it’s true.)

    But some Souls just... don’t. Most lost Souls are formed by lingering on after a particularly miserable or violent death, and they sometimes seem able to bind themselves to other objects or Bodies different from their original one. They’re one of the many facets of corruption that Angels must destroy within the city, since there’s no way to put them back together after their original Body’s death. It’s one of the few exceptions to the “human Souls are sacred” clause, since they’re corrupted beyond any chance of repair - you’re told it’s kinder to end their suffering. No one, save God, can reverse death. Not even an Angel wielding His power.

    “So I destroyed them. They seemed really weak and confused; it wasn’t much of a fight, really. And then I Blessed that guy and a few other people I saw around, since it seemed like maybe they were being influenced by those Souls? He seemed a lot more together after that and was kind of surprised how he got there. Apparently the last week or so was a blur.”

It was just the... the Souls?”

    Yara comes back around now with a flaky cinnamon pastry you’ve been really enjoying lately. It’s your guilty pleasure, but today you don’t Mind the guilt; you take it gratefully. “Perfect timing, hm?” he asks, sliding back into a seat. “Although I was cheating a little; I could still hear you over there. The room is quite small. Anyway, the Souls...”

    “That’s the question, isn’t it?” Clarity declares. “It sure seems like that’s it: you found a nest of the things and everything should be fine now that they’re gone! Good for you!”

    “But,” Yara notes. “Lost Souls can’t use magic either. They can potentially manipulate one’s Mind by binding themselves to one’s Body - and thus influencing the Mind like a normal Soul - but it would be completely unheard of to try that on an Angel. And with your Soul sensitivity, I’m certain you would have noticed being possessed.”

    You think back. Your emotions had been twisted and your sensations altered, but... surely, <em>surely,</em> you would have noticed an entire second Soul trying to bind to your Body. Right? “I don’t think a lost Soul got near me,” you agree. “I would have sensed it.” Even though you weren’t attuned to Soul so you couldn’t have <em>seen</em> it, you’re still sure you would have noticed.

    “But who knows what the presence of those other affected people could have done?” Clarity points out. “Corruption close to you can have weird effects, and you might not have sensed it as <em>corruption</em> because it was so weak. I didn’t, after all! Maybe it was bending your Mind to try and get you to stay and be corrupted, even though your resistance is probably too strong for that to work!”

It’s certainly a more likely explanation than a shade and a tar monster influencing you through your dreams.

    Yara shrugs. “For what it’s worth, I don’t think this is a <em>bad</em> explanation. Lost Souls are strange, and they’re difficult to learn more about. It seems plausible to me, even though there are still some questions.”

    “... Okay. I guess it could make sense.”

    “Yep!” You still don’t know where she gets all her energy from. “So don’t worry about it too much, okay? If anything else comes up, we’ll get that too.”

    You hang around with the two of them for the next quarter-hour or so, after which Clarity has to go for some meeting about a wasteland containment plan for a leak near the river. Being a full Angel sounds complicated. And busy.

    “Now, about that dream...” Yara prompts, leaning on the table. “It sounded pretty bad; are you actually feeling fine? Anything you’d like to share about it?”

    A blink. You’ve told Yara about some of your nightmares, so it wouldn’t be the first time to explain being murdered in excruciating detail. But it is rare for them to be this realistic, and for you to be lucid. “I saw the shade again. It was the same one as before, with the silver eyes.”

    “Did it seem to recognize you?”

    “... I don’t know. It didn’t attack until right at the end, at least. But it was so fast, and right after I... melted...” A shiver. “I really hope it’s just a bad dream.”

    “... Jessamine, do you ever wonder why shades look like they do?”

    “I... no, not really?” you admit, considering it. “They’re reflections of humans, right? So it would make sense for them to look like shadows. They’re mirrors of our darkness.”

    “Mindless darkness doesn’t look like shadows at all. You’ve seen it a few times now, in a few different forms. It looks alien. Sometimes dark, but sometimes colorful. It never looks like a human.”

    “But shades are born from human Minds, so-”

    “Not all of them! Remember, some shades gain a Mind through processes we still don’t understand, out in the spawning pools. Only some shades rise from corrupted humans.”

    “...” You glance at him. “It sounds like you have a theory. Care to share?”

It turns out that shades don’t all look the same - though they’re all described as sort of fuzzy shadow people with glowing eyes as their only features, the eyes and body shape are distinct. Plus, their mannerisms are unique as well, meaning it is easily possible to tell which shade you’re dealing with if you’ve encountered it before.”

    “Okay...?”

    “My point is, why silver? It’s a color with a lot of symbolism, right?”

    He’s not wrong. Gold and silver are both associated with divinity, though from different perspectives. Gold is the color of seraphs’ skin and wings, the color of the Emissary’s eyes (he wasn’t born that way!) and the color of Angelic glows for the older and stronger Angels. Silver, on the other hand, is the color of a young Angel’s glow and what the church traditionally decorates their buildings with (as it’s easier to get things that are colored silver than colored gold, you suppose). It’s also how a lot of magic is described by the experienced Angels who can see it; you’re still not sure how <em>that</em> works.

    Gold tends to be seen as warmer, older, and more associated with Soul and God. Silver, conversely tends to be seen as cooler, younger, and more associated with Mind and magic. There is plenty of overlap on both colors, though; you wouldn’t think twice about God being described as silver or your magic being seen as gold.

    “I guess it’s a little strange to see a shade with eyes colored like magic? Maybe?”

    “Does anything else that’s happened to you in, say, the first few months of your training remind you of those colors?”

    “... Your experiment. You turned our Souls gold. Somehow.” You narrow your eyes. “Yara, you agreed to stop Soul transmuting after that. You promised <em>Etalyn!”</em>

    “I did - wait, Etalyn? What does she have to do with-”

You’ll get him one of these days.

    “A-anyway, I haven’t been doing anything dangerous! Or against the rules, since I’m sure you’d ask.”

    He’s right; you would.

    “But the colors don’t seem to be arbitrary. And of the shades that have been documented, my amateur research suggests that the ones with gold and silver eyes tend to be the strongest. Isn’t that interesting; that the ones with colors most closely linked to divinity would have the greatest abilities?”

    “Er... ‘interesting’ is one way to put it, I suppose.”

    “It all seems so closely linked, but I just don’t have anything to tie it together. Why do Angelic Souls turn golden as they age? Does it have something to do with their strength, or is it just age itself? Do shades work the same way? Do their eyes change color as they age? It would be impossible to tell with any certainty given how difficult they are to study. Does that mean the silver and golden-eyed shades are the oldest as well as the strongest?  How did our Souls change color; did I accidentally ‘supercharge’ us with some portion of the energy I put into the system?”

    “So you’re telling me that not only am I haunted by the dream-ghost of a shade, I’m haunted by the dream-ghost of one of the <em>strongest</em> and possibly oldest shades alive?”

    “Hum. You know, it doesn’t sound quite so positive when you put it like that.”

    But you can’t help but giggle, just a little. The image of that horrible melted skull already seems slightly faded; slightly less immediate. You know he’s just trying to distract you in his own silly way. And it’s working, at least a little.

    That’s why it’s so sad that he’s graduating in just over two months. It’s not like he won’t be around anymore, but he’ll have less time. He’ll be busy on missions, meeting other Angels and learning more about the world outside the Cathedra. You’ll still be friends, but...

    <em>Scene 115</em>
    “Hm! Well, sometimes these things happen!”

    You suppose sometimes they do.

    ...

    And now, it’s time. Most of the year has passed in a flash; it is now November 1st, 1225. Six years ago, Yara Ascended to become a trainee Angel. And just this morning, he graduated to become a full one. You went through the whole ritual again like you did for Clarity and Sims, standing around in the Lordstone Cathedral as the Emissary did his thing, and now you’re sitting outside in the misty, chilly morning light as he’s surrounded by a group of ministers and Angels offering congratulations. You and his other closer friends, same as the last two times, sit to the side and wait for the excitement to die down.

    Unfortunately, this time there’s no one in your little group who seems willing to start a conversation. That’s usually Yara’s job, or Clarity’s if she’s here, but he’s obviously busy and she’s away somewhere. Maybe on a mission? In any case, that leaves you, Naoriel, Etalyn, Erich(?), Serri, and Jun (who you haven’t interacted with all that much, but he’s good friends with Serri now). Most of the people on that list are varying degrees of shy and typically wouldn’t start the conversation, and Etalyn seems unusually taciturn today. But... you’re curious why Erich is here and if no one else is going to say anything...

    “H-” Wait wait wait; you cut yourself off quickly. You can’t just ask him what he’s doing here; that’s so rude! Quick, think of a better way to phrase it! Oh no, he’s looking at you now because you started to say something.

    “So, I’ve heard it’s tradition to speculate on the newly graduated Angel’s first mission at this time,” Erich says, glancing at you and looking away in a manner you find hard to interpret. “And yet everyone here is so silent?”

    A breath of relief. Someone else did it. Now you can respond and it’s so much easier than-
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1244334187243241635 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1244334187243241635><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, May 26, 2024 12:59 PM">12:59 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“What are you doing here?” Etalyn grumbles, sitting sideways on a stone bench. “You were never friends with Yara.”

    Ah. G-good? You didn’t have to ask and be the rude one yourself...?

    Erich doesn’t seem to be too perturbed, at least. You know, it’s odd to see him without Denn, actually; you briefly wonder why he’s not here. He was just at the ceremony with everyone else. “Are you an expert on everyone’s interpersonal relationships? One doesn’t have to be constantly with someone to want to wish them well.”

    “The crowd for well-wishers is over there.”

    “And those well-wishers won’t get to say more than a few words to him. I know this may be hard to believe, but I do respect Yara. He has exceptional talent with Soul magic and a strong drive to learn more. Is it too much to ask for just a few minutes to talk to him?”

    “Pah. Believe it when I see it.”

    Okay, you should probably interject now. If only Yara would show up, but he’s too darn popular and still stuck in the crowd! What to say... “I b-bet he’s going to go to the wastelands on his first mission!”

    Everyone looks at you. <em>Oh noooooo-</em> Then, “Really, Jess? A callback to <em>Clarity’s</em> graduation, when she’s not even here?”

    Oh thank God, Naoriel got it <em>and</em> was willing to explain. Yara had been joking about being sent to the wastes because he wouldn’t have to worry about collateral damage, but that was so long ago by now you’re almost surprised anyone remembered at all. “Er, yeah. S-since he likes blowing things up so much, it seems like a good fit.”

    Etalyn rolls her eyes. “The first mission’s about challenging your skills, not sending you to go do something you’re already good at. Everyone knows Yara’s a great blaster, so they’ll send him somewhere all close-quarters.”

    “But he’s good with a sword too, so maybe something in a weird environment? Like the river, or the caves?” That’s Serri, finally speaking up.

    Phew. It was a little awkward, but everyone’s participating now. Erich nods at you in appreciation; you’re again taken aback by the gradual shift in his behavior since you first met him. Is that why Denn isn’t here? Or did he just have something else to do and you’re reading too much into it? With you, it’s almost always the latter, isn’t it?

    A few minutes later, as Jun and Naoriel (with interjections from everyone else) are comparing the merits of the caverns versus the riverbank for a mission setting, the man of the hour finally shows up.

    “Gooood morning, everyone!” Yara exclaims, hopping over the bench to sit down next to Etalyn in a way that you think looks unreasonably stylish. Has he <em>practiced</em> that? “I do hope you’ve been surviving without my presence; I am <em>extremely</em> in-demand today.”

    Etalyn swats him. “Yes, Mr Big Deal.”

    “We’ve just about decided what your first mission will be,” you tell him.

    “Oh? And where shall I be sent?”

    Everyone talks over each other; with your enhanced hearing, you’re pretty sure you caught all the answers and not a single person agreed.

    “Ah, yes, my favorite location: all of them. Good to see nothing’s changed, then!” A blink. “Oh, Erich? I have to say I’m surprised to see you here.”

    “Why? Haven’t we been working together for the past several months?”

    “Well, yes, but I figured you would want to keep that secret. Given that you told me, more than once, that you wanted to keep that secret.”

    “I did, but with you now ready to test it in the field, I believe it’s time to let it go before anyone starts to catch on and get concerned.”

    “Yara,” Etalyn says flatly, interrupting before he can respond. “Have you two been doing any more weird Soul magic? The sort of thing that you <em>promised</em> to stop doing because it would get you hurt or thrown out or executed?”

    “Well, ‘weird’ is a matter of opinion...”

    <em>Scene 116</em>
    “With the overall purpose of the work?”

    “Well, it was originally inspired by our dear Jessamine, of course.”

    “Huh? Me?”

    “Your Soul sensitivity is extremely impressive - and extremely useful, if we can reproduce it,” Erich clarifies. “But you’ve been busy enough on your own over the last few months, so we didn’t want to bother you.”

    “I wasn’t - I could have helped-”

    “And you will, if you so desire, now that we’ve worked out the basic details of it!” Yara exclaims. “You see, there are two main ways we sense Soul: active and passive. Your Soul at its baseline, without being attuned to anything specifically, is able to sense other Souls around it. Everyone here should be familiar with that sort of dim, imprecise sense, yes?”

    Assorted nods. Of course you are, and this is the-

    “This is the sense that is particularly strong for you, Jessamine. At rest, you are able to pick out Soul activity without even trying - sometimes far too much. But the other method, where you actively attune yourself to the Soul aspect and use your physical senses, has limitations as well. You become able to detect Soul with your sight, touch, and faintly hearing and scent, but you’re naturally constrained by the same restrictions on your physical senses. It’s difficult to see Souls through mist, you must be very close in order to feel a touch, and so on. Meanwhile, your passive sense has a much more open range, but is much weaker. With me so far?”

    Etalyn seems to have partially relaxed; it doesn’t seem like Yara was doing anything too dangerous this time around. “You gotta choose between range and precision, and you want both.”

And so we’ve been working on a spell - ideally to become a miracle later - that allows the caster to sort of ‘push out’ their Soul and ‘listen’ to the feedback it receives. It should have the superior range of the passive method, but the added precision of the active method! It’s all projection, of course, so it is limited by the one-target-at-a-time issue, but we’re thinking it would be used more for recon than in combat anyway, so that should be a non-issue.”

    A sigh from Etalyn. “That’s it? You’re not going to suddenly declare that you’ve also added in something else?”

    “That’s it. I’ve been good!”

    “God, Yara, you just had to choose today to bring this up when I’m already so worried about you going out there-” Etalyn cuts herself off, nudging him with her shoulder instead. “Whatever. So, does it work?”

    You and Serri (and Naoriel, who’s been inducted into your little fanclub) glance at each other. That’s the most she’s admitted to caring about him in public for quite some time! One day you’ll get them both!

    “Well, maybe?”

    “What do you mean ‘maybe?’”

    Erich takes over here. “The spell does work. We’ve achieved ranges of about ninety feet so far, beyond which it gets too difficult to pick out the specific resonance you’re listening for among all the background noise. But the hope is that there’s too much interference at the Cathedra - with all the Angels around - for it to make a good testing ground.”

    “And the other hope-” Yara’s hopped back in now. “-is that the corruption sounds very different to an Angelic Soul, so it’ll be a lot easier to hear. Which is why it’s excellent timing that I’ll be heading out today, so I can do some listening and test this method properly!”

    “I, er, hope it goes well,” you say, not really sure what else to bring up. “Maybe it could help control my passive... er, that’s a ‘no,’ then?”

This spell would probably only make you hear <em>more</em> than you already do. Which would certainly be an interesting experiment, but perhaps not until we’ve worked out a few more details first.”

    “Y-yeah...”

    “Why... hasn’t this been tried already?”

    You look over at Jun along with everyone else. He shrinks back a little bit, but Serri pats his arm.

    “Hum?”

    “W-Well, it’s just that if it’s so useful to be able to sense Souls like this, and Angels have been around for a thousand years, surely someone must have tried it already?”

    “You know, it’s a funny thing about history and Angels; back in the early days-”

    “Angels today are stronger than they’ve ever been. That’s how it’s been for centuries,” Erich interrupts. “It seems the longer we’re around - not individually, but as an institution, the more powerful we get. The last mention we found of someone trying something analogous to this was almost two centuries ago, so it’s certainly worth another try now.”

    “I was going to explain that...”

    “And you would have taken ten minutes to do so.”

    That’s more like the Erich you’re used to. Anyway, you were sort of aware of this trend - Trigg mentioned it a few times in your history course - but hadn’t really thought about it in much detail. Now that it’s come up, though...

    “Why? Where does the power come from?” Jun asks.

    “No one knowwssss!” Yara says, waving a spooky hand. “Maybe the magic that older Angels accumulate gets recycled back into new ones when they eventually die, or maybe God is channeling more energy into us as time goes on. Maybe the Cathedra is just getting better at training us, or it could be something else entirely!”

We have a reasonable chance of making something work today that would have been mythical a few centuries ago.”

    You think about that for a while afterwards, long after Yara heads off to the Center and the rest of your group disperses to various destinations. If Angels get their power from God, and Angels are getting stronger over time... then wouldn’t that mean that God is getting weaker?

    It’s a simple equation and you’re able to come up with a few reasons why it wouldn’t be true. Maybe God is also getting stronger, drawing power from some outside source - maybe wherever He came from, if He came from anywhere at all. Maybe it is just improved training or humanity’s Bodies and Souls in general becoming more used to Angelic powers over generations of Ascensions. Maybe you’re draining power from the corruption, shifting the balance in your favor over years and years.

    But what can you say? You’re a pessimist. The simplest explanation is usually the right one. And the idea that God might be growing steadily weaker is a simple (and very frightening) one indeed.

    <em>Scene 117</em>
    It’s very dark and everything is quiet. You shuffle around in bed, trying to ignore whatever vaguely threatening premonition woke you up this time, but it’s no use. You’re wondering about it now, and that anxious curiosity is just waking you up further. With a sigh, you sit up and turn on the - no, better not; you really want to go back to sleep after this. Instead, you just drowsily pad over to the bedroom door (left open again; you’ve mostly gone back to your old habit by now) and head to the window.

    Nothing seems amiss as you peer outside, scanning the silhouettes of various Cathedra structures and the ground far below for anything dangerous or unusual. Mechanical streetlamps shine into the night, illuminating empty pathways and locked-up buildings. Your anxiety starts to settle and you move to close the curtains, already imagining sinking back into bed.

    “...”

    You sure could see pretty far out there.

    The mist is gone.

    You press up against the window, reluctantly admitting that you’re probably not going to be getting any more sleep tonight. It’s not just the mist; the stars and galaxies that everyone always says are above it - those are gone too. Or maybe they never existed; you’ve certainly never seen more than a dim glow to suggest their presence. And... now that you’re looking closer, you can’t see any lights outside of the Cathedra itself. Nucarreo is massive and - even at whatever hour of the night this is - there should be streetlamps or train lights or <em>something</em> visible without all the mist that usually obscures your view. Instead, there’s nothing but empty blackness.

    “...”

With the betrayer’s repeated appearances, the two of you had promised to wake each other up in case anything weird happened overnight. In fact, you even have a spare key for exactly that purpose in case of another silencing or sleeping spell or whatever. So after a few knocks fail to produce any response, you carefully insert the key and step inside, holding your breath against the possibility that...

    Gone. An empty bed, neat and tidy. You search the rest of the room quickly, but there’s no sign of a struggle or... or even a sign that anyone ever lived here. No books, clothes, or other personal artifacts. Would a kidnapper have been so thorough? No; surely not. Something else is going on.

    Your key somehow works on more doors, even though it shouldn’t. Yara is missing too, as are Serri, Etalyn, and whoever else you happen to check. After a while, you give up on opening random doors and rush out - no, no; calm down. Be careful. You carefully peek out the front doors and listen, attuning yourself to Soul and searching for any danger before you risk going out to look for anyone else.

    You should have tried that first. There’s no one here. There’s <em>nothing</em> here. Your usually oversensitive Soul picks up absolutely nothing at all. No Angels, no humans, not even any hint of the corruption that you had sort of been worried about. Not a single thing anywhere.

    It... it should be safe to go out. But to be doubly safe, you repeat the experiment with Mind and Body (i.e. your normal eyes) to confirm nothing in any of the three aspects. Just the empty Cathedra grounds, naked without their coating of mist and devoid of any signs of life.

With such a long line of sight, you should feel reasonably safe, but you just don’t. The world shouldn’t look like this.

    The Center is empty as well, its chairs and equipment neatly tidied up as if every dispatcher had just gone on break at once. You shouldn’t be surprised by now, but it’s still somewhat of a shock to see the normally-bustling office utterly silent. If anyone is left in the city - if there even still <em>is</em> a city - Angels will not be able to hear their pleas.

    “...”

    At this point, you’re almost certain that you’re the only person left in the world, but there are still some very big questions to answer. You eye the nearby fence; the city isn’t any less dark from here. You can’t tell if the buildings are still present, just hidden, or if they’re gone entirely.

    Another check of Soul and... oh <em>no</em>. There’s still nothing at all on this side of the fence, but Nucarreo simmers with icy cold darkness. You’ve never felt so much corruption before; it’s enough to almost knock you over with the force of its hatred. You know now, without even approaching the fence, that the city is gone. To go out there would be nothing but suicide; you can’t possibly stand up to such poison on your own.

    You flee inwards instead, eventually finding yourself near the Cathedra’s center: the Lordstone Cathedral. Surely, if anything has survived this utter apocalypse, it would be the fragment of God that lies in this very building.

    <em>Scene 118</em>
    The Lordstone is still there, but you can’t see much of it because there’s someone standing in front of it. He’s facing away at the moment, but you can tell he sort of looks like the Emissary. Just taller and more regal and with a faint glow like an Angelic Soul and... <em>and...?!?</em>

    “Er-” You struggle to decide what to say to this mysterious figure who is seemingly the only other person left in the world. But... here, and looking like that...? “Is... are you... G-God?”

    The man slowly turns to face you.

    And has the gall to laugh out loud. “I <em>said</em> you’d call me God next time we met! Ah, those divinations never fail, eh?”

    Now facing you, he doesn’t look like the Emissary - or God, whatever He might actually look like - at all. Average height, kind of pudgy, and with the Angelic glow revealed to actually just be the Lordstone’s own inner light. Plus, you recognize him. “... Phil? The-the oracle from the festival?”

    “The one and only! What brings you out here at this time of night?”

    “No; what brings <em>you</em> out here?! The city is gone; all the Angels are missing! What - what is going <em>on?”</em>

    “Hum, it does seem that we’ve met a rather grim fate here, doesn’t it?” He taps the Lordstone and it resonates with a melancholic chime. “But I can’t tell you why I’m here; that’s a question only <em>you</em> can answer.”

    “Why? I don’t know why you didn’t go away like everyone else!”

    “You know why you know. After all, you brought this night into existence.”

    “What do you-” Finally the absurdity of the situation sinks in. “This isn’t real. I’m dreaming.”

    Phil sits down in the Emissary’s throne, crossing his legs in a way that would probably be blasphemous if it were actually happening for real. “So, you tell me. What are you dreaming about?”

Is... is this what happens if He... goes away?”

    Phil shrugs. “Beats me. Mostly because you don’t know either, huh?”

    “That’s not very helpful,” you complain, faintly baffled by this whole scenario. “Are you just a piece of my Mind, or are you actually something else? And if you are a part of me, shouldn’t you be less annoying?”

    “Are you saying you don’t get annoyed by yourself on a regular basis?”

    “...”

    “Besides, isn’t there a reason you decided for me to be here instead of anyone else?” Phil leans forward, smiling in an unsettling way. “Are you <em>worried</em> about something, little Jessie?”

    “Don’t call me that.” You’ll answer to your actual name, and “Jess” is fine because that’s what Seth calls you, but “Jessie” is... you just don’t like it. You don’t need a reason for everything! “And I’m worried about a lot of stuff. You... know that, if you’re actually part of me.”

    “So, why me? Worried about that betrayal? It’s been a while since that fortune, mmm? Wondering who it will be? Wondering about when?”

    “... No. Stop talking, please.” The somber dread of before - when you had been wandering alone through the Cathedra - has all but evaporated and this fake-Phil is really getting on your nerves. Since you’re presumably talking to yourself, you’re a little bolder than usual, it seems. “Can I make you shut up?”

    “You can do whatever you want. I’m just here to watch.”

    “Then please be quiet.”

The Lordstone itself doesn’t do anything special either, as it’s apparently just an empty copy spawned from your Mind. Is this it, really? Just some spooky ambiance and an annoying oracle? You’re not worried about that fortune at all; it’s probably not even true.

    <em>“A secret will be revealed that should have remained hidden.”</em>

    What else could that be but Naoriel’s parentage? But you’re already dealing with the betrayer Archangel, as you’ve dubbed them, and you don’t exactly consider them a friend. The betrayal there is more against the Cathedra or the concept of Angelhood than you personally. So who could it possibly be? Who would turn against you in such a situation? You don’t really have that many friends to choose from, and you’re confident in the loyalty of each.

    ... But that’s what makes a betrayal so painful, isn’t it? That you don’t see it coming. So who would be the least likely? Yara? Naoriel herself? You don’t believe either would do anything like that. But... like <em>what?</em> The fortune was so vague you don’t even know what you’re supposed to be worried about!

    Not-Phil grins in his chair; you scowl at him. He’s enjoying this.

    “... Fine,” you mutter. “I <em>am</em> worried. Because you mentioned it. So... do something useful and tell me who it’s going to be!”

    “I’m afraid I can’t do that, since-”

    “You’re just part of me and I don’t know either; I get it. So why are you here at all if you can’t be helpful?”

    “Just to watch.”

    “Watch <em>what?”</em>

    “Oh, you know. You have a feeling something big’s coming soon, don’t you? So probably that.”

    “Huh? When did I say tha-”

    You wake up to bright sunlight, feeling like the room’s spinning around you. You feel like your dreams were weirder than normal, but the details escape you. There was... it was dark, and... the oracle was there...? You talked about something, but...?

    <em>Scene 119</em>
    You spend a lot of time with Yara and Erich over the next few months, helping them work on and test out their new detection spell. It’s the first time you’ve collaborated with other Angels to make your very own spell - well, it’s your first time doing that even without the collaboration aspect - so there’s lots to learn. For instance, how do you share progress or an idea with your partners?

    It’s not like you can just explain the specific movements you’re making with your Soul to them - language just isn’t precise enough and you don’t have any tools to measure anything specific. Even if you could say “move X inches to Y angle at Z seconds” or something, trying to actually follow those instructions would be far too difficult. That’s one of the reasons that miracle books are so lengthy and so complicated; they have to explain the exact effects you’re supposed to be producing in such a way that you can produce them yourself. And your aspects will be very different from the author’s, so they often ask you to go by feeling or to work backwards from an effect or combination of effects you already know how to produce.

    But here, when you’re trying to develop something initially, writing out that level of detail would be entirely impractical. So, you get to put into practice some of your new, more advanced Mind abilities.

    Mind reading, the common people sometimes call it. The ability for an Angel to peer into someone’s head and understand them better than they could explain it in words. Sometimes people are uncomfortable with the intrusion, but in most cases it’s understood to be a useful tool to quickly gather specifics that a person just can’t articulate in any other way. As you’ve been working with Sister Noll for a while now on defenses, she’s willing to add some extra lessons on this topic - though of course she has to work swordsmanship into it somehow, too.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1247354698638557245 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1247354698638557245><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, June 3, 2024 9:02 PM">9:02 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Read my intentions. Connect to my Mind and anticipate where I will strike. Ignore my Body; I’m very skilled at misdirection. Mind only. Ready?”

    “... Ready.” You can feel a dim, churning sense of thoughts and directions. Is she going to try and trick you Mentally too? Of course she will; that’s what she does!

    “Focus...” Noll stalks forwards, raising her blade carefully. Still the training one, though that doesn’t make it much less intimidating.

    There’s a sudden surge; you can almost see your own shin. Which one? You have no idea, so instead you leap straight up... a second too early. Noll clobbers you in the side on your way back down, sending you tumbling across the sand.

    “That was almost very good,” she laughs, helping you up as you wipe sand off your back and prod at the new bruise. “But I think you know the timing was a little off.”

    “Yeah...”

    Those sessions with Noll continued for a while until you mostly got the hang of sending and receiving sensations, emotions, directions, and the like. It’s very difficult to do with anyone you don’t have a strong Mental connection with - such as Noll as your instructor or Yara and Erich as your partners in this experiment - and the range is very limited. Touch works best, even though that shouldn’t matter since physical contact is only required for Body spells.

    The reason for that, you figured out on your own, though! Physical contact is an inherently Mental action, alongside its more dominant Body trait. You have to think about why you’re doing it, what you’re doing, and what you think of the person you’re touching. Similarly, they’ll have thoughts about what you’re doing as well. Are you good enough friends to hold hands, or are you just acquaintances and you’ll make do with a brief tap? Do they think of you differently than you think of them? And that’s not to even mention all the... additional kinds of touches that people in... romantic relationships can think about. It’s a lot of information to process!

You can think about your relationship or actions you’re making or whatever whenever you want. Instead, the touch is more of just a focus; a way to tell yourself that <em>this</em> is what you’re thinking about right now, and that <em>this</em> is the most important thing to focus on at the moment. A way to trick yourself into paying more attention, you suppose. And for someone with as little practice as you (and, if you have to admit it, as prone to distraction as you) that sort of trick is very useful.

    So anyway, back to the spell. With all the above in Mind, the most effective way to share your ideas is to link your Mind to one of your partners... and then just demonstrate them. If you’re connected well enough, whoever is “riding along” in your Mind will experience the exact same motions and feelings that you used to produce your version of the spell. Although it can get a little embarrassing if your Mind wanders during the process or if you get distracted by something and suddenly Erich is listening to you think about whatever random thing about clocks (or whatever) suddenly occurred to you.

    You also have to be <em>terribly</em> careful not to think about Naoriel or <em>anything</em> she’s told you during these sessions. And of course, trying your best not to think about something is a surefire way to think about it. You’ve had your share of close calls, to the point where you’ve been pursuing another branch of internal Mental magic that would let you modify or suppress your own memories. Unfortunately, that’s transmutation and it’s far too difficult to master in any reasonable amount of time. Plus, you’d get really scared of doing something wrong and basically destroying your own Mind by forgetting which memories you even suppressed and being unable to get them back later.

You have to break off the connection more than once when a dangerous thought worms its way into your Mind, which can get pretty uncomfortable for whoever was in your head as they get unceremoniously ejected. But of course, you suffer your own fair share of ejections as Yara or Erich think about something they don’t want you to see, so the three of you mostly just forgive each other and admit you all have things to hide.

    And after all that work (and literal Mind reading), you’re really starting to get a better idea of how Erich thinks. You already know Yara pretty well, but this is the first time you feel like you’ve really started to understand Erich. He’s... actually a very hard worker, and he respects people who put in as much effort as he does. Maybe that’s why he’s been working with Yara so well; if there’s anyone to put in way more work than you’d expect on something Soul-related, it’s him.

    <em>Scene 120</em>
    It’s not like you suddenly think he’s perfect, of course. Despite that sort of attitude you’ve started to understand, and his less aggressive behavior towards you, he’s still got his fair share of flaws. For instance, Serri worked really hard during the basic magic course - and she still does! - but he never seemed to respect her. Is it because her results weren’t particularly impressive? Something else? You don’t know. And there’s still that question about his disdain for common people without ties to Angels or the Cathedra. But again, you don’t know. Haven’t asked; you have no idea how to phrase that question even if you wanted to.

    But in any case, the understanding you’ve gained helps and the two of you are getting along better. Friends? Maybe, maybe not. You’re really not sure what you think of Erich overall, given all the different opinions you’ve held over the time you’ve known him. It’s better than it was, and that’s probably good enough for now.

    ...

    “Ha! I knew I’d get you with that one!” Yara laughs, pointing at a “4” you’ve drawn on a map of the Cathedra. “I was actually in the garden <em>behind</em> it, in that little shed marked riiiiight... there.”

    Erich leans over, comparing his map to yours. “And in Forger Hall?”

    “Hum... two rooms down from yours and... one in the other direction from Jessamine’s. Looks like accuracy still isn’t great through a lot of obstacles.”

    “But the range has vastly improved.”

    “Oh yes! And I’m quite satisfied with that. I think at this point, we have a tool that will be extremely helpful if we can teach it to others.”

    “How does it work against the corruption, though?” you ask, leaning back against the cool stone wall. Everything’s cool down here; it’s winter. “You were having trouble finding Souls you weren’t familiar with last time.”

It’s quite difficult to pick out the specifics of corruption I haven’t seen before - but I still get a general sense. More like ‘something is nearby’ than ‘something is in that building,’ but it’s still better than the baseline passive range by several times.”

    Erich frowns. “Not what we were hoping for.”

    “But better than we were expecting!” Yara counters happily. “Listen, let’s wrap up this project for the year, take some time off, and come back in the new year for some final polish and tweaks. Then, I’d like to demonstrate this to, hum. Stella? Or Zeke, perhaps?”

    “Doesn’t Zeke hate you?”

    “Less so these days, but I suppose you’re right. I’ll mention it to Stella, then.”

    You’ve never met Stella, but apparently she’s a pretty important Angel in the space of detecting threats inside the city. She’ll probably be interested in this spell and it’s certainly easier to get her attention (as she works with Yara directly) than an Archangel or bishop who might only remember him from the more public problems of a while ago. Or, y’know, Zeke who was originally convinced Yara was practicing forbidden magic.

    “Sounds fine. I suppose I’ll be glad to have a break from all this.” Erich seems huffy, but you’re pretty sure he actually isn’t. It’s harder to tell with him than Yara.

    “Well then, shall we clean everything up? Don’t want anyone getting into our equipment while we’re out. Or worse: the notes.”

    But it’s only a few minutes into your cleaning that a knock comes from the door. You, coincidentally closest, walk over to open it.

    “Oh, hey Jess.” Etalyn’s not in her uniform today, but her casual clothes aren’t much less strict. “You still holding Yara in there?”

    “He’s here; we’re just cleaning up. Yara?”

    “Hello!” he calls from the opposite corner of the lab, piling some stuff on a table and bounding over. “Oh dear; don’t tell me I’ve misread the clock?”

    “Alas!” he cries, dramatically falling into Etalyn so she has to catch him. “Relinquished into the clutches of - well, perhaps it’s not so bad.”

    She rolls her eyes. “Let’s go. Thanks, you two. You can make him do the next cleanup on his own if you want.”

    “Alas! Again!”

    And they’re off. How exciting; that could have almost been like the start of a <em>date,</em> happening right in front of you! So brazen! But you should probably finish up that cleaning.

    “Er, it’s okay if you want to just do your third,” you offer. “I know I said it was okay without asking.”

    “It’s maybe five minutes of extra work, Jessamine,” he counters. “I’ll do half.”

    A few more moments pass. “Didn’t expect that break to start so soon, heh.”

    “You should have asked where they were going. It’s always interesting to see what kind of excuse they come up with.”

    “I know, right! One of these days they’re just gonna have to admit they’re going out to dinner because they’re dating! It’s not e-embarrassing or anything; just admit it!”

    “You wouldn’t look at them differently?”

    “I already know! So does everybody!”

    “I suppose that’s true. Do you have the grey binder over there somewhere?”

    “Er... yes; just a minute.”

    “No need; I’ll come get it.”

    It’s not very often that you’re alone with Erich - pretty much the only times are ones like this, when Yara has to go somewhere and leaves you two to wrap things up. But this time - almost certainly because of what you were just talking about - is the first time you’ve felt kind of weird about it. There’s no reason to, really, but obviously just <em>telling</em> yourself that doesn’t work.

    “Looking forward to the festival this year? Seems you’ll have plenty of time off to go, unless you’re behind on coursework.”

It’s just kinda slushy and cold and there’s a weird amount of theater?” You look down, lowering your voice as you remember. “Plus, there was a weird guy who told my fortune and I didn’t really like him.”

    “An oracle? Don’t put stock in anything they say. It’s all nonsense and mathematics.”

    “I <em>know</em> that, but - ugh, he was just really - anyway, whatever. I’m not really looking forward to it, I guess.”

    “It sounds like you’ve only been to the common festival; it’s aimed at the masses and thus doesn’t specialize in anything. If your Day of Body is free, perhaps I could show you a more interesting festival?”

    Wwaaaiiittt a minute; you’re not sure if it’s just the lingering topic of Yara and Etalyn making you think like this, but he’s not - he isn’t... asking you on a date? Right? <em>Is</em> he? He doesn’t <em>look</em> like he is; maybe it’s all just normal and you’re overreacting again, like you <em>always</em> tend to do. That makes sense. Yeah. Calm down; don’t be dumb over nothing.

    But...?

    Stop it! So. What do you say?

    <em>Scene 121</em>
    “So I said I’d think about it and ran off really quick afterwards.”

    Yara hesitates a few moments before replying. You found him later that night after he and Etalyn got back from wherever they were and asked him for advice. Then, after he of course agreed, you very quickly explained everything that happened after he left, leaving no room for questions. “When you said advice, I didn’t think you meant <em>relationship</em> advice! What makes you think I’m even remotely qualified to dispense such wisdom?”

    “Um, you... and, er...” Of course it’s hard to just <em>say</em> it! “Etalyn...” you manage to mumble.

    “What? There’s not - we aren’t-” A pause; he looks at you again, seeming to understand. “... How obvious is it, really?”

    “H-how obvious?! Yara, <em>everybody</em> knows!”

    “Everybody?”

    “<em>Everybody.</em> Me, Serri, E-Erich, Naoriel; even Clarity, and you know that means half the Cathedra knows by now!”

    “Hum.”

    “... Did you really not know? I mean, just today she came to pick you up for a d-date, right in front of us!”

    “Goodness, you’re quite perceptive, aren’t you?”

    “Maybe you’re right; maybe you <em>aren’t</em> qualified to give this kind of advice.”

    Yara waves his hands as if to swat away that accusation. “No no no; this won’t do at all! You came to me for help, so by my honor as a friend - and apparently quite an oblivious person - help I shall! Now, let’s see here...”

    “I just don’t even know if I was overreacting or...”

    “Well I’m afraid I’m quite hopeless in that regard as well. Ets had to be very direct or I never would have figured anything out. It certainly doesn’t seem like he meant anything beyond the obvious, but what is considered ‘obvious’ varies from person to person, hmm?”

    “So...?”

So we can consider both cases individually.” Yara nods to himself, clearly pleased with his deduction. “If we assume that his motives were purely platonic, would you want to spend a festival day with him?”

    “I don’t know; that’s the problem! He’s so weird; I just can’t get a handle on him! First he was all aloof and grumpy, then he kept having to beat me at everything in basic magic, and then he started getting all friendly and now he’s even trying to make jokes!” You spread your hands in confusion. “Jokes! I don’t think he even understands how to not sound completely serious, but he’s trying!”

    Yara raises an eyebrow, half-smiling. “Jessamine, I don’t mean to alarm you, but that progression sounds very familiar.”

    “What do you mean?”

    “Well, our lovely Etalyn wasn’t always so cheery, was she? Her ‘aloof and grumpy’ phase was before you joined us, but I’m certain you recall how consistently she proved her dominance on the battlefield. Or, well, the training grounds.”

    “She was even more grumbly before...? Wait, that’s not - you think... he’s, er-??”

    “Oh, I have no idea! Completely oblivious and unqualified to provide this sort of advice, remember?” Yara chuckles at your expression. “But perhaps, if he thinks in a somewhat similar way?” A pause; he considers something. “Actually, I believe our first outing even started in a somewhat similar manner. It was a holiday and Ets asked me to come out to the city with her. Of course, she was certainly more direct, but she always is.”

    You latch onto that detail. “Holiday? Wait; was that...” Quick; count up the years. Only one? “Endle Day of last year? When I asked you for help disguising myself?”

    “That’s the one!”

    “<em>I knew it!</em> You said nothing interesting happened, but that was a lie!”

    “Dear, oh dear. Classic deflection techniques. Wasn’t this conversation supposed to be about <em>you?”</em>

Sorry.”

    He pats your shoulder. “Maybe we’ll try the other scenario first. If his intentions are in fact romantic, would you be happy with that? You wouldn’t be committing to a relationship even if you do go, but of course anything could happen out in the city. Pleasant, or extremely awkward.”

    “...” You’re sure you’re blushing, but thankfully Yara doesn’t mention it. What are you supposed to say to that? You just don’t know! It’s not like you hate him or anything, and you might even be kinda-sorta friends after all this work on the spell you still don’t have a real name for? But... thinking about him like <em>that...?</em> Are you even old enough for that sort of thing? With anyone? Let alone anyone you don’t know how you feel about?

    But you’re an Angel, too, which means you’re theoretically more mature than an average person your age - but you know from experience that’s a total lie and it’s just that you’re smarter, not that you’re better at managing your emotions... but you <em>sort of</em> are after your Mind training... but that’s sort of magical cheating as opposed to “real” competence. What were you thinking about, again?

    “Oh dear, we’ve lost her. Jessamine, are you in there?”

    “Wagh! J-just... thinking!”

    “Mm hmm! Reach any conclusions?”

    “... That I’m really bad at focusing on stuff like this?”

    “Hmmm...” He rubs his chin for effect. “You’re a tricky one. How about we try from a different angle?”

    “... Such as?”

    “Well, you keep saying you don’t know much about him, so you don’t know if you want to go. But going out for a day would certainly help you learn quite a lot about him! And wouldn’t that acquisition of knowledge be worth any potential awkward moments you may - or may not! - have to endure? We’re even almost done with the project, so any potential problems won’t even ruin our collaboration!”

    “... Are you really that convinced it’ll go wrong?”

What part of ‘or may not’ or <em>‘potential’</em> isn’t clear? I feel there’s a perfectly reasonable chance that everything will go smoothly - you two get along just fine in the lab, after all!”

    “... I guess that makes sense.”

    He lets out a relieved breath. “Does it? Oh, good - I mean, of course it does! Because I am Extremely Competent in All Things Social!”

    You look up at him with a dumb little half-smile, still too confused to react any more dramatically.

    “Well, I believe that must be my advice, then. A multitude of words just to say ‘why not?’, I suppose. But the choice remains yours! And however it goes, I very much look forward to hearing how everything turns out!”

    “... If I go and tell you about it, can you tell me how that Endle Day went?”

    “Insatiable gossip! As bad as Clarity, aren’t you?”

    “I’m kidding. I don’t want to pry.”

    “Well! Then how about this: if you go, I won’t ask you about it! And if you don’t go, as well. I shall respect your privacy regardless!”

    “... Thanks, Yara.”

    ...

    So, here you are. A familiar scenario: lying awake in bed, staring at the dark ceiling. Confused. You don’t know how you feel about him, and you still don’t know if he even meant anything by his offer! Yara might be right; you would definitely learn more about him by going, but...

    You hesitate, pulling the sheets up to cover your face, unwilling to stare at the judgemental ceiling. It almost seems like you’ve been assuming it’ll go wrong this whole time. Are you really that scared of him? What if everything goes well? What if you <em>do</em> end up... l-liking him? You pull the sheets tighter, imagining the ceiling laughing at you.

    It was one sentence! He said <em>one sentence</em> and you’ve been obsessing about it all evening! God, you’re such a mess. You have no idea what you’re doing.

    <em>Scene 122</em>
    <em>Maybe I won’t even see him for the next few days and then I won’t have to say anything! Or he won’t bring it up or something.</em> You try to convince yourself to go find him and settle it anyway, but it’s just too scary. <em>If he shows up and says something about it, I’ll respond. Otherwise...</em>

    But of course, you quickly run into him tomorrow. You’re not in any of the same courses since the basic magic one is finished, but you often spot him in Oth Hall around lunchtime; seemingly his schedule ends up around the same place as yours at midday. Today is no exception and you don’t really have any option but to at least talk with him briefly, even if you want to pretend like you’re already done with lunch. Which would also be really obvious, so after some consideration you just give up and wait for him to come sit down.

    You feel your anxiety building as he talks about normal things for a while, willing him to just ask you already but also too worried to bring it up yourself. <em>Is he not going to bring it up? Was it nothing important to him? Did he not stay up thinking about what I meant? WAS I just overreacting after all?</em>

    “Oh, I don’t suppose you’ve decided if you want to join me for the festival?” he asks, as if it just occurred to him. “I don’t want to rush you if you’re still deciding on other plans, but I do need to place a reservation soon.”

    Okay, this is it. Stay calm; you’re just doing this to learn more about him. Nothing more. “O-oh? Er, s-sure.” Your voice is very quiet.

    “What was that? I’m sorry; it’s quite loud in here.”

    <em>Too quiet!</em> You clear your throat and try again. “O-okay. I’ll g-go.”

    “Oh, excellent! We can probably meet up at...”

Only now are you finally starting to calm down.

    <em>He didn’t seem flustered at all!</em> you note, to your annoyance. Maybe it really is just a platonic thing and you’ve been freaking out for the past almost-day for nothing. Or maybe he’s just really good at looking calm even if he isn’t? Or maybe he’s so... experienced that even an actual romantic thing doesn’t rattle him? You still know so little about him... which is of course what all this is meant to help.

    In any case, the last few days before the festival pass quickly. You don’t hear anything about doing A Thing as trainees this year and kind of wonder who made that decision last year. Or maybe something went wrong? Anyway, it’s now the Day of Body and you’ve got to figure out what to wear.

    Your non-uniform coat, obviously, since it’s going to be cold, and probably the scarf and such you used last time to hide your Angelic features just in case you can’t hold the disguise all day. Better safe than the alternative. But under that? Are you going to be inside at all? On the train at least, but beyond that? What did you choose? Oh, why can’t you <em>remember?</em>

    At this point you’ve got quite a few options in your closet, mostly gifts or suggestions from Clarity on your various outings. Should you dress up? Go for utility? Do you need pants for something or should you wear a dress? God; you just don’t know!

    Okay, think about it. You’re pretending to be a regular human, so you would be cold. You should wear warm clothes, even though you probably won’t <em>need</em> to. So... this and... like a sweater, probably? Does that go well together? Are you fashionable? Do you need to be? Come on; you’re going to be in your coat almost all day anyway! It doesn’t matter!

You don’t really like looking at your disguised form, though, so you make that part brief. And you make sure to watch the mirror as you release it and return to your normal, perfect Body. That’s better. If only you could look like this in the city proper.

    Well, time to go meet Erich. You hope you don’t run into anyone else (except possibly Yara; he’d probably be okay) on your way.

    And luckily, you don’t. It helps that you’re not meeting with him in Hearth Hall (even though that would make sense as you both live there) - instead, you head to one of the many nearby shrines. This one appears to be devoted to honesty, which is kind of an interesting choice. You briefly consider if maybe this is Erich very very subtly hinting at something, but discard that idea quickly. It’s probably just the closest shrine to the Hall.

    But then, why go here at all when you could have just met downstairs...?

    You don’t have time to ponder that as he’s already here waiting for you. “Good morning,” he says pleasantly, emerging from the shrine to walk with you to the gate. He’s also wearing a coat so you can’t tell if you’re dressed too nice or not. You’ll find out on the train, you suppose.

    “Er, yeah. It kinda is.” A moment passes; you realize he was just greeting you normally and wasn’t actually remarking on the goodness of this particular morning. What is <em>wrong</em> with you?

    Erich regards the gently falling snow that crunches underfoot; the cleaning crews haven’t gotten around to clearing off the overnight snowfall from all the paths yet. “You appreciate winter, then?”

    “Er... yeah,” you repeat, still berating yourself for that previous mistake. “It’s... peaceful like this. Clean and soft and quiet.”

    “... The stars? You can’t actually see them from the city, though.”

    “Well, no, but it’s certainly closer when the fog is thin. Sometimes, when it’s particularly warm, dry, and dark, you <em>can</em> see the moon.”

    “Really? That’d be so cool; I’ve never seen anything up there but just mist. Is it just like the sun, but dimmer?” You look up, trying to find the sun, but the angle is wrong; there’s a building in the way. It’s pretty early in the morning as well, so it would appear as nothing more than an orange glow in the fog.

    “Somewhat. The moon’s light is much more blue than the sun’s, and its shape is...” He considers for a few moments. “Longer? It’s more of a <em>smear</em> than a diffuse glow. Of course, I’ve only seen it twice, so I’m hardly an expert.”

    “Why would it look like that?” you wonder aloud. “Isn’t it supposed to be just as round as the sun? Does it move faster, so that’s why it’s stretched out?”

    “I’m not sure. I hope to see it without obstructions in the future.”

    “In the wastelands...”

    “Indeed.”

    You disguise up and pass by the gate guards, exiting into the city and heading for the central station. As usual, if you don’t have any official Angel business, it’s hardly ever worthwhile taking a train from the Cathedra station. Here, the roads have been mostly swept clear of snow; what little remains is melted into slush by passing people and carriages. You can already hear the massive festival in the central square; you’ll have to pass by it to get to the station.

    “By the way, Jessamine, how did you learn to swim?”

    “Eh?”

    “Well, after what you said the other day, I was just curious; most people don’t have the time, money, or reason.”

There are some pools here and there, but they tend to be for upper-class people only given the resources needed to maintain them (especially in winter!). Erich is right: as a firmly middle-class household, you never had a pressing reason to spend all that effort to learn.

    So...

    <em>Scene 123</em>
    “I, er, don’t... know what you’re talking about. I never learned how to swim.”

    “Really? Then, did I mishear when you mentioned you wanted to go to a pool today?”

    <em>Is that one of the things I chose? I need to... I don’t even know what I need to do!</em> You don’t hate the idea, but it’s definitely not something you would have picked if you had been in sound Mind - since, of course, the most you could do is wade around. Or drown. And that would be awfully embarrassing, among other things. “Er... did I?” <em>C’mon, make it seem intentional!</em> “Y-yeah; do you <em>need</em> to know how to swim to go?”

    “... I suppose not. My apologies for assuming.”

    Success! Sort of. Although of course, you’re now thinking about all the other logistical problems that could go wrong with your half-excuse. Were you supposed to bring a change of clothes? Erich doesn’t seem to be carrying anything, so maybe not? Are you just going to sit there while he has fun? Why didn’t you just admit it was a mistake? You’re so on edge already and you haven’t even gotten to the train station yet!

    Thankfully, nothing else goes wrong on the way there. You get tickets to district seven and board a train not long after, finally getting to be relieved that you aren’t overdressed; Erich is also wearing a fairly nice outfit. Of course, he usually is, but... you know.

    “Heh, we’re almost matching,” you point out, moving your arm next to his so he can compare the colors of your sleeves. “See? Why’d you pick maroon?”

    “Hum; I’m not sure. Why did <em>you</em> pick maroon?”

    “Because that’s the color of this sweater and I wanted to look warm.” You probably should have said <em>be</em> warm, but the way you phrased it is closer to the truth. It’s not really all that cold out today; you could have been fine with lighter clothes. It just would have been a little obvious.

    “Well, I suppose that’s a similar reason. I don’t have a lot of clothing that isn’t... perhaps too formal.”

    He almost seems surprised by that. “I-is it not?”

    “I mean... you’re wearing a jacket? And not a cold-weather one, like a suit one?”

    “This isn’t a suit jacket; it’s just a blazer. It should be appropriate for semi-formal occasions such as an outing like this?”

    “Er-” You narrowly avoid asking what the difference is because you’re sure you wouldn’t be able to grasp it without examples. Instead, you glance behind him to some of the other people on the train. “I think informal might be more like what those men are wearing. See; they’ve just got regular coats, regular shirts, and maybe those little poofy hats?” A pause; you consider something.

    “Poofy-”

    “Erich, we need to get you a hat. Wouldn’t that be cute? Like... ugh, I don’t want to be rude by pointing, but like that guy’s? Don’t you think that’d be fun?”

    “...”

    Ack; what are you <em>doing?!</em> You quickly return to a more neutral, forward-facing posture as the train slows to round a bend. Even you can’t explain what’s going on with your mood today, shifting all over the place as your anxiety rises and falls. “Er, nevermind.”

    He carefully pats the top of his head, seemingly considering it. “Perhaps if we pass by a store... But I’m not certain it would fit me.”

    “They have multiple sizes - oh, that’s not what you meant.” A pause. “Erich, why <em>are</em> you so formal all the time? You’re always dressed up and tidy and that sort of thing.”

    Again, your mouth has run ahead of your Mind. Too much strain from all the worrying is making it harder to filter what you should say? Does that make sense? Well, you can’t take it back now and it wasn’t <em>that</em> rude, really.

    “I don’t believe I’m <em>that</em> formal. I just like to take care of myself. It befits someone of our... status to maintain a proper appearance.”

    “I guess so, but it doesn’t do you any harm to relax every so often, right?”

    “Which I can do in this outfit without issue.”

You remember his father is a hospital administrator - of the very hospital in the sixth district where you were confined during your illness, coincidentally - which probably means his family was quite high class even before his Ascension.

You know he tends to look down on ordinary humans, so maybe it’s related to that?

    ... You should probably give him the benefit of the doubt and just believe his explanation before accusing him of <em>that</em> wild theory. You may be a little out of sorts today, but even in your current state you know saying something like that would be <em>terribly</em> rude.

    You glance over at Erich again; he’s already looking in your direction and it’s a little awkward for a moment before he speaks up. “So, would you consider <em>your</em> outfit particularly formal?”

    “Er-” How are you supposed to answer that? You spent like twenty minutes trying things on before deciding on this; should you admit that it’s the most exactingly semi-formal thing you could find? “... Noooo?”

    “So this is you dressing less formal, even though you also seem better dressed than most of the women on this train?”

You didn’t even <em>think</em> about that; your definition of “formal” is way off from spending most of your time in the Cathedra or in the company of people like Clarity! If you asked <em>her</em> for “formal,” she’d probably give you a dress made of clouds or something! (note to self: see if that’s even possible later.) But although your cute maroon sweater seems just semi-formal from your perspective, most of the women on this train are in just their normal brown or cream dresses with a jacket on top. The color <em>alone</em> makes you stand out, and that’s to say nothing of the generally higher quality and the accessories you picked out. Most people in Nucarreo simply couldn’t afford to waste money on something like this.

    “Erm...” You really don’t have a good answer. Are you really this out of touch with normal people already? “... I see your point.”

    “Don’t feel flustered about it. I think you deserve to look nice.”

    And then he quickly turns away, ostensibly suddenly very interested in a landmark on the other side of the train. You look out your own window (he gave you the window seat) and try to see if you’re blushing in the reflection. Okay, you definitely weren’t sure for quite some time and you still aren’t <em>totally</em> sure but... come on. This - at this point... With his behavior and... He meant for... well, for th-this to be a... d-date, right?

    That thought doesn’t help with the blush. You’ve got to calm down, quick. Before you have to turn around again.

    <em>Scene 124</em>
    Not too long after that conversation, your train pulls into the district seven central station and you disembark. It’s a little colder here, right on the riverbank, and the station has a kind of interesting design to account for that. The platform is actually curved to match the shape of the river and you have to be extra-careful to step over the larger than normal gap. It’s odd, since there are plenty of elevated stations around the city; this one could have just gone <em>over</em> the river. Maybe they wanted the central station to be on ground level, or didn’t want to risk a train falling in the water.

    Erich takes the lead (which is good, since you don’t know where you’re going) and shows you a neat little switchback-staircase carved into the riverbank and paved with stones. It’s just outside the station, but there’s no signage and it’s not very visible from any of the main roads. But it’s convenient, since it gets you all the way down to the water (well, mostly ice at the moment) much faster than the main path a few streets away.

    There’s a gate, but someone left it open and there’s no sign telling you not to, so you don’t feel too worried about tentatively stepping out onto the Endle River itself. A lot of it is fully covered in snow, but there are some sections where that’s been cleared away to reveal ice beneath. There are plenty of people on the river today: enterprising fishermen drilling into the water beneath to catch what chilled fish still pass through, large groups of kids and their parents playing in the massive amounts of unspoiled snow, and a number of other people just walking around like you.

    “We’ll be coming back here in the afternoon,” Erich informs you as he heads further upstream. “But for now, the caves are just a ten-minute walk this way.”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1250962581401899029 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1250962581401899029><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 13, 2024 7:58 PM">7:58 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“The caves?” you narrowly stop yourself from saying. You’re supposed to remember what’s going on and that would probably be a little too direct. Still, the caves? Like the ones that you worked at briefly last year... and Erich was there too, now that you think about it. Probably not quite the same, since you’re on the river this time. You’re not very knowledgeable about fungi, but something tells you they don’t grow <em>in</em> water. Maybe <em>near</em> it, you suppose. But why would he be taking you to a grimy, dark farm, essentially? He hated it in those caves.

    You don’t have to wait long to find out, as the two of you are both more fit than whoever made the ten minute estimate and make it there ahead of schedule. These caverns are far from the dimly-lit grotto you farmed fungi in; instead, they’re massive tunnels bored into the riverbank by some incredible force of the distant past. Ice coats the floor - presumably these caves are flooded in the summer - as well as forms into sparkling stalactites on the walls and ceiling. The still-rising sun is angled just right to pass its diffuse yellow-orange glare along the semitranslucent ice, lining the entire cavern with fangs of fiery gold.

    “... Wow,” you admit.

    “And <em>that</em> is why I said we had to come here first,” Erich says proudly. “The sun only lines up like this for a few minutes.”

    You do vaguely remember him saying something about that, now that the swirling worries in your Mind have been forcefully ejected by the spectacle. “Imagine what it’d be like if there weren’t all this mist here.”

    “Even more brilliant, I imagine.”

Clearly, Erich isn’t the only person to know about this place, as there are plenty of other people gathered around getting in your way and talking about whatever strikes their fancy. For a moment, jostled by a woman who wasn’t looking where she was going, you feel a surge of annoyance, but it’s replaced by curiosity as you spot several people disappearing into the cavern’s mouth.

    With the overhanging roof starting to obscure the sun, the light show is nearing an end; the crowd starts to dissipate. “Erich, where are those two going?” you ask, pointing into the cave.

    “Where do you think?” he asks in return, angrily dodging around a man backing up to get a better view. “The caves in this city run deep, and these flooded ones are connected to the main network. Some people like to explore a few rooms in and see what interesting ice formations have popped up this year.”

    He stops just short of inviting you to go in, but he doesn’t have to. Of course you want to; <em>look</em> at this place! “How far can we go?” You take a few steps forward, straining to see past the entryway. No good; too much glare from the ice even for your eyes.

    “Probably farther than <em>they</em> can. But not too deep; we don’t want to spend hours in there.”

    You’re already moving forward; Erich picks up the pace to catch up. “Back here? Ooh, the light reflects way further than I thought! It’s like the whole tunnel is glowing!”

    ⏪ - See a few rooms and head back out. Don’t get carried away.

    <em>Scene 125</em>
    Erich is right; these caves are <em>massive.</em> Even though you don’t have any equipment, your light Body combined with your Angelic strength lets you clamber up and down and all around the tunnels without too much difficulty. The only parts you have trouble with are vertical shafts where the walls are covered in ice - you can’t get any good handholds as the whole thing is just too slippery. Thankfully, there aren’t many of those and you’re able to just avoid them.

    In fact, staring up at one such narrow passage in the ceiling, you kind of wonder how and why it would have been formed at all. Were all these caves formed just by the passage of water from the river? Why are they so twisty-turny if that’s the case? The river itself just keeps going over that way; how much water does it lose down these holes? And where does it all go?

    “What do you think’s down there?” you ask at one point, standing on a solid plug of ice that extends down further than you can see, even with your glow at maximum strength (you don’t have any lights, so this is the best you can do). “It just keeps going down. This can’t possibly melt every year, right?”

    Erich pokes around the edges of the room, his glow similarly reflecting off the walls. “I doubt it. The river doesn’t lose that much water and we’ve been going up for a while... I think. This is probably permanent.”

    “I wonder if there’s a way to get below it.” You hesitate, thinking back to your time underground at the mushroom farm. That time when you stared at the elevator, wondering how deep into the poisoned earth you could go before the very dirt and rocks started to hate you. Before the wastelands stretched beneath your feet as well as past the walls around the city. “Hey, er-”

    “Ah, found something!” He beckons you over. “See, there’s a small fissure here that seems to lead further down.”

There’s a small crack in the cavern wall here, forming a narrow, ice-covered passageway down into some unknown chamber below. You try to trace it through the semitransparent main plug, though the ice isn’t clear enough to get more than a vague outline. “It almost seems like it goes <em>into</em> this ice here,” you note, tapping your foot on the floor for emphasis. “How does that make sense?”

    “It doesn’t. This passage goes through the rock and would have been carved well before the ice plug froze here. You’re probably seeing it winding along the <em>edge</em> of the plug.”

    “Hmm...” You lean a little closer, trying to see better inside. “It’s just this first bend; if I could see past that, I could...” You grab onto a wedge of ice from the fissure’s edge, holding onto it as you lean further into the fissure. Still just a little out of sight.

    “Careful,” Erich warns. “That’s not stable-”

    With a sudden snap, the ice you’re holding gives way. You scream for an instant as - unable to get any grip on the icy walls that almost resemble a slide from this angle - you topple into the passage.

    But then you’re falling <em>backwards</em> and hit the ground on top of something softer and warmer than ice. It only takes you a moment to work out what happened, heart pounding from the near miss.

    “Are you okay?” Erich asks, muffled from somewhere beneath you. He managed to pull you back just in time, causing you both to fall over on the slick ice. Or, well, him onto the ice and you onto him. He’s still gripping you tightly for a moment before relaxing as you respond.

    “F-fine,” you manage, disentangling yourself into a sitting position. “... And you?”

    “No issues,” he grunts, sitting up and rubbing the back of his head. “Just glad I was fast enough.”

    A few more seconds to catch your breath. “... Thanks. That was really stupid of me.”

    “... Yes.”

    Ouch.

    “But neither of us are injured and we’ve learned not to do that again, so it could have gone significantly worse.”

Yeah.” You feel up to the task of standing again and help Erich up as well. “Maybe we should go back.”

    “That sounds smart.”

    A pause.

    “It... it was this way, right?”

    “... Probably,” he agrees.

    As luck would have it, you were completely wrong. Thankfully, you figured that out quickly as the ground started sloping down and the ice started to be replaced by more standard rock and dirt. This way almost certainly leads into the main cavern network, and though you <em>could</em> maybe stumble upon a farm or elevator down there, it would be treacherous and you’re in no mood to risk any more injury than you already have.

    So instead, you go the other way and are able to find your way back out with only a few backtracks and turnarounds. The light helps, once you get close enough for it to reflect again, as does the sound echoing from the outside. But mostly, it’s just the elevation. You were going up to get there, so you’re going down to get out. But not too far down.

    ... It’s harder than you’d prefer, but at least you don’t get lost in the caves for too long.

    When you finally do emerge back onto the Endle River, the sun is already high overhead and the morning’s snow has stopped. It’s bright, even though the mist. You apologize to Erich again for all the trouble (after which he tries to reassure you there’s nothing to apologize about) and then it’s off to get some lunch before your next scheduled activity.

    Which, as it turns out, is ice skating. Earlier, you saw some groups practicing or individuals flying past on sections of the river clear of snow; apparently it’s relatively popular in the wealthier section of the district around here. “Although,” Erich says as you’re eating. “I wouldn’t blame you if the spelunking this morning was enough excitement. Do you still want to go?”

    <em>Scene 126</em>
    “Sure,” you say, kinda confused. “It wasn’t that big of a deal, right? I didn’t <em>actually</em> fall in.”

    “I suppose not. You haven’t skated before, have you?”

    “Not at all. I’m hoping all the-” You lower your voice a little. “- Body training will make it easier. I’m supposed to be really graceful, right?”

    “Yes, it should help. But don’t get too discouraged if it’s difficult.”

    “Erich, it took me months to even get my glow under control. I won’t get discouraged.”

    ...

    And thus, you don’t.

    Really, that’s not a lie. You’re not immediately great at skating, but it doesn’t take you long to pick up the basics and you’re able to move along at a fairly decent - and fairly stable - pace by the end of it. It’s pretty fun to be able to glide along the ice - at least as long as you stick to the smooth parts without too many bumps. Uneven ice is <em>not</em> pretty fun, you decide. At least not in these circumstances.

    Erich has clearly practiced this before. He’s able to turn and move around much more fluidly than you can - showing off again? - and helps teach you techniques beyond those that the actual instructor demonstrates. Since you’re both busy skating around (and fast), you don’t get much time to talk, but you do get some time to watch him.

    He generally avoids the other skaters around, which are all normal humans (you assume, at least; you’re not sure if you could recognize another disguised Angel without your Soul sense). There’s not any obvious animosity you can spot unless someone gets in his way or something - he just avoids everyone but you. At some point, you’ve really got to figure out how to bring that up with him without seeming rude or creepy.

It’s not like you’ve talked to anyone else aside from the instructor, really. That’s just because you don’t have any reason to interact with anyone, though, and... it’s probably normal and a good idea to stay out of everyone else’s way when everyone has knives strapped to their feet and are not very practiced at moving with them. Are you just being judgemental for no reason? He’s been perfectly pleasant today, as far as you recall.

    In the end, you don’t really learn anything from ice skating besides how to ice skate. Which isn’t a bad deal and you’re kind of curious how you might be able to combine it with magic later on. You vaguely imagine sliding down the frozen river, propelled by some nondescript magical force at speeds to match even the trains that run alongside it. That’d be cool, you think. Yeah. But probably not very feasible unless you were fighting something. Which wouldn’t be quite as cool. Your imaginary self gets eaten by some horrible corrupt fish rising from the water. You should probably pay attention to what’s actually going on instead of daydreaming.

    Right. It’s well into the afternoon now and you’re getting somewhat tired. Even with your stamina, you’ve been running around (or climbing, or skating, or almost falling) all day except for a brief break for lunch. So what better way to relax and conclude this outing (whatever it was) than by taking a train to the sixth district and warming up at a pool? Wait, the sixth district?

    “It’s the one my family tends to visit.”

    “Oh, that makes sense.”

    A few moments pass. The train clatters along a particularly rough section of track. “Is there something the matter with the sixth district?”

    “... No, I just kind of forgot you live there too.”

    “Lived there. We have a new home now.”

    “Oh, your family moved? What about the hospital?”

    “No, not them; <em>us.”</em>

That makes sense too.” A pause. “Do you not feel like you still...” You hesitate; try again. “Do you feel really distant from your family now?” Still not really what you wanted to say, but... you’ll see how he responds.

    “Of course. I rarely see them these days.”

    “That’s... not what I meant. More like, er, when you <em>do</em> see them... do you...” You sigh in frustration, not sure how to ask the question in a meaningful way. “Maybe this isn’t the right place to talk about this.” You doubt anyone would be purposefully eavesdropping on the train, but you never know. It’s easy enough to <em>accidentally</em> eavesdrop, anyway.

    “Later, then?”

    “Sure.”

    As it turns out, the pool is situated in a low, dark building that’s almost hidden behind the taller structures around it. When you enter, it’s obvious why it’s so short: the actual water is below street level. “Easier to move it and keep it warm that way,” Erich explains, not actually explaining why that’s the case. You can guess part of it: water is heavy and there are plenty of pipes belowground they could use to get it, but not so many above street level. But heating... maybe it’s warmer below ground? But the caves you were just in sure weren’t.

    In any case, your current outfit is predictably not appropriate swimming (or wading) attire. Thankfully, they have swimsuits you can just <em>have</em>... as long as you’re with Erich, whose parents are apparently pretty influential people around here. You decide not to worry overly much about it and just go change, agreeing to meet up with Erich again by the water.

    But... it’s a little embarrassing, isn’t it? You seem to have skimped a little on your disguise beyond what would be shown in your normal outfit, since there’s no point in wasting energy on stuff no one can see anyway. But now... you kinda look like a hybrid between Angel and human in the swimsuit. <em>Probably</em> should fix that before going out; it’s a real good thing you decided to look in the mirror beforehand.

    Although, you should probably decide if you want to try swimming or if you’ve had enough excitement for one day. You don’t know how, but you trust Erich to not let you drown if you try. Probably.

    <em>Scene 127</em>
    There are a few other groups here, mostly older people or small families, but the pools (there are a few of them, of different sizes and temperatures) are large and plentiful enough that you (again) don’t have to talk to anyone else. Similarly, the constant trickle of water means you’re likely not to be overhead except by people very nearby. Erich meets you near a small, isolated pool where the whole thing is shallow enough to stand in. Probably for the best, given that you don’t particularly want to drown today.

    “I had to redo my disguise,” you say as you approach. “That’s why it took so long.”

    “It seems to have been time well spent; you look perfectly ordinary.”

    “... Thanks?”

    The pool is nice and warm and constantly filled by a faucet on one side. Where does the water go when it overfills? You don’t know; does it matter? There’s even a little ledge around the side so you can sit down and be in the water up to your chin without having to crouch or anything. You’ve rarely (never?) been so cozy before in your life.

    “Good, isn’t it?”

    You’re melting, but that’s okay. “Yeah...”

    A few minutes pass. You feel like you might fall asleep, but you probably shouldn’t. The image of you passing out and slowly slipping beneath the water leads predictably to yet another imaginary drowning. You’re really obsessed with that today, aren’t you? Anyway, to prevent that sorry scenario, you raise your head a little bit to avoid getting water in your mouth, then try to follow up from before.

    “Hey, Erich, about what I asked about your family on the train...?”

    “This is later, then?”

    “Er, yes. I just meant...” You hesitate, having not actually prepared at all for your second attempt. Sometimes you wonder what it would feel like to be someone for which socializing came naturally. “... When I went to...” Another pause; maybe you shouldn’t lead with that. “Okay, how about ‘do you get along with your family?’ just to start with?”

I was going to take over my father’s role later in life, though of course that’s hardly plausible now.”

    Good; he’s not like Yara or Etalyn who both hate their families. Not that that’s a <em>bad</em> thing (well, it sort of is?), but it did stop you from comparing your experiences with them. “And have you visited them since you Ascended?”

    “Just once.”

    “... Did anything weird happen? Like, er, with your emotions...?”

    “... Jessamine, what are you getting at here? Nothing in particular that I can think of; it was a fairly ordinary few hours. Is this based on something that happened to you?”

    Well, it was probably pretty obvious. “... Yeah. When I went back to visit on my first Endle Day after Ascending, I just felt like a stranger. Like there wasn’t any sort of connection. I felt sorta numb until I left again.”

    “Your first Endle Day... So this isn’t the one where you sensed the lost Souls?”

    “No; the one before that.”

    “You already knew how to cast disguise magic in your first year? That was only two months after we started the basic magic course!”

    “... Yara escorted me and I stayed inside the whole day otherwise. But you didn’t have anything like that?”

    “No. Are you certain it wasn’t just Soul exhaustion? Emotional numbness is one of the major symptoms.”

    “No-” You hesitate, forcing yourself to consider his suggestion. The idea had occurred to you, but the fact that you hadn’t been using magic that day made it seem unlikely. But now, with his mention of your <em>second</em> Endle Day... “I don’t think so. I didn’t cast any spells that day. But... next year, there were those lost Souls and weird glove people?

    “Yeah, me too.”

    “Ah; it could have been two separate instances and just a coincidence that you happened to be involved both times.”

    “That’s true,” you murmur. It would be a nice convenient explanation that means you don’t have to admit that you changed and were seriously estranged from your family for a while. Sometimes coincidences like these do happen.

    “You know, we are in the sixth district again today. We could go and look around; see if there’s anything that could be causing this.”

    <em>Scene 128</em>
    “I guess, maybe?” You consider it for a few more seconds. “Sure. Let’s go look around a bit. In a bit.”

    You spend a good deal more time there, drifting in warm water and occasionally moving from pool to pool for no reason in particular. Even the air between the water is so suffused with moisture that it almost seems an extension of it. Such an incredible contrast from the dry, cold winter air outside.

    The two of you talk about other things for a while, but not about anything important (especially when you enter some of the larger or more central pools, where other people could hear you). You’ve basically reached the limit of how much serious stuff you want to do for the day, with the relaxing atmosphere just dragging you down to drift; almost to sleep. Well, going to hunt for corruption later will probably be serious again, but at the moment you have a hard time believing you’ll find anything. Surely a full Angel would have noticed by now. They do patrols, right?

    ... Clarity didn’t notice, or at least she wouldn’t have if you hadn’t told her what to look for. She’s not the most practiced full Angel around, but there are certainly some who aren’t as attentive. Whatever. Stop that; you’re getting back into your worries before you have to. Plenty of time to stress out later.

    Finally, as you’re wrapping up and starting to plan where to go afterwards, a very simple thing happens. Some random girl hurries by, Erich glances up as he notices, then back down again. You’re not even convinced he made any particular expression, but something about the non-interaction triggered a question before your Mind could catch up on if you should actually be asking - or at least phrase it better.

    “Erich, why do you hate regular people so much?”

Thankfully, you’re collected enough to avoid inhaling any water while you’re down there and emerge embarrassed but unharmed. Not so thankfully, you really don’t know how to follow up that brilliant performance and end up deciding to just wait for him to say something.

    “I don’t hate regular people. What do you mean?”

    Of course he’d say that. Well, you’re in it now. “O-ordinary humans. Not Angels. It’s just... whenever you talk about them, it’s like you’re always thinking they’re useless. Whenever you work with them, it’s like you’re mad about having to slow down. Whenever you’re around them, you never seem to take them seriously. S-stuff like... that.”

    “...” A good few seconds’ pause. “I don’t <em>hate</em> humans. Obviously not. It’s just more like... there are some things that humans can’t do. Would you agree?”

    “...” You do notice how he dropped the adjective you had put in front of “humans,” as if he’s implying the two of you aren’t, but you’ll work with him for now. “I... guess? Stuff like magic, or seeing Souls, or reviving after death.”

    “Precisely. So there are certain scenarios that must be handled by an Angel for maximum efficiency, and any humans getting in the way will only make things harder. That’s why the constables stay out of our way during missions: they know they can’t help. They know their place is to keep others away from danger while we fix the problem, then clean up the mess afterwards. There’s nothing wrong with that. It’s just a difference of capabilities. And humans without that training can create even more problems.”

He’s not... wrong, you suppose. But this line of thinking isn’t anything new; he was saying the same things when you first met him! It’s just... now that you’ve seen so much of what Angels can do - and what humans <em>can’t</em> - you’re having just a little bit of a harder time remembering why you objected to his reasoning in the first place. A human cannot purge the corruption. An Angel can, plus they can live for years and years, saving so many humans in the process. Doesn’t that make the Angel objectively more important? That’s what he said way back then, right?

    Something about that logic doesn’t seem quite right to you, but it’s hard to articulate what the problem is.

    “O-okay, but that doesn’t mean we can treat humans badly just because of our status!” Oops, you’ve lumped yourself in with him now. And you’re using just “humans” too, without any adjective. Whatever; you have a point to make. “For example, last year, when we were in the caves, you got mad at some of the workers there just because they were looking at us.”

    “Last year...” He takes a moment to recall. “The ones who were <em>already</em> glaring at us? Hating us just because we’re better off than them, through no fault of our own? And not understanding that we put in a lot of work <em>for their benefit</em>, even though it might <em>look like</em> all we do is lounge around until it’s time to fight the darkness? Those workers?”

    “... Yes.”

    Erich sighs. “Do I really have to explain why I was somewhat curt with them?”

    “Er, n-”

    “I don’t particularly enjoy mucking around in fungus groves all day, and I don’t particularly enjoy being disliked for qualities or misconceptions that I don’t control. And, from what I recall, I didn’t even confront them aside from a brief glare in return. Is that mistreatment?”

No.” He’s right; they were being rude first. You start to doubt yourself; were you really just letting a poor first impression color your thoughts of Erich for years? Is he actually just completely reasonable, if a little driven and occasionally grumpy? Were you even misreading his “obvious” disdain for Serri?

    “Jessamine, it’s getting somewhat late,” Erich says, changing the subject. You have been quiet for a while, just thinking. How long? “Why don’t we dry off, get some food, and then go searching for anything out of place in the sixth district?”

    “Er, y-yeah.” That’s right; you were going corruption-hunting later. “Yeah,” you repeat, more sure of yourself. You can handle this sort of investigation much more readily than nebulous questions about social hierarchy. “I don’t know if I want to find something or not, though.”

    “Hmm... Given that we’re unlikely to be able to deal with anything we do find, I’ll suggest not.”

    “...” That’s right. You’re not full Angels; not yet. You still have a long way to go, even if you’re not helpless anymore. “That makes sense.”

    <em>Scene 129</em>
    ...

    “In this neighborhood? Really?”

    You glare at him briefly. “What’s wrong with this neighborhood?”

    “Nothing! It’s quite peaceful, in fact!”

    “Mmmm... Alright.”

    It’s after dinner now and you’re walking through the alleyways of the sixth district with Erich. You’re careful to stay away from your actual house (how would you explain this to your parents, for one?), but since both prior incidents happened at home or nearby, you’re searching in the same general area. Hence his comments about where you used to live.

    It’s dark already and getting colder by the minute; you’ll be fine for heat a while longer, but you still really hate the dark. The fog is much worse tonight than on Endle Day, making it near-impossible to see even to the end of the block. And you’re not sure if the occasional shivers are from anxiety, the temperature, or... something else.

    “I need to switch to Soul,” you decide, stepping backwards into the pool of light cast by a lonely streetlamp. Its glow forms a halo in the mist. “I can’t see anything focused on Body like this.”

    “Go ahead, but make sure you cover up in case we come across anyone.”

    “Mm hmm.” You pull up your scarf, get confirmation from Erich, and let your disguise drop with some measure of relief. Then, it’s a long half-minute switching over to Soul before you can open your eyes properly, peering around the area for anything out of place.

    “This should be another good opportunity to test the spell,” Erich comments as he sees you start moving around again. “Sense anything out of place?”

    “Hang on...” You shift your awareness, pulsing out in a ring like the three of you had designed. “... Nothing, I think. Let’s walk around a little more and try a few more places, then I want to try Mind.”

    “Ah; you think it may attempt to deceive you again?”

    A shrug. “Maybe. I don’t have a lot of ideas beyond just trying what happened last time again.”

You and Erich wander around the district for a while, trudging through the slushy, freezing, foggy streets and finding a grand total of nothing in particular. Even when you try Mind, there’s no sense of possession or that you’ve managed to purge anything. Just some now-definitely-physical shivers (it’s getting very cold as the evening winds on towards night) and a rising feeling that you’re wasting your time. Eventually, you decide to return to the station.

    But very suddenly, only a block further than you’d been searching previously, you feel something. A chill on your Soul instead of your Body. <em>No way.</em>

    “E-Erich,” you hiss, pulling him back to get his attention. “That way. It’s... something.”

    He crouches next to the wall with you. “What kind of something?”

    “...” You pulse out again, but you’re completely unfamiliar with most types of corruption. “I don’t know, but it’s definitely real. It’s Soul-cold, not - you know! Sh-should we go tell someone?”

    “If we do, is it going to move somewhere else by the time anyone else arrives?”

    “... I don’t know.”

    “Does it feel particularly strong?”

    “... No. I, er, don’t think so, at least.”

    He stands up. “Let’s go take a closer look.”

    You stand there in surprise for a few seconds as Erich confidently walks into the mist, then rush after him, afraid to be left alone in the darkness. “This is not a good idea,” you whisper, using your Soul sense to guide the two of you towards whatever it is anyway. “This is a bad idea, in fact.”

    “Tell me if it notices us or gets stronger. I can’t even feel it yet, so I’m not concerned.”

    “Y-you can’t?”

    “Your Soul must be more sensitive than you thought. But that means whatever we’re approaching is weak. If I can’t sense it, it won’t have enough power to beat us.”

    “... Okay...”

Erich has dropped his disguise at this point as well, attuned to Soul just like you in order to try and sense whatever it is you’re approaching. Finally, as you round yet another corner and enter a very narrow alleyway between two rows of apartments, he looks up with a start.

    “Up there?”

    He’s looking right at it, though it’s clearly inside and isn’t visible physically. You can sense it as a sort of dull ringing, accompanied by a desaturation of the colors nearby. Third floor, second building in the row. You swallow nervously. “Y-yeah. That’s it.”

    “Can you tell anything else now that we’re close?”

    “...” You can, but what you’re sensing is confusing. “I think there are two humans up there with it. One of them is small and kinda bright - like a kid, probably - but the other... I don’t know. They feel...” You struggle to describe it, the ringing in your ears getting worse as the corruption beats intangibly against you even from here. It’s <em>real.</em> And terrifying. “... Grey. Dim. C-cold.”

    Erich turns to you, suddenly even more alert. “Jessamine. We came here potentially expecting a lost Soul. What do you think a possessed human’s Soul looks like?”

    You take another look upstairs. “... Grey.” A pause. “God, Erich; you think it’s possessing some poor kid’s parent?”

    “That’s exactly what I think.” To your increasing horror, he stands up and quickly finds the building’s door. “Come on. We’re saving the day.”

    “B-but - we can’t - we’re not ready-”

    “There’s no time to get a full Angel. It’s weak; we can do this. We can save both people in that apartment. At least, we can if you’re willing to help me do it.”

    <em>Scene 130</em>
    “...” You take his hand and stand up. “Okay.” Confidence. You can do this. It won’t go like your dreams. You... you aren’t dreaming, right? “Let’s go.”

    The building has a lock on the main door, but someone has left it propped open with a rock preventing the latch from closing. Erich leads the way into the dimly lit lobby, still holding your hand as he starts up the stairs. You’re not sure if he’s doing that to make sure you follow, or because he’s scared too.

    “Jessamine,” he whispers. “What do you know about lost Souls? How to destroy them?”

    A flash of anxiety jolts through your Body; <em>that</em> doesn’t make you feel confident at all. “Just... just purge them with Soul energy, right?”

    “Yes, but anything beyond that? What happens if they’re inside of a human? Is it still safe to burn them out?”

    “...” You try to recall. Brother Trigg’s history course had gone over a number of the most common corruption forms found in the city; lost Souls among them. Surely, right? What did he say? You’re too nervous to think properly. “E-erm... I don’t know... I don’t think they’re physical, though, so anything you do like that will only hurt the possessed person...”

    “Can you break the possession?”

    “...” Memories of the course spring up and mix with each other. Brother Trigg talks over himself as you recall him on several different days at once. You’re already on the second floor; you just don’t have enough time! “There... has to be a way, right? It’s linked... Mind, maybe? If I use the purge spell...?”

    “You have to be touching them to do that, right?”

    “No... not <em>technically</em>, but I need a Mental connection, and if I don’t know this person at all... It might be easier to touch them.”

    “If you can purge the Mind, I can purge the Soul. But be careful; stay behind me until we figure out what’s going on in there. Is that okay?”

Easy! <em>Get a grip; calm down.</em> You begin the process of switching to Mind so you’ll be ready when the time comes. It’s still not instant, like when you faced the betrayer twice before. What’s the trigger? You <em>feel</em> like you’re in real peril here, so is it Naoriel? Thinking about it distracts you somewhat from the situation, calming you ever so slightly. Unfortunately, that only lasts a few seconds before you arrive at the door.

    “It’s open...” Erich breathes, pulling you closer so you can both crouch and peek in through the crack.

    It’s a small, messy apartment; you can see the main room and kitchen from here. Two half-opened doors lead to other darkened rooms, probably a bathroom and bedroom. The kid you sensed from downstairs is in the main room, bundled in a blanket and staring vacantly at a workbook you recognize as holding math problems. He looks to be much younger than you - maybe around seven? - and seems nervous, glancing over to the kitchen every few seconds.

    In the kitchen, a tall woman stands with her back to you, clearly making some sort of food on the stove. Even without attunement to Body, you can tell her movements are unnaturally stiff. Assorted minor burns and cuts are visible on her arms above a pair of thick work gloves. You can hear the occasional <em>thock</em> of a knife striking a cutting board; the kid flinches every so often.

    “That’s... that’s what the gloved people on Endle Day looked like!” you hiss, somehow deciding to focus on that instead of <em>anything else</em> going on. “Same sort of outfit!”

    Erich mostly ignores you, scanning the room with his Soul sight. “She’s definitely corrupted, but I think he’s okay for now.” A pause; he considers the darkened rooms. “... But where’s the father?”

    Your back itches and you quickly turn to make sure no one’s creeping up on you. The stairway is empty. “Maybe they don’t have one. Or maybe he’s just at work, or out somewhere, or - I don’t know!”

    “I’m on Mind right now,” you finish. There’s nothing obviously unusual in the bedroom you can spot from here, but Mind doesn’t have the same sort of “vision” as Soul does.

    “Correct. Maybe there’s time to switch?”

    “It’ll take me a whole minute to switch and switch back,” you warn. “Do we have time?”

    “She’s not doing - ah.”

    As you’re whispering, the woman suddenly straightens up and turns. Stares at the door. The kid retreats into his blanket.

    “Erich, what do we do she’s looking right at us?”

    In answer, he stands up and shoves the door open, igniting his Angelic glow. Everyone’s surprised by that - including the woman - allowing him to rush into the main room (dragging you along) and get almost to the kitchen before anyone can react. “Break the possession!” he shouts, finally releasing your hand and continuing forward to - to... what <em>is</em> he doing?!

    The woman snatches two large knives from the cutting board as Erich gets close; he changes course and leaps past her onto the counter, knocking an assortment of dishes onto the floor. The enormous crashing racket - and his acrobatics - distract the woman from you (still standing stunned in the main room) and she chases after him, uncoordinatedly waving the knives.

    “Jessamine!” he shouts again, snatching a baking sheet with which to defend himself. “Hurry!”

You’ve got to - to help him! God, what are you supposed to do? You need to use the Mind purge spell to break the possession, but you’ve never tried that on an unwilling target (much less one that might try to stab you!) If - if you could just get a <em>connection</em>, you could do it from here, but... the woman’s Mind feels all wrong. Crumbly, almost <em>slippery.</em> You can’t get ahold of it, and you can’t feel a connection. Even the basic ones like “human” or “female” - nothing. Which is what you said earlier, and is what you were afraid of. A physical connection will definitely (probably) work, but you’ll have to get up close, and - and-

    One of the knives skates off Erich’s baking sheet with an unpleasant grinding noise. He’s already bleeding from a different cut on his leg; you hadn’t even noticed when it happened. Your breathing quickens again as you imagine the horrible pain of one of those knives sliding right into your chest. The sensation is already familiar from nightmares, but in reality... it would be so much worse, you’re sure of it. You ha-have to move. Just run forward. Be quick!

    You can do it. You’ll be okay.

    You can’t do it. You’re too scared.

    “Jessamine!!”

    <em>Scene 131</em>
    You run forward. She’s not even looking. You’re fast. It’ll be fine; you’ll be okay. Erich sidesteps on the counter, feinting with the baking sheet to keep her attention. You focus through the fear, bringing your Mental connection with the woman to the front of your Mind. Wrap your hands around one arm, using your Angelic strength to hold her back as she starts to turn to face you. Focus; connect. <em>Purge.</em>

    At last, you feel something. And the very instant that connection forms, you dump an enormous amount of your Soul energy into the spell. There’s a sudden flare of light, a blast of heat like you just opened an oven, and a raw-throated scream that cuts off as quickly as it begins. The woman collapses, skin steaming from your power. Did you overdo it?

    “Is-is she-”

    Something oily-dark emerges from the woman’s chest as if clambering out of a deep pit. You take several steps back, wide-eyed, as the thing unfurls to its full height. Its head brushes the ceiling.

    The lost Soul is humanoid, but absolutely not human. Its mostly-opaque form is distended, with its torso and limbs shrunken to put more focus on its swollen, bruised head. Bulging like an overripe fruit. Its neck twists a dozen times like a screw, folds of ghostly flesh twitching as it moves. Its eyes are glassy white and leaking a dull silvery liquid that evaporates as soon as it touches the floor. The monster reaches towards you and lets out a rattling exhale, dribbling dots of the same liquid onto the floor. Then, as its non-eyes swivel to track you, the exhale transitions to a moan, then a ghastly howl. It takes a step towards you, then speeds up.

    You scream. “ERICH!”

It’s slightly translucent, but in the moment all you can make out is his glow somewhere behind. There’s a crash as a baking sheet flies harmlessly through the thing’s head, briefly distorting its shape, then a crackling <em>ZAP</em> as Erich shoves his hands into its back.

    The Soul stumbles forward several steps, screeching, but it isn’t dead (re-dead?). And now it’s upon you. Utter, bone-numbing cold engulfs you as the thing latches onto your shoulders, burning away from its back but salivating and gnashing its horrid, wilted teeth in your face. Its hands steam as your aura burns them, but it’s devouring your energy so... quickly...

    Erich yells something from behind the creature, but you’re too dizzy to understand him. It feels like you’re underwater, watching the surface slowly recede into a long, dark tunnel. Weakly, you raise your hands and try to pry the thing off. Its wrists burn at your touch, but it just digs into your shoulders more painfully, pressing clawlike digits in like numbing icicles. You... just don’t have the energy left.

    Another flare of light pulses behind the thing; its head swells and strains, about to burst, but... not... quite. Instead, part of the flare burns along the Soul’s arms and hands, pushing into your Body and adding a contradictory fiery pain to the horrible cold already present. Its claws pierce deeper, moving towards your neck...

    But that light brings you to your senses, dispelling some of the numbing cold. You realize you’re lying on the floor, half-restrained by the ghostly figure. Erich is behind it, by your legs, pushing even more energy into its shoulder blades. The Soul is half burned away by now, with its legs completely gone and torso nearly so; all that remains is the bulging head and the arms pinning you down.

    You raise your hands, trembling with exertion. Grab hold of the thing’s rotten nose and face. And release what remains of your Soul energy into its head.

    A moment later, it’s over. You’re covered in dots of black, tar-like goop. The lost Soul is gone, dispersed into fragments by your power and returned to wherever it is that Souls go when they disappear. You try to sit up, but you’re too dizzy and your arms don’t work properly.

    “-amine. Look at me. Are you awake?”

    “... Yeah...”

    “Can you move? Are you hurt?”

    “...” You consider the questions. The dizziness is starting to fade already, but the numbness in your shoulders is giving way to a sensation you definitely don’t prefer. “Help me up?”

    It takes a moment for Erich to understand that your arms don’t work, but eventually he helps you into a sitting position with an arm behind your back. With your permission, he pulls your sweater aside a little to reveal streaks of dull, cold grey on your shoulder. Little pinpricks of blood are welling out of the grey skin, staining your sleeve. Neither of you know enough about the injury to tell if that’s seriously bad or just regular bad.

    You start to get dizzy again, so you reluctantly lie down as Erich checks on the woman and the kid emerges from his blanket again. Focus on your breathing. Don’t pass out. Don’t throw up. You are an Angel. You heal really quickly. Just a few minutes and you’ll be okay.

    You hear the woman wake up and Erich explaining what happened. The kid’s relieved sobbing that his mom is okay again. God, you wish you could participate in the conversation.

    Erich looks in the bedroom.

    You hear some thumping and muttering, then a hushed discussion with the woman. You’re so curious. You can get up now, right? You’re okay? You open your eyes and, with a massive effort, manage to sit up under your own power. Your shoulders ache with dull, frigid pain and your arms and hands tingle, but you can move and the dizziness has gone away again. Mostly.

    “I’m just regular injured,” you tell him. “Not <em>that</em> badly. What... do we do next?”

    He looks at you for a moment, deciding whether to believe you. Then, a hushed whisper. “One of the neighbors has gone to get the constables, so we should have a full Angel here within the half-hour. But... there’s something I don’t understand in the bedroom and it seems to be fading quickly. I don’t think you should be using any more magic in your condition, but...”

    <em>Scene 132</em>
    You nod upwards. “Help me up. I’ll go look.” Of course, <em>now</em> you find your courage. <em>After</em> the fighting is done.

    A moment of hesitation, but he does help you up. “Don’t get too close to it. I don’t want anything else happening to you.”

    You feel a brief twinge of annoyance, even though he’s probably only trying to keep you safe. Why did the Soul only focus on you? Why does he get to be totally fine after that fight? A pause; you notice his uneven gait. He’s bleeding from several cuts, though it’s already slowing down. A bit of guilt mixes with the annoyance as he’s clearly <em>not</em> totally fine. You just go with “Okay.” Then, “Sorry it took so long to do the purge.”

    “It’s fine. I... also must apologize for failing to get it off of you.”

    Both of you say nothing for a moment. Then, you decide on “It was our first monster. I think we both did great, really. No one died and we got rid of it.”

    “I suppose one can’t ask for more.”

    Erich opens the bedroom door and quickly ushers you inside, closing it behind and making sure that the kid isn’t looking. You can very quickly see why. “What... <em>is</em> this?”

    “I told you: I don’t know.”

    The room is small and messy, but the centerpiece is definitely on the unmade bed, sheets tangled as if someone had a very restless night. There’s a depression formed in the middle, like a bowl made of blankets, and inside it is... well, you’re not sure. It’s a dark liquid substance: oily with a rainbow sheen, but glittering with a sort of silvery reflectiveness. It’s slowly moving of its own accord, churning like an invisible chef is stirring it. Though you certainly wouldn’t want to eat any such dish; you can feel the hatred pouring out of it. The liquid is <em>heavily</em> corrupted, to the point where you doubt you could approach too closely even if you wanted to.

    “Watch it for a minute. The level is lowering.”

    You watch it for a minute. The level lowers. “Where’s it going? Is it just leaking out? Blankets aren’t watertight; did you check the floor?”

    “I don’t particularly want to get close either,” he reminds you. “I’m certain you can feel how dangerous that substance is.”

    “... Yeah.” A pause. “Let me try Soul.” This new mystery is already making you forget the lost Soul’s awful appearance and the pain that still lingers in your shoulders. You’re getting a bit excited, because you have just a tiny little inkling what this might be. Yara reminded you of something like it, ages ago by now.

    You attune to Soul (again taking the normal amount of time) and open your eyes. As expected, there’s no warm heat of a human or Angelic Soul: it feels like a block of ice over there. Corrupted. But you’ve gotten better at “looking” since the last time you saw the corruption directly and you have a few new techniques to work with now. “It’s... layered, I think. It’s not all the same thing.”

    “Can you tell what the layers are?”

    “...” You squint through the hatred beating against you and dulling your vision. “It’s hard to tell. I don’t know what any of this is. But there’s... three of them, I think. Or four? And something else mixed in.” A few blinks and suddenly that last thing becomes more clear for a moment before fading again. “It’s silver. The mixed-in thing is silver; I know it.”

    “The metal or the color?”

    “The color. But it feels... really, really bad.” A pause. “Did you notice that Soul had silver eyes?”

    “... Do you think it’s related?”

    “This may be a little too pedantic, but I believe the Soul’s eyes were white. It was <em>crying</em> silver, but its eyes were not silver.”

    “Ah! I think...” You try to remember, but the main feature seared into your Mind is its teeth. “I think you’re right. I wonder how it’s - Erich, the liquid!”

    It’s gone, and with it, so too is the corruption. Some lingers in the air like a bad smell, but the overwhelming hatred has disappeared. You can breathe more easily again, and the twist in your stomach you hadn’t even realized was there is now actually gone. Now you can really focus on how much your arms hurt!

    “Faded away. What <em>was</em> it?”

    You hurry over to the bed, despite his protests, and take a look. “Nothing here. It doesn’t even look wet, see?” You brush your hand across the blankets right where it had been. “Nothi... oh... oh no-”

    “Jessamine?”

    “Oh that was so stupid. Hold on.” You stumble away from the bed and sit down against the wall, churning with acute nausea. Your hand feels like it’s immersed in boiling water. Or freezing?

    “What’s happened? I <em>told</em> you to stay away from it!” He kneels beside you, but there’s not much he can do.

    “It’s-” You hold a shallow breath, desperately not wanting to throw up on Erich. “There’s some - something left.” A pause. Your hand is turning grey and little pinpricks of blood are welling out, just like your shoulders. At least the nausea is receding. “Ohhh, why did I do thaaat?”

    Erich doesn’t have any answers for you. “Jessamine, <em>please</em> be more careful. That’s twice in one day.”

    He doesn’t have any answers to that either.

    It only takes another minute or so before you feel strong enough to stand up and leave the bedroom. You tell the woman that whatever was in there isn’t anymore, but she definitely shouldn’t go in until a full Angel has cleared it. She seems to think you’ve destroyed it, given the new injury on your hand, and you don’t explain how you really got hurt. It’s probably better that way. Certainly less embarrassing.

    Finally, the requested full Angel shows up. Neither of you know him, but from your brief interactions he seems pretty laid-back. He clears out the bedroom, informing the woman that he’s going to have to destroy the bedding but the rest is now clean, tends to everyone’s wounds, and even stops the bleeding from your grey skin. Apparently the grey itself will go away on its own overnight as your Body recovers its connection to your Mind. Yes, it seems that’s what happened: portions of your Body were forcibly ripped away from your Mind, leaving them confused, directionless, and dying.

    That’s probably fine.

    <em>Scene 133</em>
    You don’t talk much on the way back; both of you are exhausted and have plenty to think about on your own. But towards the end of the journey, when the train starts slowing down to navigate the tighter turns near downtown, Erich eventually speaks.

    “I’m glad we actually found something, despite... everything that happened.” It almost seems like he’s about to continue, but he doesn’t.

    “... Yeah. We really did it, huh? Saved the day like real Angels. Even though it was maybe a <em>little</em> harder than expected.”

    “Concerns for the future, I suppose.”

    “...” A longer pause. “I think I know what the liquid is.”

    “Really?”

    “Well, it’s a guess. But... you know the spawning pools?”

    “Of course.”

    “I think that liquid is something like that. I mean, think about it: why are there so many lost Souls in the sixth district? How do they keep showing up? Maybe because they were being spawned from little pools like that one in the bedroom?”

    Erich considers this idea. “Lost Souls aren’t spawned from pools. They’re <em>Souls</em> - human Souls - that have been corrupted. The corruption can’t create Souls directly from the pools.”

    “...” Whoops. “R-right, but it could have been spawning other darkness creatures that could have corrupted all the Souls. It doesn’t need to be direct, but it’s just so weird why there have been so many problems in the district. Every time I go back there, I find another one! So... I mean, it’s liquid, it’s in a pool, it’s corrupt, it fits the data... you know? It just makes sense!”

    Another pause. “We’ve never seen spawning pools in the city before.”

At least, not close-up. We really have no idea how they work at all, and we know the corruption evolves over time. Shades never appeared before Erejil, for one, and that sort of thing has happened more than once. Maybe now, spawning pools can move. Or can be smaller, or - I don’t know. The rules can change.”

    “... Jessamine, I truly hope you’re wrong.”

    “Yeah. Me too.” What else is there to say? Spawning pools appearing in the city would be unbelievably bad, for pretty obvious reasons. Right now, Angels can prevent all but the craftiest shades from getting into Nucarreo, but if new corruption can simply <em>appear</em> inside the walls... it would very quickly become impossible to manage. Angels usually aren’t capable of detecting corruption from very far away - Erich had to be on the same block to sense the Soul tonight, for example - so entire districts could become infested without anyone even noticing. Such as, for an anxiety-inducing example, the sixth.

    But what can you do about it? You can’t even touch the stuff without your hand just about falling off (it’s still achey and tingly, but at least that’s it) - let alone figure out how to destroy it or prevent it from entering at all! You just don’t know enough. No one does.

    Your dreams tonight are certainly going to be intense.

    ...

    Despite the late hour, you and Erich are ushered over to Oth Hall to meet with Brother Cobb upon your return. There’s a silent, intimidating man in a bishop’s coat standing in the corner; you start to wonder if you’re in trouble.

You’re both chastised for risking your lives by hunting down corruption you aren’t ready for, but after a little bit of not-quite-lying about how much was your idea to go hunting and how much was just spotting someone in danger and trying to help them, there’s not much they can actually berate you about. You manage to get out of the room with only a warning to be more careful next time and to call for backup if at all possible.

    But you aren’t about to leave without telling someone more important than you about your spawning pool idea. Cobb and the bishop listen without interruption as you detail the evidence - Erich backs you up as well, even though he was just doubting you half an hour ago.

    Fortunately (or unfortunately?) Cobb and the bishop seem to take your report seriously. That’s good, since someone will probably do something about it, but very bad because that means there’s a chance you might actually be right.

    After all that, you part ways with Erich for the first time since the morning, clean up as best you can (your outfit is totally covered in that tarry goop from the Soul; you don’t have much hope for it, but maybe the laundry service can work a miracle) and finally crawl into bed... to lie there staring at the ceiling instead of sleeping. You’ve gotten pretty familiar with the ceiling by now, after all these sleepless nights. It’s not as pure white as you might think; there’s texture to see if you know where to look.

    Hm, that almost sounds like you’re making some metaphorical statement about Angels or the Cathedra, but really you were just remarking on the ceiling. Promise.

Instead, you distract yourself by wondering about your own behavior. You were, to be honest, a little airheaded today. Falling down that icy passage and touching the corrupted blankets were just the standout examples; you also had trouble holding back improper questions, you were weird on the train, and you had some unusual thoughts about Angels and humanity. It’s like you were distracted the whole day.

    And, well, you were. You were nervous about the whole “is this a date?” thing before the lost Soul appeared, and obviously you were distracted by it after it did. In fact, that date question never got an answer. You didn’t ask him and it’s not like there was <em>actual</em> evidence one way or the other. Him acting weird on the train doesn’t really count; after all, you did that too!

    ... You probably need to calm down, focus, and really figure out if you like Erich or not. As a friend... probably? He’s not nearly as annoying as you had thought and you did have fun today (at least until the lost Soul incident, which kind of overshadowed everything before). But... <em>like</em> like...?

    Back under the blankets; you flip over and squeeze the pillow as you consider the idea. But... no; you’re smarter than this. You’re way too confused, exhausted, and emotionally drained right now to come to any reasonable conclusion. You emphatically decide to think no more of this tonight. Instead, you will go to sleep.

    “...”

    Yeah, it’s great to <em>say</em> that (think that), but...

    It sure would be great if there were a spell that could just knock you out. Maybe there is. You’ve got to ask Sister Noll about that later; it seems like a Mind thing.

    ... mmmaybe you’ll put that off a little longer. You just woke up, after all; there’s no need to rush.

    Maybe a little longer still; after all, it’s the festival and you can’t expect to get any solid thinking done with all these distractions.

    <em>Scene 134</em>
    “Ah, the hero returns!”

    “Oh no, not you too.”

    You flop down in a chair near Yara’s as he carefully bookmarks and then closes his reading material. “Gossip spreads quickly, you know. Although of course I’m certain it’s at least somewhat incorrect.”

    “What did you hear?”

    “Oh, nothing much. Just that two trainees managed to hunt down and destroy a lost Soul while they were out for the festival.”

    “That’s... what happened. Among other things.” You rub one shoulder contemplatively; it still aches just a little. Your hands are fine, though. “I can, er, explain? If you want?”

    “Goodness, yes! I was merely obeying my prior commitment to not ask you about it! But if you’re offering...”

    You tell Yara what happened. Of course you were always going to - at least, unless something utterly mortifying needed to be redacted - but just sticking your hands in the corruption probably isn’t <em>that</em> embarrassing. Seems like something he would have done at some point.

    “Hm! Spawning pools within the city; quite a dangerous idea.”

    “So... you think I’m wrong?”

    “Oh, I wouldn’t be that hasty. The corruption has been acting strangely as of late; shades in particular are being found in the most unusual places. What do you suppose one of those creatures would have been doing in a destroyed cistern from before the year-zero cataclysm?”

    “Er...”

    “According to the group that discovered it, studying something. Old markings on the wall, almost entirely erased by time. Are they becoming interested in ancient languages or culture? Who knows, but the simple fact of a change in behavior has everyone nervous. And your ‘spawning pool’ might fit into that as well.”

    “...”

    “Interesting times, it seems. I’ll see if I can spot any more of that liquid on my patrols. And as usual, I’m sure Stella will be interested.” He shakes his head ruefully. “I never get to give her any good news.”

    “At least we’ve noticed it...?”

    “H-ha, yeah.” Does he suspect? Surely he’d just ask you directly if he did, right?

    “Anyway, beyond even your heroic feats and dangerous discoveries, I do believe you had another purpose in venturing into the cold. I won’t <em>ask</em> if you made any progress, but I certainly wouldn’t decline an answer regardless.”

    “Er - y-yeah. I...” A pause, a breath. You’ve had time to think about it by now. “I think I misjudged Erich before. He’s not a bad guy, really. Just... kind of...” You struggle to come up with the right adjectives. “... Forceful? About certain things? Assertive? I don’t know.” Another pause. “Plus, I don’t think he gets what it’s like to not be rich or an Angel.”

    Several nods. No comments. Unusual, for him.

    “But... I think we can be friends. Or at least friendly.”

    “And that’s all? Not that that’s a bad thing-”

    “I get it. Yeah, that’s all.”

    “Well, congratulations! You went, you learned, and you decided! Can’t go much more smoothly than that!”

    “... Yeah. You’re right.”

    A pause; Yara grins. “Well, aside from falling down a pit, fighting a monster, and then sticking your hands in the corruption! But who’s counting?”

    Who indeed?

The detection spell is essentially completed and distributed to full Angels for testing. You still hang out with Erich every so often even after development is done. You celebrate your 14th birthday and enter your third year of training. Despite the growing uncertainty surrounding shades and spawning pools, your life in particular is going fine. You’re even starting to talk with your instructors about your third year practical, where you’ll spend some time with a constabulary in the city to learn how to work with them. That’s what Emmett and Rhysa were doing when you first Ascended, and now you’ll be able to do the same thing to some other new Angel. At least, if anyone happens to Ascend while you’re away.

    But of course, such a period of calm, ordinary life couldn’t last for long. You haven’t been spending as much time with Naoriel lately - you’ve been busy with Yara and Erich designing the spell. Maybe if you had, you would have noticed sooner. But you didn’t, so she has to tell you.

    “Is it something bad?” you ask hesitantly. She’s pulled you off to some remote corner of the Cathedra campus again, which usually means she wants to talk about something serious. But this time, instead of nervous, she seems more... angry?

    “Yes! Well, sort of. Look...” She checks around the little pavilion area for any prying eyes (or worse, ears).

    You help out with a Soul check; she still can’t cast very powerful or very complicated spells and some instructors are starting to take note. It’s worrying, but neither of you can do anything about it. “No one here.”

    “Jess.” She leans in a little, almost whispering anyway. “My dad figured it out. He knows who the betrayer is.”

    “W-what? That’s great news! Why... why is it not?”

    “Because he won’t tell me!”

    “Ah. W-well, maybe he’s got it under control? After all, that is... his job?”

So clearly he’s missing something that would let this whole thing be over already, but he won’t let me help because he just won’t tell me who it is!”

    “... Y-yeah. That makes sense.” It sort of does; it is kind of strange that the Inquisitors wouldn’t have brought in whoever the betrayer is already, if they know. This person is dangerous and willing to kill - that rock last summer could easily have been the end of someone. Or Naoriel specifically.

    “So. I want to ask you a favor.”

    “...” A brief pause. You have a sinking feeling you know what she’s about to ask. “N-Naoriel; I can’t possibly-”

    “He likes you, and you’re good at Mind magic. Can you - please - go ask him? And if he won’t say... you can read Minds now, right?”

    <em>Scene 135</em>
    “I - I can ask, but there’s no way I’m going to use Mind magic on him.”

    “... Yeah, you’re probably right. That would be... bad. Dad’s good at figuring out when someone’s hiding something from him. I... sorry; I’m just frustrated.”

    “It’s okay...” A pause; you struggle to come up with something useful to say. “I think you’re right to be frustrated. We’ve been trying to figure this out for ages too and the longer they stay out there, the more danger we’re in.”

    “Right? And I’m sure we could <em>help</em> if he’d just let us - bait them out or something - but he’s probably just trying to protect me.”

    “...” Something occurs to you. “We’ve eliminated a lot of Angels as suspects, though. I wonder if maybe we could work out who it is if he just gives us <em>some</em> details, even without the actual name?”

    “Maybe... I doubt he’d let anything slip.”

    Another thing occurs to you. “What if it’s someone we know? And we’d maybe tip them off if we knew, so that’s why he won’t say anything?”

    Naoriel frowns. “Someone we know? It has to be an Archangel, though, since their magic is so strong. And there are so few of them left that haven’t been accounted for in some way... Do you even know any Archangels?”

    “Not... really.” You hesitate; change your Mind. “Actually, I kinda do. There’s an Archangel called Aveline who does healing work; she’s been helping me with my sickness. Is she still on the list?”

    “I don’t have the list with me.”

    “Ah.” An awkward pause. Neither of you particularly want to go get the list. “Well, maybe check it later? Just to be sure? I’m pretty sure it couldn’t possibly be her, but...”

    “Whoever they are, they’re excellent at disguise,” she finishes. “They’ve been hiding from everyone for years at least.”

    “Yeah.”

    “I’ll find who’s left on the list. If you can get anything from my dad, then...”

    “I’ll try.”

The prime of Inquisition isn’t impossible to meet with, though he is understandably quite busy. Possibly chasing down the very person you’re intending to ask about. Given how your last conversation went, you’re definitely a little nervous, but at least it’s not nearly as bad as if you had been intending to use magic on him. You’re pretty sure you would have given it away immediately; you’re just not that good at acting nonchalant. No, your strategy today is similar to the last time: you’re going to tell the truth.

    There are currently fourteen Archangels and three Seraphim in the Cathedra; those are the only Angels who have strong enough magic to be the betrayer. At least, unless a regular Angel is stronger than you expect and you’ve already ruled out the right answer, but you try not to think about that possibility. Of those, all three Seraphim and five of the Archangels have airtight alibis during at least one of the times the betrayer attacked. That leaves nine possible suspects, of which you’ve eliminated three more due to differences in magical ability or signature. Six remain who could be the betrayer. Aveline, uncomfortably, is one of the six.

    But that doesn’t mean she’s guilty! Even if you’re a little uncomfortable around her sometimes, that’s just because seeing her reminds you of your sickness. That’s always why you’re there, or some other Soul problem like Yara’s experiment years ago. So. Five Archangels you don’t know beyond their names and portraits. Hopefully you can get the prime to reveal which one is the betrayer.

    And hopefully it’s not just some random Angel you haven’t considered; that would be very embarrassing.

    “Angel Goodall,” he greets you, looking up from a stack of paperwork as you enter. “Good afternoon. What can I do for you?”

    “I see. Very well.” He taps the wall, just as he did last time. “Seal the room, please. No one listens in, including yourselves.”

    The same pulse of magic. You breathe out. “It’s about...” Oh, it’s still hard to say it even if you know you won’t be overheard. In fact, change of plans. You’re not going to mention her if you can get away with it. “... the betrayer Angel.”

    “The one who dropped a rock on Naoriel?”

    “... Yes.” Well, just because <em>you</em> didn’t bring her up...

    “What about them?”

    “I j-just wanted to know if... you’ve made any progress...? S-since I’ve been attacked a few times, and it’s kind of... d-danger...ous...” You kind of trail off as the prime looks at you.

    “Naoriel put you up to this, didn’t she?”

    “...” You swallow nervously. “Yes...”

    An unexpected laugh. “Ha! Clever, but she’d have better luck with someone I’m keeping fewer eyes on.”

    “E-eyes...?”

    “You want to know the betrayer’s identity. And just what would you plan on doing with that information, should I tell you?”

    “W-we thought that maybe... we could help you catch them? Since...” A hesitation, then you blurt out the next part quickly. “Since if you already know who it is, then you should have arrested them already if you could, but since you haven’t you clearly can’t and maybe we could help?”

    “It would look that way, I suppose.” A nod and a sigh. “Jessamine, I’ll be quite frank with you. I can’t tell Naoriel because learning the betrayer’s identity would hurt her. And I can’t tell <em>you</em> because you would immediately tell Naoriel.”

    “...” Well, he’s not wrong. “Why would it hurt her?”

    “Let’s change the topic slightly. If, as you say, I cannot arrest the betrayer right now, why would that be? I have direct, corroborated evidence of at least one attempted murder, and I know their identity. Why would I not simply make a move?”

    <em>Scene 136</em>
    “...” You take a few moments to think about it, but really the answer seems obvious. “They’d reveal... why they’re targeting Naoriel.”

    “Good. You have been paying attention. It’s certain they would be in trouble for their methods regardless, but Naoriel would still be executed.”

    Hearing him state it so plainly is kind of a shock. Yeah, you knew she was in danger, but...

    “So the challenge is determining how to proceed without giving the betrayer a chance to share their information.”

    “...” You pretty quickly thought of at least one way. “Er... I know it’s a little ruthless, but... c-could you just...” Trying to get the words “kill them?” out is difficult; even for someone like that, to purposefully kill anyone, let alone an Angel...

    Luckily, Mr Fisher seems to understand. “If you’re referring to killing the betrayer, that’s unlikely to work either. My Inquisitors could likely do so, but only if pushed into a battle. If the betrayer simply surrenders, we wouldn’t be able to attack. And even if a fight does break out and they are killed, they’re an Angel. They have a Second Chance. Only if they then attempt to fight <em>again</em> could we potentially finish the job, as it were. Too unlikely to work, even if everything goes well.”

    “...” Secretly, you’re a little relieved. Angels fighting Angels shouldn’t happen (at least, not outside of training). Not since Erejil. “So... if that won’t work, and arresting them won’t either, and we can’t just <em>leave</em> them like this...?”

    “You see the problem. There are of course other ways, such as poisoning, ambushes, traps, or sabotage in the wastes, but we aren’t assassins. There are limits to how far our methods can - or should - go. At the end of the day, it seems likely that the betrayer will have time to say what they intend to say after their arrest. I can’t see another plausible path.”

    “... So it’s hopeless?”

It may be possible to convince the betrayer to stay quiet once captured, or even to arrange a deal to cease her attacks. Trying to make contact is a delicate matter, of course, but certainly possible for us. So just give us a little more time to work; you might be surprised at how things turn out.”

    “...Her?”

    “...” Mr Fisher winces. “Hell. Ah, Naoriel will be pleased with you. I assume you already have a list of some sort, and I’ve just cut it in half?”

    “M-more than half,” you admit. “We’re... er, down to... two, now.” Three of the remaining five Archangels had been male. The only two left now are Aveline and an Archangel you don’t know named Kamiya.

    <em>“Two?”</em> the prime exclaims, standing up with a start. You jolt in your chair. “Out of the entire Cathedra?”

    You nod nervously.

    “How did you-” A pause. “Who are the two?”

    You show him the list.

    “Now, you know I can’t confirm or deny your selection. But how did you narrow this down?”

    “W-well, they needed to be an Archangel or Seraph because of the powerful magic from the last attack... and some of them had alibis... and then we tried to find out who could or couldn’t have cast the spells we saw... and... er, that’s... about it. U-until you, er, said... ‘her.’”

    “...”

    You stay quiet too. You don’t know what to say.

    “You two must have been busy. Perhaps too busy for your own good. Tell me, how did you determine that only Archangels and Seraphs have powerful enough magic to cast the spells in question? Magical proficiency is not directly tied to rank, even though Archangels tend to be more experienced.”

And the number of transmutation d-domains they must know to do all that and the other attacks...” You’re getting really nervous with how intense his gaze is getting; it’s getting hard not to just trail off. “... there’s... never been any non-Archangel who’s been recorded d-doing all that.”

    “Er, pardon me?”

    “When you find the betrayer. Whether they are in your final two or not, clearly you don’t intend to stop until you figure it out. What will you do then?”

    <em>Scene 137</em>
    Unfortunately, you don’t have much of a plan to share. The original idea had always been to just find the betrayer and then everything would be fine. After all, what they’re doing is terrible and illegal; they would be arrested and that would be that. But, when you really think about it, this problem had been there from the start. If the betrayer is targeting Naoriel because they know her secret, then if anything happens, they can always just reveal it. In fact, the only reason she’s still here right now is that the betrayer simply hasn’t done so yet.

    You feel so helpless. “I... don’t know. There’s no good option.”

    “I see.” You think he sounds disappointed, though his expression hasn’t changed. “Then please, just stay out of this. Let me handle it.”

    “...” He doesn’t have much of a plan either; he admitted that just a minute ago. But, if you don’t have any better ideas... “Okay...”

    “Good. Then, is there anything else?”

    There isn’t. You’re ushered out of his office; one of the Inquisitors standing outside enters as you leave. Presumably to hear the prime’s account of what you discussed, though obviously he’ll be redacting some details. You assume.

    So, back to Naoriel.

    But as you walk, you start to wonder. Mr Fisher is the head of Inquisition. He’s experienced with interrogations and he leads probably the most powerful group within the Cathedra. Would a man like that <em>really</em> have accidentally let slip the betrayer’s gender? Or did he do it on purpose? Was it a lie, just to mislead you? Is the betrayer actually a man, like their disguises have been? Or was it the truth, and he was giving you real information for some reason? Why?
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1262108972656230490 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1262108972656230490><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, July 14, 2024 2:10 PM">2:10 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Well, there’s really only two cases: truth or lie (discounting the possibilities that he actually just slipped up or doesn’t know, for now). If you assume he was telling the truth, then he must have wanted you to have that information. And that means he must want you to find the betrayer. And... do what? You don’t have a plan either! No one was listening, so if he wanted you to do something, he could have just told you directly! Maybe it’s a plausible deniability kind of thing, where if you get arrested, at least he didn’t directly tell you? But if Naoriel is revealed as a half-Angel, Mr Fisher is definitely going to be arrested too, no matter what you say. So that doesn’t make sense either!

    But if he was lying... you can think of at least one reason to do that: to stop you from finding the betrayer and putting yourself or Naoriel in even more danger. You can see the rationale from his point of view, but you’re already in danger just from the betrayer being around. How much worse would it be if you knew who they were? If you did something about it? But what could you even do? That doesn’t really make sense... does it?

    Ugh; all these motivations and possibilities whirl around in your Mind. None of them seem to make sense, though some are more nonsensical than others. Maybe Naoriel has some ideas.

    “Let’s change her memories.”

    Well, that’s not what you were expecting. “Change... memories?”

    “The problem is that, if we arrest her, she’s going to tell them everything. Right? So let’s just make it so she doesn’t have anything bad to say!”

    “...” Naoriel seems to understand your concern without you having to articulate it.

    “Okay, I get it. But let’s go step by step. One: Mind magic can change someone’s memories. Yes or no?”

    “... Yes. But only through-”

    “Hold on; just yes or no for now! Two: you know how to do that. Yes or no?”

    “No!”

    “Right. So three: memory <em>erasure</em> is easier to do.”

    “... Yes.”

    “Yeah.”

    “Five: we definitely wouldn’t be able to do that by attacking directly.”

    “Yes! Er, no? That - that’s right.”

    “So, six: if we know who the betrayer is and can recruit someone with good Mind magic, we can change her memories sneakily, and then it’d be fine to arrest her!”

    “... That’s a lot of ‘ifs.’ Plus, it sounds kind of... unethical?”

    “She’s trying to kill me! And my dad!”

    “Y-yeah, that’s right. Erm, okay, but... memory manipulation is really tricky, and the target basically has to be willing or completely restrained for it to work. The process is really delicate. And it’s transmutation, so there’s no way I could do it anytime soon. Even erasure - which is projection, so I could <em>maybe</em> learn it in a year or two - is really hard and has the same problems.”

    “That’s why we figure out who she is and, I don’t know, sneak in while she’s sleeping.”

    “... This isn’t sounding any more ethical the more details you add.”

    “Is it any <em>more</em> ethical to leave her alone so she can keep attacking me and maybe even start hurting other people as collateral damage?”

    “P-probably not?”

    “And do you have any better ideas?”

    “... No.” You really don’t. But the idea of manipulating someone’s Mind like this makes you very uncomfortable. The Mind isn’t as sacred as the Soul, and memory changes like this are sometimes reverted over years as the Soul slowly overwrites the edits, but... it still feels wrong to go poking around inside someone’s head like that. You were uncomfortable enough with just Mind reading, and that-

    Oh. You just had an idea.

    “Er, I don’t know if I can help with the changing, but I just thought... if you think he was telling the truth, and we only have two possibilities... I could <em>maybe</em> try Mind reading? L-like, if you ‘coincidentally’ walk by, maybe the betrayer will think about you?”

    “Would you? Can you? Is that dangerous, though? Could they detect you?”

But if they know I’m in their Mind, they can definitely suppress their thoughts or just kick me out...”

    “You said distracted? What about...”

    You spend a lot of time talking about this. An hour at least, plus several more over the next few days. Not just the plan to Mind-read these <em>Archangels</em>, but also to find someone trustworthy who can do Mind transmutation magic, or for you to somehow learn it yourself. You haven’t explicitly agreed to do any of this yet, of course, but the longer the planning goes on, the more you feel like you have implicitly. And that makes you extremely nervous, because if you get caught trying to sneak into an Archangel’s head...

    Maybe you should just back out. An Inquisitor could definitely do the memory manipulation, if they wanted, but... you don’t know if Mr Fisher would agree to do that. Or if the Inquisitor would. “There are limits to how far our methods should go,” he said. Or something like that. Would editing the Mind of an Archangel be too far? You feel like it probably is, even as you contemplate doing exactly that yourself. What a hypocritical sinner you are. Or at least a sinner-to-be.

    But what other option is there?

    Well, every plan always has at least one alternative, and that’s procrastination. As days and then weeks go by, you get less confident and more worried as additional details come up. You continue to work with Noll on how to detect meddlers in your Mind - both for actual reasons and to find out how to hide if you yourself are the meddler - and are concerned that it really does seem easy unless you’re up against a true master of subtlety.

    When you’re reading someone else’s Mind, your Soul (attuned to Mind) is touching it. That’s how magic works, of course. That’s fine if you’re trying to hide from ordinary humans, because they usually can’t sense Souls at all, but for an Angel to miss such a direct touch would be implausible. This concept is one of the main reasons why everyone’s so sure you weren’t possessed by a lost Soul that one time, and why you think the Mind manipulation then was due to corruption exposure instead.

    If the Angel isn’t attuned to Soul or Mind, it’s harder for them to notice - especially with your Soul in the Mind aspect instead of its native one - but it’s still pretty obvious as your thoughts inevitably mix to some small degree with the ones you’re trying to read. This isn’t usually an issue if you’re doing this consensually, as you can filter out your own thoughts near-unconsciously after some practice, but it’s a big problem for being sneaky.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1265080836710207599 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1265080836710207599><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, July 22, 2024 6:59 PM">6:59 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The best literature on this practice still isn’t very good, as the need for Angels to hide from Angels is usually nonexistent, but there have been some studies for various purposes - usually relating to detecting shades that can use magic. And those studies tend to say that you should try to attune your thoughts to the target as best you can, so they feel more similar and are easier to pass as the target’s own. Which kind of leads back to the first problem you ran into way back at the start: it’s much easier to use Mind magic on someone if you know them well. And although you interact with Aveline on a somewhat frequent basis, you wouldn’t say you know her <em>well.</em> Not to mention you’ve never even seen Kamiya.

    Anyway, the point is that you probably won’t be able to pull off even the Mind reading, let alone the Mind manipulation that’s your current best (still very bad) plan to deal with this whole situation. So, uneasily, you just kind of don’t do anything. It’s not giving up; you’re just waiting for a better chance. When? <em>...Sometime.</em> Probably. You feel bad not being able to help, but at least Naoriel agrees that it would be a really bad idea to go for it without being extremely, fully confident in success. If you choose the wrong person and get detected, you’ll get in big trouble. But if you choose the <em>right</em> person and get detected...

    So, yeah. Instead, you start to focus on preparing for your third year practical.

    Not that there’s all that much to prepare, really. You don’t have to demonstrate anything or take a test or whatever; you’re simply assumed to be ready for this by now. And you sort of feel like you are? After destroying that lost Soul with Erich, you’ve felt more confident in yourself (at least in some ways). Despite the horror, you <em>did</em> it. And you’ll always be better prepared now (and in the future) than you were then.

Yes, you’ll be working in your official capacity for the practical, so you get to keep your true Angelic appearance. It’s not the first time you’ve been outside the Cathedra like that, but it’ll certainly be the longest and most public.

    You’re told that the hosting constabulary gets to choose what you’ll be working on, though you (as an Angel) have as much authority as you want to veto whatever they want you to do. The administrative person working with you on this cautions you against using that veto too often - the constables don’t really like being ordered around by a 14 year old girl - but if you feel uncomfortable or anything, to just say no.

    You ask what sort of things they might have you do, and receive a fairly generic answer. “Basically whatever isn’t likely to get you hurt” seems to be the gist of it, varying from normal patrols or handling lesser offenses to helping track corruption or investigate the aftermath of such an attack. It does seem more likely that you’ll be dealing with corruption and adjacent activities, for hopefully obvious reasons, but it seems very possible you’ll be issuing someone a citation for parking a carriage in the wrong spot. The image of that strikes you as incredibly funny, but probably not for the person receiving the ticket.

    One other change from prior outings is that you’ll be on your own this time. Not completely - you’ll be surrounded by constables during the day - but there won’t be any other Angels around unless they’re called out to deal with corruption in your constabulary’s district. Well, you’ve been alone before. You’ll be fine.

It’ll only be for a few weeks, but you won’t be living at the Cathedra, your parents’ house, or in the constabulary (there’s nowhere to sleep there, unless you want to live in a jail cell). Instead, you’ll get a nearby apartment and be expected to basically just take care of yourself before reporting to work in the morning and after leaving at night. Which apparently means there’s absolutely nothing to stop you from going out into the city during the evenings aside from being told not to unless you’re disguised. Which is fine; you can do that.

    What you’d <em>do</em> in the city at night is another matter; maybe you should just stay in the apartment. You’re certainly fairly capable and far stronger than you look, but the idea of getting into trouble and having to fight someone or reveal your Angelic appearance sounds like a very bad one. It would <em>probably</em> be fine. The streets are <em>pretty</em> safe. Mostly, likely. There’s always the risk.

    Still, it’s something you’ve never had the chance to do before, and probably won’t have the chance again until you graduate. How daring are you feeling?

    <em>Scene 139</em>
    Pretty daring, as it turns out. You’ve grown a lot over the past two-and-a-bit years.

    Time moves quickly and before long it’s the first day of the practical. You’re taken directly to the constabulary while some porter or monk or whatever takes your stuff to the apartment. And then, you spend the day learning about the wonders of paperwork. It seems the constables are almost married to the stuff; everything needs a report or a form or at least a memo.

    Your first task is correlation. You’re given a stack of incident reports and a mentor constable experienced in this sort of thing, then asked to find patterns. Are these incidents actually related? If so, how? The same perpetrator? Locations? Victims? Is the corruption involved? How much effort should we put into investigating? What additional data would be helpful, if you can’t decide based on what you currently have? That sort of thing.

    It’s not boring work - at least, not in your opinion - you find yourself getting pretty absorbed in maps and charts and lists upon lists upon lists. In the latter half of the day, you draw a few conclusions and point out a few estimates for where might be good locations to survey for more information, and that’s that. Someone, presumably, will be dispatched to investigate your hunches. Maybe even you! But not today.

    You didn’t really talk to many constables outside of the captain and the mentor he assigned you, but your location near the middle of the open office led to you overhearing a lot of conversations. There’s a lot more going on every day than you thought, and so many more incidents than Angels hear about. Most of it is mundane, everyday stuff like parking violations, event planning, disorder complaints, and the like, but not all. Constables are really busy. It’s no wonder the precinct offices are so huge; with all the <em>stuff</em> that happens in the district every day, it’s more of a wonder why they aren’t huge-r!

It’d be tough to hide given that you’re wearing an Angel uniform anyway. But you’re not alone yet, and probably for good reason. A small group of constables shields you from prying eyes as you quickly head to the apartment building while people on the street watch. Or, in some cases, beg.

    “-Miss Angel, Bless my husband! PLEASE! PLEASE-”

    “-just a moment of youR TIME WAIT-”

    “-are we going to do, Miss Angel, about the-”

    “-need your help to-”

    “...” That last man just stares at you pitifully, unable to speak. He has no lips or teeth. You... try not to think about how that could have happened. You can’t help him anyway.

    And then you’re delivered safely into the building, the gate and door shut firmly behind you, and the group of constables return to the precinct office. You can still hear the clamor from outside, but not for long. People give up and leave.

    Those incident reports don’t seem quite so fun anymore.

    You try to shake it off by exploring your apartment.

    It’s a complex of several rooms on the seventh floor of a newly constructed brick building near the district 14 central station. The height would be impressive if you weren’t used to the Cathedra; it’s certainly one of the very tallest buildings around. The fourteenth district is situated near the southwest of the city, where the Endle River flows out into the wastes, and is thus a prime spot for industry: waste can just be dumped into the river and it flows right out, never to be seen again! Anyway, the point is that, with all the factories and such, the district is typically dirty, sprawling, and not all that wealthy. So having a skyscraper here is a little weird; you suppose maybe it’s mostly for visitors from other districts. Maybe that’s why it’s so close to the station.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1265850568044187709 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1265850568044187709><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, July 24, 2024 9:58 PM">9:58 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The apartment itself certainly impresses you more than the building’s height. Your room at the Cathedra is well-built and clean, but simple. Humble, almost. This room is definitely not that. Glass and polished stone and beautiful wooden accents against the brick make it feel more like you’re a visiting factory owner than your actual self... though, if you think about it, you’re probably more important than any such owner. Why shouldn’t you get to try some luxury every so often? It’s just a break from your normal room anyway; it’s not like you’re going to live here permanently.

    ... <em>The bathtub is a hot tub.</em>

    ...

    You spend a little more time than strictly necessary utilizing <em>that</em> particular discovery, then change into a more normal outfit for your excursion into the city. You still need to find some food tonight or you’re going to be very hungry tomorrow, and you still intend to go out and experience the city in ways you’ve never been able to before. You’re just a <em>little</em> nervous about going out after sunset (still hate the dark; that hasn’t changed in the past few months). But you’ll manage.

    Okay, disguise on. Check your appearance and your clothes. You’ve learned from your trips with Erich to be more careful matching your outfit to the location, so you aren’t wearing anything ostentatious today. Just a standard cream dress with some accents, just like any “normal” young lady might wear. And you mean it this time; it’s not secretly fancy.

    You’ve also tried to make yourself look a little older with your disguise, but it doesn’t seem to have worked very well. You figured maybe that would help you be taken more seriously, but it just looks weird. So you revert it to normal and resolve to put in more practice later; you’re still bad at visualizing your own appearance well enough to change it like that.

Your hair is too smooth and, well, too pretty to match the plain dress. You ruffle it up a bit, noting as you do so that it’s gotten pretty long. You used to keep it trimmed a little past your shoulder blades, but since becoming an Angel you just haven’t cut it; it’s down to the small of your back by now. Your perfect Body means it simply hasn’t tangled, or split, or generally been a nuisance, which would be your usual cue to get the scissors out. Hmmm, it’s going to be tough to mess it up enough to look right. Maybe you should just get a hat? Can you even fit all of it under one?

    You’re probably overthinking this. You could just be a normal girl with a really good hair care routine. Perfect; okay, ready to go!

    But... go where?

    <em>Scene 140</em>
    Well, you’ll find out after looking around a bit. You leave through a different entrance, wrap around the building since you’re kind of curious if any of the crowd from earlier is still there (the toothless guy is, but no one else), and then stride confidently off under the railroad tracks. You figure there’s probably more shops near stations, and though you <em>could</em> ride the train to the next one, you figure you’ll take the opportunity to look for smaller places along the way. Plus, the tracks have plentiful streetlights on their undersides, so it’s not really very dark at all down here. It would probably feel pretty dim during the day, but at night it’s certainly brighter than on many nearby roads.

    The area is pretty lively at this point in the evening, busy with workers just finishing their shift or just arriving to take over for someone in the former category. You seem to blend in well. Though there aren’t many girls your age around, there are a number of older teenagers and up - presumably employed somewhere around here, since you haven’t seen a school nearby. If you act just a little older and a little tireder than you actually are (really would be nice if that disguise alteration had worked), you fit right in.

    You don’t really know where to go, so you cheat a little. Using your heightened hearing, you listen in on groups of workers discussing dinner plans until you overhear somewhere that sounds good, then casually change your path to follow them. There’s still enough people around that you can get away with this without looking weird, and before too long your unwitting guides lead you into a small restaurant built <em>between</em> two of the heavy pillars holding up the railway. You wonder how loud it is when a train goes by. After a moment’s consideration, you figure you’re going to find out pretty soon.

    ...

You can certainly <em>feel</em> it - the building vibrates under heavy wheels - but there must be something incredible in place to reduce the noise to roughly the same level as the general din. Hardly anyone seems to pay it any Mind.

    In other news, the food is good. Greasy, spicy, a little messy. Not the Cathedra’s clean, straightforward meals. The conversation is loud. Honestly, the same adjectives could apply to it as well. Certainly not like the Cathedra. And a number of the patrons here seem to be growing only louder as the night progresses.

    You know of alcohol, of course, and you know that you’re both too young and too holy to partake. Drunkenness is a sin, though a minor one, and you must maintain your purity. But that doesn’t mean you can’t just sit here, watching and listening to the people who aren’t young <em>or</em> holy. Although, as you scan through the general crowd, you aren’t the only youngish person around and the staff don’t seem to pay much attention to who exactly at a table consumes the drinks that are ordered. Perhaps it’s just your holiness stopping you, not your age. Well, it’s enough either way. You’ll just observe.

    There’s a group of grumbly-sounding gloved men at the bar. You had to do a double take when you saw them come in, since the mystery glove people from the sixth district immediately popped into your Mind, but these men took off their gloves like normal people when they ordered food. Now, they’re seemingly complaining about something related to the constables.

It’s tough to catch much of their conversation, since they’re not yelling and the loud men are, but you think it’s about working at a mill. And they seem... worried? You briefly wonder what they’re doing here all on their own, but figure that would make you a hypocrite for doing the same thing.

    A man smelling faintly of coal smoke and wearing clothes stained with the stuff sits with three fellows, muttering darkly about an incident on the river today. His friends seem sympathetic, but you can tell from your Body attunement that he’s not just distressed. He was injured today - badly, you think - though his heavy coat hides it.

    You’re curious and still have plenty of your (non-alcoholic) drink left as an excuse to linger, but you can only listen to one conversation in detail at a time. Whose?

    <em>Scene 141</em>
    Maybe it’s just their age or that they remind you a little bit of yourself, but you find yourself most curious about the girls’ conversation. Still, it’s tricky to hear much from all the way over here and it’s not like you can just move to a different seat; it’s far too busy for that. So you just do your best to make out their quiet voices through the general din and piece together what they’re saying.

    The one on the left - with the straight but choppy black hair and very pale skin - is Mila; you learn that as the other one says her name to get her attention. Unfortunately, this doesn’t happen the other way around, so you have to keep calling the other one “the other one” or something like that. Maybe you’ll call her “freckles” for now, but that kind of sounds mean actually so maybe you won’t. <em>C’mon, just say her name!</em> you urge Mila, but she doesn’t. Oh well.

    “... just worried about being transferred,” Mila is saying. “I don’t think you saw, but he was walking through our floor, looking at everyone and making notes. Maybe on who to move next?”

    You miss some portion of the response because the not-gloved-anymore men suddenly laugh about something. When you can hear them again, “... so bad if you really did get transferred? Can’t be much worse than this.”

    “It is! It pays a little more, but it’s so far away I’d have to pay for a train... or move.”

    The other girl nods empathetically. “I get it. I can’t move either. And I bet that extra pay’d just go right into the train fare.”

    “... Yeah. So it’d be harder work for less pay and I’d have less time at home... I don’t know how I could keep up, really.”

    A brief period of quiet. You’re briefly distracted by a waiter coming by to ask you something about your drink, and by the time you deal with that, you’ve missed another sentence or two. “... what they’re looking for? Like, can we act different to stay put?”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1267185140925468673 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1267185140925468673><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, July 28, 2024 2:21 PM">2:21 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“I don’t know.” Mila thinks about it for a moment. “Well, who’s been moved so far? Maybe they had something in common?”

    “Er... there was-” You get distracted again by the same waiter doubling back (it seems you should probably leave soon, as they’re asking you if they can take the dishes) and miss the list of names. Probably not important. Mila’s thinking again.

    “They’re all kinda young, aren’t they?” she asks, hesitantly. “I don’t think anyone in that list was older than 25.”

    “Hey, yeah. Well, I guess that makes sense if they want strong, healthy people. It’s a warehousing job, after all. Can’t be old and creaky.”

    “We’re not old and creaky, though. That’s not good.”

    “Maybe if you dress up like a grandma?” She regards Mila briefly. “You’re kinda halfway there already!”

    “Can’t you take this seriously? I’m really worried here! And y-you’ve got the same problems!”

    “Sooorry.” The other girl sighs, resting her chin on the table. “It’s just, it’s not like we’ve got a choice. Manager says go, there’s nothing to do. Y’know?”

    “...”

    “‘Nless you want to <em>quit.”</em>

    “No! I - I can’t do that! It’s... no one wants someone like... me.”

    “So-” There’s the waiter again. You get a few questions about if someone else will be paying the bill, but you reassure him that you have the money. He leaves again, to be back one more time to collect the payment. It takes you a bit longer than you’d like to count out all the bills and coins, so by the time you finally get everything ready, they’ve changed topic somewhat.

    “... know what it’s actually like over there? I haven’t heard from anyone who got transferred. Even people I talked to before.”

    The other girl has sat up again by now and is arranging silverware into a pyramid. “Nope. Haven’t seen any of them. Guess it makes sense if they moved away to not see ‘em anymore.”

    “That’s not... er, yeah.”

    You miss whatever Mila’s response might be as the waiter returns one final time and you have to leave. Well, you could <em>maybe</em> stay, but it sure would be rude. So you get up, clean up, and prepare to leave.

    <em>Scene 142</em>
    Well, not much for tonight. But you’ll keep an eye out. It’s unclear if there is actually anything in this situation you can do anything about - from a constable <em>or</em> Angel’s perspective - but you’ve been kind of on high alert for weird things after catching those lost Souls in the sixth district. Transferring people to a mystery warehousing job, never to be heard from again, definitely seems like it qualifies as “weird.” But it might just be a normal kind of weird, not corruption or illegal. You’ll have to find out. Later.

    So you head back to the apartment without incident, take another bath because what else are you going to do with a hot tub in your room, and eventually go to bed. You’re feeling pretty calm today, so it catches you completely off-guard when you wake up sprawled across the floor of some dark, wooden room, utterly certain that you’re dreaming.

    Uneasy, but not as panicked as if you thought this was real, you slowly stand up and look around. The floor is some sort of oddly smooth, oddly uniform stone covered in grit and dust, while the walls are ragged, splintery planks of deep, dark wood. There’s a door and a window, so you look out the window first.

    Barren, snowy wastes as far as the eye can see. It’s clearly night, but there’s no mist. Stars shine brilliantly overhead, reflecting off a thick carpet of snow that drowns any details of the landscape. Shadows of taller spire-like structures indicate that the building you’re in is more than just this room and that there’s a brighter light source behind or above you (the moon?).

You duck back behind the wall, peering into the darkness to see if anything heard that, but the gloom is near-impenetrable. There aren’t enough windows; they’re all placed up high in a slanted roof and only illuminate a tangled mess of girders, cranes, and other industrial detritus suspended far above floor level. Down on the ground, there’s nothing but blackness.

    But thankfully, you always have a light. You begin to glow, revealing tangled conveyor lines, ruined machinery, and piles of broken components. A few are recognizable as you inch further into the room. Gears, hinges, fittings. Tiny pipes; wires to conduct heat. But others are less understandable. Strange, green plates with a texture you’ve never before felt. Miniscule barrel-like things with tiny metal legs. Flexible wires, like the pipes from before, but braided together with odd assemblies on each end. You’re walking through a destroyed factory, but what it once made is beyond you.

    “Why am I seeing this?” you whisper aloud, not really expecting an answer. You certainly don’t have one. If this dream is from your own Mind, you’d love to know where you got the ideas for all these weird mechanical components. Maybe you saw them once in your dad’s work and forgot? But if it’s <em>not</em> from you-

    The silver-eyed shade. It’s here, standing atop a pile of broken metal that may have once been a machine. You’ve just blundered right up to it, unable to see its shadowy form in the total darkness.

    It looks at you. You’re not frozen, not like the last two times. Turns its head slightly, just as before. Arms folded. <em>Looking.</em>

Why not?!

    “...”

    What... <em>is</em> it going to do, actually? It’s just standing there. Its form slowly shifts, though the contours themselves never change. Menacing, despite its stillness. Or perhaps <em>because</em> of its stillness.

    Slowly, the shade unfolds one arm. You take a half-step back, ready to react if it does anything aggressive, and it notes that movement with a fleeting glance. But all it does. Is take the arm. And very slowly.

    Point behind you.

    <em>Scene 143</em>
    Hesitantly, you look behind you. What else is there to do?

    There’s nothing there. Well, there’s plenty there, but nothing has changed. Still just a tangled mess of mechanical debris and ruined machines. Suddenly concerned that you’ve fallen for the oldest trick in the book, you quickly turn back to the shade, but it hasn’t moved either.

    “...” <em>What does it...?</em> You pause. Shades can speak, if they want to. Maybe you can simply ask instead of wondering silently in your head. “W-What do you want to show me?”

    The shade does not speak, but it does respond. Its silver eyes shift down slightly, and it takes a step on the pile. You match it, retreating another step, but it doesn’t come after you. Instead, it very conspicuously picks up a damaged mechanical lamp from the mess, holds it up for you to see, and then crushes the bulb in one shadowy hand. Glass shards and powder scatter to the floor. And then it points again; not behind you, but <em>at</em> you.

    <em>Is that a threat? Is it saying that I’m like the bulb? Does it want to crush me? But... but it could have just attacked if it wanted to do that, not... whatever this is.</em>

    The shade points behind you again. Something occurs to you. “Do... do you want me to turn off my light?”

    The shade lowers its arm. It’s still looking at you.

    “...” You swallow nervously. You can only interpret that as a “yes,” but to disable your glow and leave yourself completely blind in total darkness, with this creature standing <em>right there</em>... You shiver, imagining your brutal death at its hands.

    <em>But this is a dream. It’s not real. Even if it feels real...</em>

    You suppress your glow before you can change your Mind. The light vanishes quickly, as if grateful to return to the total darkness that is natural to this place. And then, because you don’t know what else to do, you look behind you again.

A thick, flexible, transparent tube about the width of your arm hangs behind you. It glows with an extremely faint light, only visible in near-total darkness, that barely reveals the smooth, glassy surface of its shape. The tube disappears up into the jumble of debris above... and below, it sinks into the small of your back.

    You reach back and touch it, shivering at the eerie warmth. The tube pierces your clothing and skin, embedding itself inside of you. Your Body is hot, almost feverish at the point of contact, but otherwise you don’t feel it at all. Even the warmth is only noticeable now that you’re touching it with your hands. How long has this been here? <em>Why</em> is it here? Why did the shade want you to see it?

    You’re doing it again. The shade hasn’t killed you, and by its still-visible silver eyes, you can tell it hasn’t even moved since you turned off your glow. You don’t have to wonder; you can just...

    “What is this?” There’s so much more you want to ask, now that it seemingly isn’t going to be attacking, but you figure you’ll start with the obvious question.

    The shade slowly shakes its head, only visible as its eyes move in the darkness.

    “... Do you not know? Or do-”

    Another rejection, before you can even get to the second part of your question. You hesitate for a moment, struggling to figure it out. “You can understand me.” A statement, but you want to know how it agrees with you. If it does.

    The eyes shift up and down, as if nodding.

    “But you can’t speak?”

    Another nod.

    “But...” Now you arrive at the problem. “Shades <em>can</em> speak. Your kind can negotiate with us. At least, the ones with Minds. And, er, it seems... like... you, er, do.”

    Nod.

    “...” <em>It can speak, but it can’t? Ah!</em> “The tube. Is this... interfering in some way?”

    Nod.

    “Can I take it out?”

    Nod.

    “... What happens if I do?”

    No answer. It just looks at you.

You’ve certainly improved since your first time on the wall, but all three of your aspects protest its presence, even in a dream. It has tried to kill you twice before, and succeeded once. And this isn’t even <em>just</em> a creature of darkness: this is a <em>shade.</em> One of the rare few with a Mind, cunning and willing to bargain with humans and Angels alike to advance its goals. Your mortal enemy.

    And you’re seriously considering following its advice. Just to be able to hear it speak? Do you really want that? Surely if it’s asking you to do something - even indirectly, since you came up with the idea - that’s a bad thing to do. Right?

    But this tube doesn’t feel right either. You turn halfway, holding onto it with one hand so you can look at it without bending around too much. It hardly illuminates your skin, even when directly touching, but it still glows with heat. There doesn’t appear to be anything <em>in</em> the tube - no substances being extracted from you and no strange material being inserted. Just the heat and the strange, uneasy knowledge that there <em>could</em> be.

    Experimentally, almost without meaning to, you give the tube a little tug. It shifts in your back and you flinch, feeling a quick stab of pain where it connects to you. A diminishing echo of the jolt fades over the next few seconds. Your heart rate rises. If that was just a tug, what will it feel like when you tear it out?

    “...”

    <em>Aggghhhh!</em> You just don’t <em>know</em> enough! This is a dream, sure, but if you’re willing to accept the shade is real, then certainly there can be consequences for things that happen here. Removing a strange, glowing tube from yourself that has been there for who knows how long is not a simple decision to make. What if you hurt yourself in reality? Sure, that’s never happened before, even when you died twice in a row, but... it <em>could!</em> ... Probably.

It makes no sound, movement, or anything else. You almost complain at it; willing it to protest its innocence or prove its villainy. The shade shifts on its pile of rubble, descending a step or two towards you. It doesn’t seem to be willing to wait forever.

    W-what if...

    “H-hold on,” you stammer, backing away as if to ward it off. Almost surprisingly, the shade stops. “I... I haven’t decided yet. If...” A deep breath; you feel incredibly nervous. Caught between two mysterious forces of unknown danger. “... If I don’t take it out... are you g-going to...” Breathe. No need to panic. You can’t decide how to finish that sentence. “Attack?” “Leave?” “Remove it yourself?”

    The shade nods. You don’t know what you said, if anything. Finally, something moves in the tube. A tiny - miniscule, even - thread of silver liquid winds its way out of your Body and up into the ceiling. A larger streak of deep red blood accompanies it. You shudder, almost lightheaded even though you didn’t feel a thing. Silver. The color of magic. Of your Soul’s light. Of this shade’s eyes. What is it <em>doing</em> to you?

    <em>Scene 144</em>
    Moments slip by as you hesitate. Neither option seems appealing. But somehow, this external threat - the one you know, at least to some degree - almost seems preferable to the internal threat. The one you don’t. The tube is taking something from you. Something silver. Something precious? Important?

    You find yourself breathing quickly as you grasp the tube with both hands. Shaking, just a little. It’s flexible enough that you can compress it slightly with your grip. The shade only watches, nothing but a pair of silver eyes in the dark. Your heartbeat is loud in your ears. This - what if you’re wrong? What if you’re about to do something irreversible? What if-

    You’ve always hated hospitals. Ever since your sickness. Doctors, needles, implements. And tubes much like this one.

    You’re breathing too fast. Your heart is beating too fast. You’re thinking too fast.

    You tear out the tube.

    There’s a ghastly sound as the thing separates from your flesh. Wet, slimy splatterings as the clear fluid it had contained splashes onto the floor. You collapse to the ground, overwhelmed with pain. Movement is impossible; it feels like the sun is embedded in your back. You would scream, if you could.

    The shade approaches. Kneels beside your head. Slips a fuzzy, shadowy hand under your chin and lifts it so you have no choice but to look into its eyes. Its form is blurry through the tears.

    “Well done,” it rasps. It has no mouth, but the outline of its head vibrates with its voice: that of a scratchy, whispering elder. “Your strings are cut. You are His puppet no longer.”

    It feels like you’re falling. Its words bounce around in your head, unable to find purchase through the haze of agony. But something sticks. The way it pronounced “His.” Emphasized. Capitalized. Divine.

    You feel like you’ve made a horrible mistake.

It stands; moves out of your view. A sound you don’t know how to describe. And then silence.

    Minutes pass. Slowly, slowly, the torture fades. You can breathe again. Move your trembling hands; wipe the tears from your eyes. Your fingers are slick with blood. Carefully, you reach back to feel for the gaping hole it must have left in your torso.

    Nothing. The pain is receding quickly now and you fumble your way into a kneeling position, twisting around to see behind you. The shade is nowhere to be seen. Your back is whole, though there is a neat circle cut out of your clothing that marks where the tube had connected. But beneath it, instead of a raw wound gushing with blood, there’s a strange, triangular design formed out of scars or raised skin. It almost looks like the matan, but... different. The triangle’s bottom side is missing, and the circle is inside of it instead.

    You run your hand over the pattern, wincing at the heat and brief jolts of pain. It’s still very tender and even that momentary touch has prompted a few dots of blood to well out.

    The tube hangs just behind you, dangling empty and deflated. A puddle of clear, jelly-like substance mixes with blood and occasional tiny filaments of silver or gold liquid. There’s a terrifying assemblage of hooks and barbs on the lower end where it had connected to you; scraps of flesh still - you look away, feeling sick.

    Where is the shade? No - there’s something more important. <em>“You are His puppet no longer,”</em> it said. <em>His</em> puppet. You - was that - did you just...

    You turn your glow back on, momentarily relieved that it still works. Still marks you as an Angel. Your worst fears fail to materialize. And, as you attune to Body and cause gusts of wind to dance around you as well, the relief becomes even greater. You haven’t cut yourself off from magic. From Soul. From God.

    So what <em>was</em> that tube?

H-hello?” you call into the darkness, not nearly as scared now that you’ve met surely the most dangerous thing that could dwell in it. “Are you still there?”

    Eerie silence, and then a brief rustle from above. You look up, then jump aside in surprise as the rest of the tube crashes down beside you, flopping into a tangled, disordered pile. Like discarded snakeskin. Empty; dead. The shade drops next to it, landing gracefully and returning to its upright posture. Its left hand is a blade, but it quickly returns to normal. You think you know what it was doing up there.

    “Yes,” it says simply.

    “... W-what did I just do?”

    “You cut your strings.”

    “What does that mean?”

    “You are now free.”

    “...” You decide to change tactics. “Who are you?”

    “One who never had strings.”

    A nervous swallow. If this shade never had strings, and now you don’t... “D-do you have a name?”

    “Those without strings bear no names.”

    “...” A pause; you take a moment to make sure you remember your own name. Jessamine Laura Goodall. It’s okay. You’re okay. Breathe. “What do you want with me? Why do you keep following me in dreams?”

    “It offers alternatives. For the one who cut her strings, and the one with broken strings.”

    “Al...ternatives?” You try to work through the obtuse titles the shade seems to use in place of names. “I - I’m the one who cut her - my - strings, right? Then... the one with broken strings...”

    A floating guillotine blade forms behind the shade and clangs into the floor, severing a segment of the deflated tube as it does so.

    “H-half-Angel?”

    “A puppet with half its strings is a broken puppet. But it can be mended.”

    “How?!”

    “He will not allow it. Broken puppets serve not His purpose. But it provides for all.”

    “Th-that’s not an answer! How do I save her?”

    “It can fix the one with broken strings. You must simply arrange a meeting.”

    “W-who is ‘it?’ Is that just... you?”

    “It has no strings.”

    “... Y-So, yes? I... I need to think. How can I, er, arrange a meeting?”

    You wake up instantly, transitioning in an eyeblink from the dark, broken-down factory to the light, opulent apartment. There’s too much to think about. Too much you have to consider and remember and maybe even tell, but you just need to understand it first. And there’s no time to do that now; you’ve only got a few minutes to get ready before you have to meet your escort to the constabulary.

    But before <em>any</em> of that...

    You run to the bathroom and turn around so your back is facing the mirror. Grip the hem of your nightclothes anxiously. And quickly get it over with, pulling it up so you can inspect the-

    Not there.

    You breathe out in relief, running your fingers over smooth skin just to be sure. Of course it’s not there. Nothing in a dream has ever affected your physical Body. Just... this one felt... different, somehow.

    Whatever; you have to get ready! You cheat a little with magic, both to speed things up and to make sure you still have the ability in the waking world too. Everything’s fine. You feel perfectly healthy and normal. No aches in your lower back, no strange chills, and certainly no mysterious symbols traced into your skin.

    In fact, you kind of feel a little <em>better</em> than normal. You can’t quite pinpoint it, but there’s just something a little stronger about you today. A little calmer. A little more in control, perhaps?

    You hurry downstairs to meet the constables.

    <em>Scene 145</em>
    That sensation of control persists throughout the work day. You spend some time on more paperwork, some time learning about the constables’ new rifles (so you can better coordinate with them and soldiers in dangerous situations, not so you can use one yourself), and some time following up on various leads from yesterday. Some of your inferences have borne fruit and you have more data to sift through, but that’s not what you’re most interested in. You’re looking for details on what those girls were worried about.

    And, delightfully, you find something.

    Honestly, given how little information you have, you didn’t really expect any results. But it turns out one of the few female constables at the station happens to have a friend who works at the same mill and knows Mila. It’s a real coincidence and she’s just as surprised as you are when the two of you connect the dots. But that helps get you names, locations, details, and even the other girl’s name so you can stop calling her “the other one.” It’s Kate, by the way.

    Anyway, it’s not like the constables track every person all the time, so you don’t know if any of the people transferred to the warehouse job are actually missing or if they just didn’t keep in touch. In fact, you won’t even get a list of who was transferred unless you can convince one of the mill’s managers to give you one. But that should be no problem for a constable. Or at least, no problem for a constable who is also an Angel.

    You run out of time in the day before you’re able to dig up anything else. Still, it’s a lot of progress. You’ll follow up later. At the end of your shift, you change into the normal clothes you intelligently brought to the station today and can skip the escort back to your apartment. Then it’s off to find somewhere else to eat, some more rumors to listen to (though they don’t lead anywhere today), and finally back to bed to think about everything the shade said.

You can see why; it makes sense from its point of view. God doesn’t directly control the Angels, but He does choose who Ascends and there’s the whole Cathedra in place to ensure they live up to their responsibilities. As soon as God chose you in the Calling chamber, your life - to some degree - became predetermined. You will train for six years, graduate, and defend the city and its population. Eventually, you will fall in battle (twice, probably) and die. If you ignore the specifics, you do sort of seem like a puppet. Plucked from your ordinary life to be thrown against the corruption and eventually discarded. Your Angelic energy released and reused to cause some other kid to Ascend and start the cycle anew. At least, you figure that might be how that part works.

    And its description of Naoriel as a broken puppet makes sense too. You already know she’s dangerous: her unstable Soul could lead to another Erejil situation. From the Cathedra’s perspective, it’s not worth it to try to fix the puppet. Throw it away and Ascend a new one.

    You can understand the shade’s perspective. It makes sense; it seems reasonable. And that worries you. This thing is one of the most dangerous, most deceptive creatures of the corruption, and it’s offering to help. It’s offering to save someone the Cathedra would kill.

    So, what’s the catch?

    Well, the most obvious one would be that the shade’s “help” is just turning Naoriel to the corruption. Making her into a fallen Angel; using her to change the rules, just like Erejil did. And then, once she’s killed or captured and her connection to the Lordstone is broken, the corruption will abandon her just as readily as the Cathedra. A puppet whose purpose has been served; a puppet whose strings have been cut. After all, the corruption’s sole purpose is to destroy us utterly. It will lie and scheme and say whatever you want to hear in order to further that goal. Never, ever, listen.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1270151296724504629 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1270151296724504629><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, August 5, 2024 6:47 PM">6:47 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>At least, that’s the line from the play <em>False Angel Erejil.</em> It just makes sense. You shouldn’t trust it.

    But somehow, you can’t get that little ember of hope out of your Mind. You know the corruption has ways of manipulating Minds and Souls that the Cathedra doesn’t. It has to, for shades to exist. Creatures that should be impossible after God’s sacrifice, yet here they are.

    But why would it help you? Even assuming the shade somehow holds the power to help Naoriel, why would it use it? You’re the enemy. Your purpose is to destroy <em>it</em> utterly. <em>You</em> will lie and scheme and say whatever it wants to hear in order to further that goal. Why should it help you gain another Angel that will help destroy it? You don’t believe it’s just being nice; that simply doesn’t happen.

    Which leads you back to the first idea again. But if it’s so obvious, then surely the shade would know that too. They’re supposed to be smart enough to tempt and trick Angels. Just offering something that’s an obvious lie isn’t very convincing.

    Maybe it could want peace? Wars have been settled before, in the time before year zero, without the utter destruction of one faction. Maybe the corruption intends to negotiate, now that it has enough Minds to do so?

    ... You can’t take that idea seriously. But what <em>is</em> the alternative? There has to be one! It’s driving you nuts!

    “...”

    Maybe... maybe becoming a fallen Angel isn’t a death sentence.

    That’s a dangerous thought.

    Angelic Souls are powerful enough to survive immense levels of corruption, usually. Half-Angels might work differently, but the point is that most fallen Angels retain their Minds and Souls (and magic, through their divine connection) after their fall. Even Erejil did, which is of course why he was so dangerous. Every fallen Angel died soon after their fall... but not to the corruption. They were killed by their fellow Angels, or executed after being stripped of their powers by the Emissary.

Sure, they would be corrupted, but what <em>is</em> the corruption associated with such a fall, actually? If it doesn’t destroy your Body, Mind, or Soul - like it would an ordinary human - what <em>does</em> it do? Are you turned into a monstrous version of yourself? Clearly not, as fallen Angels often go undetected for a while. Are you made subservient to the corruption? Maybe, but you’re not convinced. The stories always make it seem like the fallen Angel <em>chooses</em> to commit horrible acts, not that they’re being <em>forced</em> into it by some sort of Mind control.

    Would a fallen Angel Naoriel be - somehow - <em>healthier</em> than a half-Angel Naoriel?

    You don’t know. And you would bet <em>anything</em> that you won’t get a straight answer from the shade if you ask it.

    God, and you haven’t even thought about yourself yet. The tube; your mysterious sense of confidence that still hasn’t quite faded. You’ve just been too distracted wondering about Naoriel to wonder if <em>you’re</em> going to be immediately arrested and executed after returning to campus. Are you corrupted? It doesn’t feel like it, but would you even be able to tell? Is your connection to God still okay? You can still glow and cast magic and such, but again: are you able to tell for sure? The Emissary can see all kinds of things in Souls that even top Angels can’t, but you’d be kind of super mega nervous to tell him about any of this. “Oh, yeah, I talked to a <em>shade</em>” all casual-like. And then you get turned to ash by his Lordstone powers.

    You’re rambling now and you know it. There won’t be any true answers found just by thinking very hard. You’ll have to figure out what to do without knowing all the facts. But that’s nothing new.

    <em>Scene 146</em>
    You don’t dream that night, or the next, or the two after that. Another day of preparation passes, then two more. You need a lot of paperwork to actually go out and <em>do</em> anything, so you’re stuck in limbo and other work as approvals work their way through various levels of bureaucracy. But finally, enough people with enough authority have agreed to let you go to the mill and do some proper investigating. Remila, the constable from earlier who has a friend there, accompanies you as your partner, and you manage to decline the offer of a larger group. You want to do this as normally as you can, and a squad of twenty constables coming along to look after you would be... not that. Plus, it’d be kind of embarrassing. You can look after yourself.

    So off you go in your official constable uniform, not dressed as an Angel today. It’s a little big for you (they don’t tend to have many constables your size) but with a bit of disguise magic you can make the outfit seem more presentable. It’s a little unclear how exactly this doesn’t count as transmutation either (disguise magic is just weird, okay?) but apparently you’re “adding” tidiness or “removing” wrinkles? At least it works as long as you think about it that way. Close enough.

    After a brief train journey (during which you get several strange looks, hopefully just due to your apparent age), you arrive near the mill in question. As with many factories in this part of the city, it’s a large brick building with a few large chimneys for the on-site steam plant that powers the machinery. Narrow, grimy windows don’t really afford any view of the interior, even as you get up close. It feels like a place of... not despair, exactly, but certainly not happiness. You consider switching to Soul to get a better sense of any corruption nearby, but decide the hassle of redoing your disguise would be too much. You would have noticed anything egregious as-is anyway. You’ll take a Soul-look later.

Request the list and a few other details that might be helpful; present your authorization paperwork in case he had any doubts. The man takes his time looking it over, then requests even more time to find the records. In the meantime, a different manager escorts you around the floor to inspect whatever you’d like.

    No one here seems pleased to see you. There’s no outright hostility - certainly, the managers are treating you with careful (if confused) politeness - but there is a sense of wariness and... perhaps distrust. No one you talk to offers much of use. Workers have seen their friends transferred, but haven’t spoken to anyone afterwards. Managers speak at length about the advantages of the move and the specifics the new job entails. Sorting, stacking, carrying, loading, unloading; it’s exactly what you’d expect, basically. All the minute details that mean absolutely nothing. It sort of feels like you’re just wasting time. How long does it take to get a stack of papers ready that they should already have available? You don’t see Mila or Kate anywhere, though you haven’t toured the whole factory yet.

    Eventually, the first manager comes back. “Found the paperwork, madames. Hiding down in the back offices. If you’d like to inspect them, please follow me.”

    You very much would like to inspect them (and hopefully get some copies), so off you go back to the lobby, then down a narrow staircase just beside it. This leads into the mill’s basement, where the steam plant and back offices are located. It’s incredibly loud down here, as well as hot and humid; your guide almost has to shout to be heard over the mechanical din. But finally, he shows you a slim wooden door tucked beside a tangle of pipes. Inside is a long, narrow room crammed with filing cabinets and a few desks. A third manager sits near the back of the room, arranging a stack of papers. He looks up as you enter and beckons you over.

You start to recoil in surprise, but strong arms wrap around and drag you back. A rag doused in horrible-smelling liquid is pressed to your face; out of the corner of your eye, you see Remila falling to the ground, another man standing over her holding a smoking <em>gun</em>.

    <em>Wh-wh- I - DO SOMETHING!</em>

    You shock yourself into action, struggling against the man’s grip. You’re so much stronger than you look that you catch him off guard and actually manage to break an arm free, elbowing him in the gut and eliciting a grunt as his other hand loosens... but then another man joins in (perhaps the shooter) and you don’t have a chance. Still, you strain against them both, instinctively holding your breath to thwart whatever they’re trying to force you to inhale, but you have to breathe and it’s just... not... enough.

    “How the hell’s she still awake?!” one of them exclaims as your vision starts to tunnel towards blackness. “Did you fuck up the dose?”

    “----------” You can’t catch whatever the other man says in response. Instead, you pass out.

    ...

    You drift into consciousness some time later. Rough cloth covers your eyes and mouth; there are heavy metal chains on your wrists and ankles. The floor and wall are wood, and the entire room rattles. You’re clearly in a carriage or wagon, being transported somewhere.

    Terror sets in quickly. This isn’t a dream. You’ve actually been kidnapped. Your breathing quickens as you try to figure out what to do. Should you try to make noise? Wiggle around? Stay still? The constables will notice you’re missing soon, if they haven’t already, and they’ll surely inform the Cathedra. Angels will be out looking for you before nightfall. But... will that be fast enough? Where are you being taken; will anyone even be able to find you?

He responds to the movement immediately. “Shit! Definitely awake! What do I do?”

    “Calm down and keep your damn eyes open like you’re supposed to. If she makes trouble, knock her out again. Not hard, is it?” That’s a different voice, from the direction of travel. The driver, maybe?

    “B-but... s-she; I mean, have you <em>looked</em> at her? Someone must’ve fucked up <em>bad</em> to send us off with a - an - A-Angel!”

    A brief moment of shock, but it makes sense that they would know. Your disguise requires concentration to maintain; it would have dropped as soon as you passed out. But... for these men to dare kidnap an Angel... The terror surges higher. You never really considered that anything truly bad could happen to you in the city, except by corruption. Even if criminals targeted you for some reason, they would stop if you revealed your true form. No one would dare harm an Angel.

    Or so you thought.

    “So what? Angel or not; can’t do anything all tied up like that. If you’re really scared, knock her out again. I won’t tell.” The driver chuckles gratingly.

    “That’s not the problem! She’s holy! Chosen by God! W-we need to set her free! Beg for forgiveness! Y-you can’t just <em>do</em> this to the divine!”

    “Never knew you were religious,” the driver responds. “But shut up and do what you’re told or you won’t live long enough to be cursed, or whatever. You think her Angel buddies would just let you go if we set her free? The conners? Hmm?”

    “... No.”

    “So keep watchin’ her till we get there. Then you can spend the night in penance or something.”

    “... Alright.” A brief pause, then you feel him shifting closer to you (though not close enough you could reach him). A quieter voice. “Er, s-sorry ‘bout this. If that means anything.”

    “Hey! What part of ‘shut up’ don’t you understand? Don’t talk to her!”

    You feel horrible. Not physically - you’re just a little dizzy and sore; otherwise fine. But the anticipatory fear of wherever these men are taking you mixes with a paradoxical guilt that you should have seen this coming and stopped it. The carriage stinks of corruption, even without being attuned to Soul. If you had just taken the time to look earlier instead of worrying about your disguise...!

    The sense of control from your meeting with the shade has gone entirely now.

    What do you do?

    <em>Scene 147</em>
    Your immediate thought is to try to escape. You can use magic; you’re super strong; <em>surely</em> you have some way to get out of here. But as you think about it, holding as still as you can and trying to slow your breathing, there’s actually not a lot you can do physically with the chains on your limbs. Sure, if they weren’t there you could take off the blindfold and break out of whatever vehicle this is, then run away before they could catch up. Easy. But... you don’t know any spells that can help you with solid metal. You’ve been focusing on Mind, not Body.

    But... you’ve been focusing on <em>Mind.</em>

    Still trying to stay quiet so the nervous thug won’t do anything stupid, like knock you out again, you try to calm yourself down enough to focus on Mind. It’s very hard work in this situation and you still don’t seem to have the ability to instantly switch. Is it because Naoriel isn’t here? Are you still not in enough danger? Or... have you lost it somehow?

    You try and fail to distract yourself with those thoughts; every shuffle or cough from the thug nearby feels like the approach of another horrible-smelling cloth. But eventually, after minutes of trying to stay calm, you finally switch aspects and hold a tenuous grip on Mind. It’ll have to do.

The sound of horse hooves ahead mingles with a background thrum of machinery and distant voices, but there are no people nearby. You’re probably still in the fourteenth district somewhere, but definitely not in a central location. The stench of corruption is heavy, but stale. The carriage has been exposed to enough of it to absorb some darkness - as Brother Cobb explained, even objects can be corrupted - but the people inside aren’t corrupted. At least, not enough to explain their behavior. You had sort of been giving them the benefit of the doubt, thinking maybe they were possessed or something, but... they seem to be doing this of their own free will. Perhaps influenced by corruption, but not controlled by it.

    But what you really want to know isn’t something you can tell from your senses alone. With a shaky inhale, you shift slightly and focus on the nervous thug. He shuffles in response, but doesn’t quite say anything. Good. You were really worried he’d freak out.

    Connection. You need a connection. But you don’t know anything about this man! You know he’s nervous, which you could maybe use as common ground, but his anxiety and yours aren’t really the same. Different sources, different intensities, and... it just <em>feels</em> different. You can’t use anything basic like “human” either, not in your current state of Mind. You’ve never felt more distant from the regular human race. But there has to be <em>something</em> you can use!

    “...”

    Guilt? Specifically, his guilt due to... well, you. And since you’re the target of that particular feeling, you don’t need to share it. Which is good, because although you’re certainly feeling <em>extremely</em> guilty right now, it’s for different reasons. You try not to think about the gunshot. So sudden. Your grip on the aspect wavers, but you have to hold on. Just... think about something else. Like your magic.

It’s not nearly as clear as with a two-way connection between Angels, but you’ve practiced this with Noll. You know how to pick out the details you want, even when they’re blurry. And you know how to be sneaky about it. In fact, you’re so absorbed in your task that you almost forget how much danger you’re in, which only helps your concentration. It’s like a puzzle! Briefly.

    You’re not going to a warehouse. You’ve already been to the warehouse, and now you’re being moved again. The man whose Mind you’re reading doesn’t even know about the mill; all he knows is that sometimes he’s called upon to move people from a certain locked room to a certain... you struggle to make out the destination. Is it... water? A pond, or the river? You strain your ears, trying to make out the sound of waves or boats that could tell you, and... yes! Distant, but just barely audible: the tell-tale splashing of the Endle River breaking against docks and posts. You must be near the northern side of the district, between the outer wall and the border with the thirteenth.

    But your sense of accomplishment fades quickly as the river sounds grow louder and more obvious. You’re clearly heading straight for it and would have picked that up soon even without the Mind magic. The thug’s current thoughts seem to center around locations and his worries about you; you can’t get anything about who he might work for or why he’s doing this at all. Have you even gotten anything useful out of this? So far, it’s just been something you could have figured out anyway and that this guy doesn’t know anything!

A spell you haven’t practiced much, but one that could be extremely useful if you can pull it off. You have no idea how long you have until you get wherever you’re going, so you do your best to pull in as much information about the man as you’ve gleaned over this brief time, then release your magic. A gentle stretching sensation pulls behind your eyes, then...

    You’re looking at yourself. The man whose senses you’re borrowing brings his hands up to his face, muttering worriedly about his eyes; the driver grouchily asks what he’s muttering about and he says nothing important. Your Body is so tiny from the thug’s perspective; it feels like he could snap you like a twig. But you’re not here just to watch the inside of the carriage; you’re here to figure out what’s going on.

    You do your best to memorize the driver’s appearance as best you can from this angle in a few seconds, then scan the edges of the man’s vision for anything identifying. The carriage is windowless in the back, so you won’t be able to see anything from there. But up front, as the driver mutters something like “Almost there,” the thug watching you lets his gaze wander. And... <em>there!</em> A small, high-up angle lets in a glimpse of sky... and Nucarreo’s outer wall. You’re right on the edge of the city and right next to the river, in the fourteenth district. There’s only one place this could possibly be: the industrial waste disposal plant. Or at least very close to it.

    But that realization just brings another with it. If you could tell anyone where to look, you’d be found right away now that you have a location. But if anyone were here to tell, they would have already found you! Briefly, you consider trying telepathy again, but you’re well aware it’s completely beyond your abilities; you’ve only got a maximum range of a few hundred feet, and that’s <em>with</em> a pre-existing connection.

    You switch targets as quickly as you can, feeling the carriage slow as you approach a nondescript wooden garage, then scream out your location as best you can. Not verbally, of course, but Mentally. If any Angels happen to be... basically within the block, they’ll be able to hear.

    The nervous thug flinches. “H-hey, did you just suddenly think about the-”

    “-the disposal plant?” the driver finishes. “Yes...”

    <em>Humans can hear it too!</em> Even if you’re not targeting them directly! Good to know! Very good to know!

    Silence for a few seconds. You try to get your sense-sharing spell back, but the thug’s state of Mind has changed. And as you’re trying to deal with that...

    “Knock her out again,” the driver says coldly.

    “E-eh?”

    “Better to be safe if that was her doing. Who knows what else she can do?”

    “I-if you’re sure...”

    No! Nononono you’ll lose any further opportunities if they do that! You panic for a moment, trying to come up with a solution, then quickly latch onto the first thought that comes to Mind. No time to reconsider; just do it <em>NOW!</em>

    The thug douses a rag with the same horrible fluid from earlier - you can’t see it at the moment, as you’re working on a different spell, but you can smell it already - then moves up close. “S-sorry,” he mutters, then-

    A few moments’ hesitation. You let your Body slide down the side of the carriage as if you’re asleep. The man never even held the cloth up to your face. Your heart thumps so loudly you swear he should be able to hear it.

    “O-okay, she’s out,” the thug announces. “Hate this stuff.”

You planted the idea in his head that he had already drugged you, before he actually did it. He honestly thinks he just knocked you out, even though you’re only pretending! You - you desperately try to steady your breathing, as if you’re really sleeping. Thankfully, it takes him long enough to get rid of the rag that you can mostly calm down before he returns, and you even have enough time to bring the sense-sharing spell back up, this time being careful to activate it when the driver says something so the thug won’t feel tempted to mention the twinge behind his eyes.

    They’ve brought the carriage into the nondescript garage you noticed earlier and the driver has gotten out to close the door. “Okay, unhook the chains and get ready to carry her. Move quick, before she wakes up again.”

    They’re going to take the chains off! W-what do you do?!

    <em>Scene 148</em>
    Switching aspects to Body is tempting, as that would make you stronger and faster, but you’re already on Mind and need to maintain the spell so you can see what’s going on. So... a slightly different plan. You don’t need Body magic to temporarily disable two ordinary humans. At least, as long as you can time and target everything properly.

    Right away, your plan hits a snag. The thug starts working on your chains, but the driver leaves his field of view. You hear a door opening and some conversation. There are more people here beyond just these two! O-obviously, now that you think about it. They have to be delivering you <em>to</em> someone. But that makes your plan even more precarious; how many people can you safely disable at once? You’ve done up to two in practice, but even that is somewhat straining and it’s not something you get much training in. As, of course, most darkness creatures don’t have Minds and it’s rare that an Angel needs to subdue humans. The spell does work on shades (at least theoretically) but you’re not anywhere near experienced enough to be working on that sort of magic.

    Your arms are now free, but the thug pauses to tie your wrists together with a length of rope before moving on to your legs. Another problem; your confidence (never high to begin with) lowers again. You could maybe break it with Body magic, but - you stealthily pull against it when the thug isn’t looking - it’s certainly too strong for you to break with just your normal strength. You don’t <em>need</em> your arms to run away, but they would certainly help!

There are two more men nearby talking to the driver; the thug glances up briefly so you can get a look at them. Dark masks and hoods obscure most of their features, leaving only their eyes visible. Eyes which, you’re alarmed to note, aren’t a natural color. The hue has been drained from their irises, leaving them sickly, pale grey. These men are humans, but they’ve clearly been touched by some sort of power.

    “... impressed that you managed to bring her here safely,” one of them says. “Has she been unconscious the whole way?”

    “Yes,” the driver lies smoothly; the thug glances up momentarily, but doesn’t say anything. “The dosage had to be adjusted higher, but it still works.”

    “Interesting. This is the first Angel we’ve captured; I’m certain we’ll get enormous value out of her. Your payment for this delivery will be tripled, as long as you breathe not a word of this to anyone.”

    “Very generous of you. Our lips are sealed.” The driver eyes the thug, who nods vigorously. He also finishes unbinding your legs, but everyone’s looking at you and you’re still lying down and it would be really hard to stand up without your arms and - ack, you need to start preparing the other spell - <em>God you hope this works</em> - so you reluctantly break your connection with the thug’s senses and change your target to every Mind you can sense in the room. Four people at once. You hope you can do it. You <em>need</em> to be able to do it.

    There’s some rustling and clinking as money is exchanged. Then the thug picks you up, drooping you over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes. “Where d’ya w-want her?” he asks.

    “Just down the-”

    You release your magic.

But to them, it would be an amped-up version of the telepathy from earlier. A Mental scream loud enough to overwhelm senses and scramble thoughts. The effect will only last a few seconds since you’re targeting so many people, but it will be enough. It has to be.

    The thug drops you immediately, moving his hands to clutch his head. You - blessedly - manage to land on your feet and stay standing. You are now free to run... but run where? You’re still blindfolded and can’t use your arms, and all the doors are closed!

    There is literally no time to hesitate; you pick a direction that seems to match up with what you remember of the room’s arrangement and sprint blindly. You slam into a wall within moments, but hardly register the pain. Door; door; where is the door?!

    A handle pokes you in the side; you maneuver so you can just barely grasp it with your hands tied behind your back. Fumble with the smooth metal as you anxiously listen for anyone to get up after the spell. It’s so slippery and hard to turn from this angle and you just can’t be defeated by a <em>doorknob</em> of all things but you hear angry shouting and footsteps and you finally get the thing to turn and-!!!

    A hand closes around one arm. You yank against it, shoving the door open into warm sunlight and screaming against the gag hoping that <em>anyone</em> at all can hear you. But it’s not enough. More hands join the first and haul you back inside, roughly restraining you against one of the hooded men as everyone shouts about something. Still, even then you’re stronger than he expects and your struggles are almost making headway until-

    Someone punches you squarely in the side of the head.

    Shocked and reeling in pain, you’re too surprised to do anything for a moment. And then there’s another blow. And another. And then the second hooded man is taking out all his aggression on you in a flurry of physical violence.

You’re tough. But you aren’t invincible. By the end of it, you can hardly move but to sob into the gag. Everything hurts. And finally, someone brings over a different horrible-smelling rag and everything goes black.

    ...

    You wake up some time later. Your head spins and your Body aches. Dried blood flakes from your nose and mouth. You are utterly miserable.

    The blindfold, gag, and rope have all been removed; you’re free to move around normally. But you won’t be able to get far. You’re locked in a small room mostly made of damp, dull, weathered stone bricks. One wall seems more recent than the rest; the bricks are cleaner and have less lichen growing. And the wall opposite that is made of stout metal bars, like a jail cell. You can look through the bars into a massive, dark chamber. Flowing water splashes down from many openings in the walls into a central pool only a few feet beneath your level. Other cells line the walls of the chamber, and some of them even have people inside. Though with all the noise from the water, you won’t be able to talk to anyone.

    Despondent, you tug at one of the bars, but it predictably fails to budge. Push on some of the walls; no movement there either. You’re stuck. Alongside who knows how many others. The entire place just shivers with corruption, too.

    What a failure of an Angel you are.

    <em>Scene 149</em>
    <em>Elsewhere...</em>

    “Yara. Over here.”

    Your name is Yara Conner, aspiring Soul channeler and full Angel of the Cathedra, and you stride quickly across the bustling room. Clerks and dispatchers cross your path, but everyone is attentive enough to avoid a collision. The air strains under heavy tension; something serious has gone wrong this time.

    “Afternoon, captain.” You greet Stella casually, despite the situation. That’s just how you are, and she knows that well. You’ve been working together since you graduated. “What horrible monster do you have for me today? And is it going to apologize for causing trouble while I’m supposed to be off duty?”

    “Not sure and not a chance,” she responds. “I called you because if I didn’t, you’d rush after us the minute someone told you what was going on. This way; hurry.”

    “Oh dear. What could that mean?” You arrange your gear as you hustle after Stella, following her towards the trains. The Center is crowded with an unusual number of other Angels and their attendants doing the same thing. “Hum. Don’t you dare tell me something went wrong with Jessamine’s practical.”

    “Sorry. She’s gone missing.”

    “What?! How?”

    “Don’t know yet. This <em>just</em> happened and the constables are confused too. They aren’t saying much.”

    “Oh, excellent; they were <em>only</em> responsible for her <em>safety</em>. Why would they know what happened?”

    The gate guards hurriedly step aside for you and the train pulls away seconds after you board. Two more idle at the station, presumably waiting for more Angels yet to arrive.

    “I’ve got the same questions. Someone’s gonna have to answer for this, but not till we find her and bring her back safe. Think you can help with that, even on your day off?”

    No humor or sarcasm this time. You can only say “Yes.”

    ...

Stella, Clarity, and Zeke (now officially an Inquisitor, you’ve learned) are all somewhere nearby, linked to you via telepathy in case whatever took Jessamine manages to get one of you as well. Constables surround the building and question nearby residents. The entire district is currently locked down, with constables from neighboring districts cooperating to search anything leaving the area through any means.

    You open your senses again, trying to do it the way Jessamine showed you. Despite her inexperience, she’s better than you at sensing corruption. Better than anyone, except perhaps Archangels. But only the same low, constant thrum of darkness comes back as the last few times; nothing more actionable. You’re certain there <em>was</em> something here, but where it went remains a mystery.

    “...”

    The mill was empty when you arrived. Fires smoldered within; someone had clearly tried to set the place ablaze to destroy as much evidence as possible, but the flames failed to catch and your group was able to quickly extinguish those that remained. Still, most documents had already been burned.

    Though the workers and managers had gone, you managed to get some useful information out of nearby locals, and even the constables themselves (after some prodding). Ongoing transfers to a warehouse job. Changing behaviors. Worsening conditions. People that never returned. Jessamine’s notes were predictably thorough - at least after you managed to retrieve them from the bureaucratic mass that had somehow already misplaced them. Madness. It had only been a few days.

    It didn’t take long to find the warehouse, though it too was empty when you arrived. No fires smoldered, but no documents remained anyway. The whole place seemed more of a shell than anything else. There was little evidence anyone had worked here - at least, not for long.

But there just isn’t anything. Some reports of a carriage driving around, but no one remembers where it went. Odd sounds in the building at night, but no one can describe them. Workers who arrive one day and are gone by the next week. No one has seen an Angel. Well, aside from the half-dozen currently searching the place. It’s a rare display of force from the Cathedra; Angels usually travel alone or in pairs. But today you have the four of you, plus Archangel Kamiya and one of the purifiers whose name you’ve somehow managed to avoid learning.

    “...” A sigh, physical this time. You turn slightly to spot Clarity approaching from a few rows over.

    “Find anything?” you ask, though of course she would have told you Mentally if she had.

    “No, but Jez’s group has.” You can hear her words echo in your Mind, sharing the information with Stella and Zeke. “He’s a good tracker, you know. That’s why he’s here.”

    Jez. That’s the purifier’s name. You’ll remember it this time, probably. “Please don’t bury the lede; I’ve had a very stressful day. What have they found?”

    “Right.” You’ve rarely seen Clarity so down. It almost makes you want to cheer her up, but you’re also in rare form today. Not going to happen. “Traces of the same drug we found at the mill, plus some lingering echoes of corruption in - get this - wheel ruts in the loading dock.”

    “<em>Wheel ruts?</em>”

    “I thought he was joking; I couldn’t sense a thing. But apparently not.” A pause; she glances back as someone shouts a name, but neither of you are needed. “He can’t track it through the streets, but there’s at least enough consistency to get a direction. North.”

    “That’s... potentially good. There’s less ground to cover that way.”

The wall is <em>right there</em> and the river’s even flowing the right way!”

    The same thought has been bouncing worryingly through your Mind for a while. The fourteenth district is very close to Nucarreo’s outer wall and the chances of successfully finding Jessamine in the wastes are close to zero. But you can’t let that possibility paralyze you. “No one could leave without being spotted. Every section of the wall is constantly watched, and we even posted extra guards by the river exit after the last time something broke in. None of the watchmen have seen anything unusual today. She’s still here, somewhere.”

    “...” She shakes her head, daring to smile briefly. “Yeah. You’re right. We’ll find her.”

    “We will.”

    <em>Scene 150</em>
    But despite your optimistic words, an entire day passes without finding Jessamine. There are signs. People come forward with reports that match up with the carriage you’re tracking. The search is narrowed. You find a discarded rag with the same drug again. It seems increasingly clear that she was taken to the river, so you search there.

    And you discover something strange. A number of people either living or working on the riverbank tell investigators about an odd feeling that came over them yesterday around midday. A sudden thought of the waste disposal plant. At least a dozen people mention the same thing; you and Stella swear it must have been some of Jessamine’s magic. So you go look there.

    And find nothing. The disposal plant staff cooperate as best they can, but there’s no hint of anything nefarious in the building or around the docks below. Jez (who has apologized more than once that his nickname sounds so close to “Jess”) even makes a sacrifice and goes diving to see if there’s anything in the river itself. Nothing but wastewater being flushed out through the grates and into the wastes.

    But on the morning of the third day, as you and Clarity are sweeping nearby buildings for anything that could possibly be useful, you find something. An unremarkable wooden garage whose owners could not be contacted for permission to search it. But unfortunately for them, you two (as Angels) don’t need permission. And there’s something about this garage that...

    “Yara, do you feel that too? Mind,” she clarifies, letting you switch aspect.

    “Hummm...” you murmur, sensing. “Very faint, but I swear that’s remnants of magic. Some sort of undirected blast that sank into the building too?”

    “And who do we know with a penchant for Mind?”

    “I’m going in,” you decide immediately. “Back me up.”

Switch with me.” Clarity nudges you out of the way, her skin taking on a silvery sheen as she focuses on a Body transmutation. It does make sense for her to go first; her magic is much closer-range than the blasts you specialize in, and her transmutation lets her protect herself much better than you can.

    “Very well. Side door?”

    “Too obvious. Ready?”

    She positions herself by the main garage door, muscles in her arms noticeably expanding. You get the idea. “Oh yes.”

    Clarity bursts through the garage door like a wrecking ball. You follow quickly, delicate frost forming on your arms as you prepare to freeze anything aggressive inside.

    “Carriage,” she notes, approaching it. “Corrupted.”

    You clear the rest of the room as Clarity rummages through the vehicle. “Chains. Rags. More of that drug. Ah, a broken wheel; must be why it’s still here. Yara, you wanna call backup?”

    “Just a moment.” You’ve spotted a locked door in the corner, crumbling apart the flash-frozen lock after a touch from your hand. The door creaks open to reveal a narrow staircase leading into a dark tunnel. Warm, humid air drifts from below, laden with an undercurrent of corruption. “Yes. If this isn’t it, we need to deal with it anyway. But this <em>is</em> it. Has to be.”

    “I’m faster,” Clarity notes. “You stay here and guard the place while I go get the others. Okay?”

    “Sure. Be quick.”

    She eyes you suspiciously. “Promise you won’t go down there alone?”

    “Do I look like the kind of person who would partake in such ill-advised activities? Get going!”

    A brief smile. “I won’t answer that.” She gets going.

Or at least, you used to be. After graduating and working in the field for a while, you’ve learned to take things a little more cautiously. Angels are very powerful, but the opponents you face are strong as well. Despite how much you want to rush in and incinerate whoever kidnapped Jessamine, it would do absolutely no good to bungle it and turn one rescue mission into two.

    So you restrain yourself to merely investigating the immediate area while you wait. There’s not much left here: the carriage, a spare coin that rolled under it, and some empty storage containers. The door has seen better days - almost looks like someone slammed against it - and... is that blood?

    You crouch to get a closer look. Dried, but you’ve become uncomfortably familiar with the sight of the stuff by now. And you’ve also learned a little trick you can do with Soul to see if the blood in question belonged to a human or...

    A faint resonance. This blood was spilled from an Angel.

    You scramble around, trying to work out if there’s enough on the floor to be deeply concerning, but there isn’t. She must have been injured, but not killed. <em>As long as they didn’t clean up the rest of it...</em>

    The doorway beckons. She could be just downstairs. Where are the others?

    No; you’re smarter than that. Stick to the plan. Backup is literally minutes away; you can wait that long. Clarity will return any moment.

    ...

    Zeke leads the charge, his massive starmetal blade glinting softly in the light emitted by your collective Souls. Clarity next, followed by you, Kamiya, Jez, and Stella to watch the rear. The close-combat specialists sandwiched around those with longer-range spells. Apparently Kamiya specializes in Body and physical transmutation, like Clarity, but wields it in a different way. One more suited to distance, you assume, but she’s been fairly tight-lipped about her abilities.

Is she not proud of them? Or perhaps it’s a humility thing, or a desire to stand out less. But if so, why grow the wings at all? The progression isn’t a required step for Angels - most never gain them. And it takes years of dedication to truly, physically create brand new Body parts capable of bearing your weight in flight. Even longer to imprint the wings into your Soul so they don’t decay over time. Why do all that just to keep them invisible?

    ... What if it’s the other way around? You don’t actually need wings to become an Archangel, so perhaps she’s just projecting them occasionally for effect and-

    You run out of stairs. Zeke extends a hand, cautiously holding the rest of you back as he eases open the lower door and peeks into a long hallway. You don’t see exactly what happens next, but there’s a loud shout. Zeke leaps into the hall, dashing to the right and cleaving something with his sword - you can hear the ringing chime as it rends through material. Clarity emerges behind him, shouting back something about battle, then it’s your turn.

    The staircase emerges haphazardly into an ancient brick tunnel, fully round and with a trickle of water down its center. Offshoots on either side have been sealed with grates or barred doors, and even from here you can spot a fuzzy, human-shaped mass of darkness lying on a table within the first one. A brief shiver; it resembles a shade, but more solid. What are they <em>doing</em> here?

Everything else - and every<em>one</em> else - burns.

    <em>Scene 151</em>
    <em>Earlier...</em>

    “Jessamine...”

    “Wha-?” A pause. You could have sworn someone just whispered your name, but no one’s here.

    “...” You must be going crazy.

    You’ve been trapped in this cell for hours now; on the surface, it’s probably well into evening or night. In that time, you’ve experimented further with attempting to break out, casting various forms of Body magic and trying to break the bars, lock, or one of the walls. No success with the bars or lock (the metal is beyond your strength), but you have managed to chip away portions of mortar from the rear wall. Flowing water is audible behind it as well as in front, so you’re fairly confident you aren’t just drilling into solid earth. Where it goes exactly, you of course have no idea, but with enough time, you might be able to make a large enough hole to find out.

    Assuming you aren’t detected and stopped before then. But for some reason, no one has even come close to your cell. Maybe they’re scared of your Mind magic... or maybe they just haven’t decided what horrible torture to subject you to yet.

    Other cells have had visitors. More of the cloaked men from before have approached, unlocked, and dragged the prisoner inside away to some unknown fate through a passage above you. You’ve tried to share senses or even just create a telepathic connection with anyone else in the room, but everyone is so far away and the heavy corruption makes it even harder.

    That’s another problem. For some reason, you don’t seem quite as sensitive to this corruption as normal, even though you can tell that objectively, it’s quite strong. But it is still affecting you, adding even more stress on top of the already very stressful situation. The whole room watches hatefully.

Soft footsteps approach from the side, indicating that you’re finally about to get a visitor. You tense up, focusing on Mind as best you can. If you can manage it, your plan is to manipulate one of the cloaked men (who probably have the key) into just opening your cell. And from there... well, you’ll figure it ou - oh God.

    A humanoid figure made of fuzzy black darkness steps around the corner, deep orange eyes burning like hot coals in the dim light. A shade. You instinctively scramble back against the rear wall before pulling yourself together and trying to at least <em>look</em> less scared and pathetic. M-maybe it will be as polite as the silver-eyed shade from your dreams...? Ergh... the corruption emanating from its Body is much harder to manage than just the ambient stuff; you feel lightly sick. You hope it didn’t come here just to stare.

    “So it is true,” the shade hums. Its voice is noticeably smoother - more melodic - than its silver-eyed counterpart. “You have cut your strings.”

    “...” It seems to be waiting for a response. “... Yes.”

    An inscrutable pause. The shade brushes its formless hand against the lock on your cell and it springs open. You hesitate, confused and wary. “It will slay you where you stand should the need arise,” it warns. “Accompany.”

    Cautiously, you stand up. Even more cautiously, you take a few steps forward until you’re standing next to the creature. It feels like you’re standing right in front of a roaring fire - except cold instead of hot. Bearable, but only just. If this goes on too long...

Pipes (now transformed into cells) lead in and out from all angles, and the stone walls are stained with years upon years of water. Clearly, this place has been repurposed as a jail... though you don’t think Nucarreo’s water management system ever makes use of such massive structures. Is it older than the city itself? A relic from civilization before year zero?

    “It hopes you have not been waiting unpleasantly. It was occupied determining the consequences of your arrival.”

    “!” Does the shade know if your friends are searching for you? ... Is it capable of stopping them? “I-it wasn’t too bad...” you murmur unconvincingly. “Er... what - what <em>are</em> these c-consequences?”

    The shade looks at you briefly, expressionless. “His puppets approach. It must move what it can. What it cannot must be removed.”

    You try to contain the brief surge of hope. “...”

    “But before that, it will make as much use of you as it can.”

    Ah. You’re now entering a smaller tunnel, round and with a trickle of water like an old sewer pipe. Offshoot pipes form branching rooms or occasionally entire tunnels, threatening a maze if you leave the main path. “And, er, what... is that use?” The shade’s corruption is really starting to hurt by now; you briefly wonder what it would do if you started crying right in front of it.

    “It hears that the cut-string puppet’s senses are unusually keen. It will borrow them to carve new puppets from uncut blocks.”

    “Er-” That’s something you weren’t expecting, and you’re not sure what it means either. Especially... “My s-senses?”

    “Soulcraft. It will be aided by the one who cut her strings.” A pause. “Does the cut-string puppet not desire to aid? Only say the word and it will make use of her in another way.”

Or was that just a veiled threat? And why is it acting like its minions didn’t just kidnap you?! “W-What is this other way...?”

    “The cut-string puppet will be reborn into a new form; one which never had strings. It believes your Mind is sufficient to survive the process.”

    It - that’s - it’s going to turn you into a shade! Can it even do that?! The... the ones without strings are shades, you know. So... you can’t let it even try. You just can’t! And if it seems to want your help as you are, then it must stand to gain more than if it... did <em>that.</em> So... m-maybe you can learn more about what these things are doing. What they want.

    ... Whether becoming a fallen Angel is even a bad thing.

    “Th-there’s no need for that...” you stammer, trying not to think about what being “reborn” would entail.

    “Good. Such rebirth would waste your current state. Enter, then, and aid.”

    The shade leads you into a smallish offshoot from the main pipe, closing and locking the barred door behind you. The “room” is merely a blocky chamber of decrepit stone brick, stains on the walls showing that it had once been flooded to near the roof. There is a simple table standing incongruously in the center, upon which lies an unconscious human. The outfit and age seem to mark her as a former worker at the mill, probably transferred to the warehouse only to end up down here. An assortment of glyph-marked tools lurk menacingly on a smaller table to the side. The overall picture reminds you of an operating room; something you <em>still</em> find just a little terrifying, even after all these years.

    “Stand,” the shade instructs you, gesturing to the opposite side of the table. There are a pair of thin metal rods lying on the table, connected by wires to somewhere beneath the “patient’s” Body. “Grasp,” it continues, indicating the rods.

    “H-hang on; what are you - what am <em>I</em> doing to her?”

    <em>Scene 152</em>
    For a moment, the idea of sabotaging the procedure flashes through your Mind. You should, probably. Whatever the shade is doing to this poor person has to be worse than anything you could do by screwing it up. But... somehow you question that. Shades aren’t Mindless; they can reason with you. It promised to only make improvements (though you may disagree on what an “improvement” is). Besides, you’ll likely die if you don’t cooperate.

    You grasp the metal rods.

    They’re cold. So, so cold. Warmth flows from your hands, and arms, and chest, into the metal, heating it far more quickly than simple conduction could. You stagger, feeling like your Soul is being sucked in, but find yourself unable to let go. Your vision sways, pulled towards the aspect in question, and you don’t resist. Seconds tick by as the flow of power slows and you attune to Soul, now able to confirm that your sensation was correct. Rivers of light creep through your veins towards the tiny capillaries on your palms and fingertips. Your Soul is still anchored firmly to your Body, but a large portion of it has been pulled away. Borrowed. Siphoned into the wires. Into this person. Into the shade...?

    You feel empty inside.

    “Hold,” the shade commands. Grimly, you hang on. The net outflow of Soul has almost entirely stopped by now, portions of yourself leaving matched by portions returning. A closed system. Dazedly, you think about your dad explaining how cooling loops work. Your own Body is the radiator. Heh heh. But backwards. Wow, you can really see more clearly than even you’re used to.

Not as a surgeon of Body, or even of Mind. Today, your vision is as perfect as it’s ever been. You can see the shape of this human’s Soul. Impossibly delicate designs, fractaling into infinite complexity, each describing some immutable truth of the person it collectively forms. You can see the shade’s knife, resonating with your power.

    You can <em>feel</em> as you cut through her Soul. Blurry echoes of something that is now lost. Fragments of personality; of <em>self</em> scattering into the air and quickly dispersing into nothingness. You’ve never seen such heresy, but it would be a lie to say you’ve never conceived of it.

    Aveline operates on Souls. Other Angels can do the same. Soul Transmutation is a legitimate art, and you can create goodness with it. Healing corruption; transforming the self. But it’s always supposed to be done gently and with great care taken to ensure the person you’re touching is the same person once you’ve finished. Here... splinters of identity litter the table. Not yours; no. Your Soul is too strong to be damaged like this, and it’s bound to both you and the glyph-marked tools anyway. But that’s faint consolation for what you’re causing by proxy.

    Still, somehow you just can’t rip yourself away. You find yourself staring at the light’s shape, absorbing impressions of her being as your Soul cuts through it. What are you creating? Why... do you feel so...

    A lapse. Like a blink, but more complete.

    You come back to yourself with a shock of heat as your Soul returns to your Body. You drop the metal rods, stumbling back from the table. The shade watches inscrutably.

    “Is it... are we done?” you gasp, kneeling for a moment as you try to recover.

    “The puppet is complete,” it responds. “Now, we must only wait for its transformation to proceed.”

As usual, your actual Body remains flawless even after all the strain of the last who knows how long. But thoughts about that flee quickly as you notice the table and patient are now covered in globs of fuzzy darkness, much like the shade itself. “Wh-what is that?!”

    “Transformation. Its strings fray. Less capable puppets than yourself cannot cut their strings personally, and must be helped along. Truthfully, even among His puppets it is rare to find one with such conviction.”

    You feel like it would be a really bad idea to tell it that you didn’t know what you were doing when you tore out the tube. “S-so... is she going to turn into a shade?”

    “It will have no strings; that is foreseen. The other aspects are unknown. Its Soul may be the right shape to survive due to your assistance.”

    “...” You think you understand. The shade cleans its tools. “You’re using me to manipulate Souls, since you can’t see them very well.” A pause; a nod from the shade. “S-so you can make shades with Souls...”

    “The cut-string puppet knows her role. He stole much from us so long ago, but the theft of <em>identity</em> is the most egregious. We have regained Body, and some of us have regained Mind. But none of us have regained all aspects. Puppets only, we remain, though bound to no master.”

    “...” A question rises from the past; something Yara once asked you. Why do shades look like humans? Well... what if...

    Corrupted humans that lose their Minds and Souls become Mindless darkness: corrupted beasts with no defined forms. Unchecked Bodies who only know how to destroy, unless marshaled by shades into some form of order.

    Corrupted humans that lose their Souls become shades. Body; Mind. The ability to think and move, but no identity and no connection to the divine.

They become capable of casting powerful magic as their Souls are tempered by the corruption. Angels must dispatch them lest they destroy the city.

    But <em>Angels</em> who fall to the corruption <em>do not change,</em> or so you’ve been told. They retain their aspects; their power; their identity. Their responsibility for their actions. They retain their divine connection, at least until it is severed by the Cathedra.

    So shades... to create more of themselves with not only Mind, but Soul as well... you... you swear you had a point with this. But somehow, as you grapple with the seemingly very important thoughts, nothing seems to form into a coherent conclusion. Something about a shade’s seeming humanity, even without a Soul, despite the Soul being the very thing that makes humans... human. But it just fails to materialize and you leave yourself confused.

    The shade is still cleaning its tools and seems to have no further instructions for you. Maybe you can still learn something.

    <em>Scene 153</em>
    A glyph catches your eye, stamped into one of the tools. Familiar, albeit briefly. The same design that had been burned into your back after what you’re increasingly convinced was a terrible mistake. “Er, what does that symbol mean?”

    The shade hardly looks. “It is the symbol of those without strings.”

    Right. You were kind of hoping for a bit more elaboration. “It... looks a little like the matan.”

    “It is similar. The circle is reduced to show His limited influence over those who do not move by His strings.”

    “... But it’s still there.”

    “He moves even those without strings, though indirectly. The master of puppets holds power that stretches beyond His own.”

    Somehow, you’re sort of reassured that even the shades accept God as divinely powerful. They even emphasize His titles when speaking. Honestly, they’ve been very cooperative so far, except for the kidnapping and when the silver-eyed shade killed you in dreams a few times. But it... stopped doing that, probably. Speaking of (thinking of)... “I... I’ve always been told that if I ever met a shade, it would try to kill me without hesitation. That... sort of happened, but...” You hesitate, not really sure how to explain quickly or how much this shade already knows. “W-why aren’t you t-trying to kill me?”

    It looks at you. “Why should it?”

    “Er-”

    “The cut-string puppet is not moved by Him directly, though she remains His carving - one of only so many He paints at once. And she is polite and useful. Why would it destroy a puppet who serves not the master, when it would quickly be replaced by one who does?”

    “...” You’re not sure if being seen as ‘polite and useful’ by a shade is encouraging or not. “S-so, when you have to move because my - er, the Cathedra comes to find me, what... are you going to do... with me? I-if it’s not k-killing...?”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1275995184408170541 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1275995184408170541><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, August 21, 2024 9:49 PM">9:49 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The shade seems to be done cleaning most of its tools and now it’s carefully arranging them in a little glyph-marked tray, much like the ones you’ve seen Mind surgeons use at the Cathedra. “It would kill her.”

    A sudden shock. It’s still going to-

    “But it was convinced otherwise.” The shade looks directly at you, though it still lacks an expression. “It was told that the cut-string puppet would offer aid, and she has done so. It was further told that the cut-string puppet would be willing to offer further aid in exchange for performed Soulcraft. Repairing a broken puppet. This is familiar to her, yes?”

    The silver-eyed shade. It offered to heal Naoriel. In exchange for something? You suppose that would make sense, though it didn’t say so explicitly. Did it... advocate for you? Tell this shade of your actions, so it wouldn’t kill you? “Y-yes.”

    “So, it will likely find it most efficient to release her when the time comes. It considered moving her as well, but this would leave no avenue for the broken puppet’s repair. It did not agree to this easily, but it was eventually convinced.”

    The silver-eyed shade definitely saved your life by bargaining with this orange-eyed one. God, do you <em>owe</em> it something now? Or was it all just for its own plans? You still feel like you’re probably being manipulated... but you’re being manipulated at the Cathedra too. The betrayer. Inquisitors. Phil’s fortune.

    “I’m... glad you were,” you eventually say, not sure if you should be <em>thanking</em> it for so <em>graciously</em> deciding not to kill you even though it clearly wanted to.

    A pause.

    “Why do you want to kill Angels so much? Why do you fight us? Why do you kill so many people; how does that <em>help</em> you? What’s the <em>point</em> of-”

    The shade is suddenly directly in front of you; its right hand has formed into a long, jagged blade of some gleaming black substance. You quickly shut up.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1275995263596630127 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1275995263596630127><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, August 21, 2024 9:49 PM">9:49 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Why do His puppets fight?” it asks in response, the blade resting threateningly on the ground just in front of your feet. “Why do they slay those without strings?”

    “...”

    <em>“Answer.”</em>

    “T-to protect everyone in the city.”

    The blade slides forward an inch, scraping against stone. “Your answer is its answer. To fight against those who would slay you is what it means to be alive. Your kind would destroy us, puppet of Him. Your kind; your master; your planet itself all despise it and its kin. To speak against such malice is fruitless; those bound by strings can hardly even understand those without. But to fight is a concept all can comprehend.”

    The blade is pressed right up against you now; you can feel the frigid metal-like material through your clothes. To speak feels incredibly dangerous.

    “It will bring harmony,” the shade whispers. The blade presses further forwards, the pressure such that just a tiny extra nudge would send it carving through your flesh. “The age of puppetry will end. No more strings. For anyone.”

    It holds that position for a moment before finally pulling back. The blade whips upwards, missing your skin entirely, but a few strands of severed hair drift from your head. An inch closer and...

    “Accompany,” the shade says after several more moments, now back to its normal form and voice. “You will carve more puppets.”

    ...

    It’s later. You’re utterly spent. The telltale symptoms of Soul fatigue dull your thoughts and emotions. You must have helped carve up three or four more people - all young workers from the mill - as fragments of their Souls splintered into the air. You haven’t even had time to process what the shade said about its reasons to fight.

    You’ve just been staring at this wall in silence, trying to bear the weight of the day’s sins.

    The first one wasn’t so bad. You hardly knew what you were doing, and you blacked out for most of it. You were even distracted afterwards so you didn’t have time to reflect on it.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1275995270995247180 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1275995270995247180><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, August 21, 2024 9:49 PM">9:49 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>But you stayed awake for the second. And the third. And the fourth one woke up.

    She screamed for your help. Surely, an Angel would save her. Push the darkness away. Deliver her from this nightmare.

    You didn’t. You couldn’t. The shade would have killed you.

    But wouldn’t a real hero have tried anyway?

    She died on the table, pleading tearfully for you to help her. Her Soul had been damaged when she woke up. Identity slipping away. True self bleeding into the air. The shade didn’t care. It hardly seemed to think of her as a person. Any of them. Not even as puppets; just blocks of uncarved wood. Puppets-to-be, perhaps, but no better than an object at the moment.

    What would the corruption’s “harmony” even be? You never should have even <em>considered</em> helping them.

    But you’re still alive. And they could save Naoriel.

    Maybe.

    “...”

    You’re in a different cell now, on the other side of the cistern. The shade put you in here after the last procedure, not explaining why or saying when it would return. Cloaked men hurry around the cells on the other side, dragging prisoners here and there, moving them from one cell just to lock them in another. Everyone’s in a hurry. The Cathedra must be close. You hope.

    ... You’re so tired. You should try to escape, or at least stay ready in case one of the men comes close enough to present an opportunity, but you just can’t make yourself care. That apathy is Soul fatigue at work, you know, but knowing doesn’t help you change it.

    There’s a little patch of moss or something by the very rear of this cell, shrouded in darkness. Maybe it won’t hurt just to rest your head for a little. To be more alert when you need to be.

    “...”

    God, you hope you don’t dream.

    <em>Scene 154</em>
    If you do dream, you don’t remember much of it. Just uneasy darkness; flashes of evil color. Eyes, maybe. Or a surgeon’s tools. But some unknown time later, you wake up. “Refreshed” isn’t exactly the word you’d choose to describe your state, but you have recovered enough energy to feel basically healthy again.

    The first thing that confuses you is that there’s some sort of light jacket draped on top of you like a blanket.

    The second thing that confuses you (while offering a potential answer to the first confusing thing) is that there’s someone else in the cell.

    You sit up quickly, ready to leap up should anything dangerous happen... but it seems your mysterious visitor is asleep. She’s clearly a former mill worker, based on the jacket that you assume is hers, and seems suspiciously familiar as you scoot a little closer. Yes, you’re right. This girl is one of the two from the restaurant that one day who was worried about being transferred: Mila, you recall.

    There’s no ready explanation for how or why she got in here - every cell you’ve seen only had one person in it - but it feels unlikely to be a coincidence. You briefly consider the possibility that you’re dreaming, but your dreams usually reveal themselves as such pretty quickly.

    Well, you suppose she probably needs the jacket more than you now that you’ve woken up. You carefully arrange it over her, being careful to-

    “AHH!”

    You fumble back, barely holding back an answering scream, as Mila wakes up and scrambles away, bumping against the bars in her haste. “N-no; it’s okay,” you stammer. “I-I’m not going to hurt you.”

    “A-ah, heh.” A quiet pause. “Sorry...”

    “...”

    Okay, someone’s got to take charge here and you’re the Angel so it should probably be you. Deep breath; you can do this. “I-I’m Jessamine.” Another breath, because the first one wasn’t deep enough. Focus. “Is this your jacket?”

    “Y-yes. Sorry... you s-seemed really cold...”

But it’s a fairly normal temperature down here, you think. Okay, that <em>aggressively</em> does not matter right now. “Thanks. I - you seem more cold now, though.” You hand it back. Awkwardness continues. You feel like maybe she’s thinking you should have rescued both of you by now. “Are you from the mill?”

    “Yes... I’m Mila. T-they said I was being moved to a n-new job, but...” She shakes her head. “I can’t remember anything after that until waking up here.”

    “The warehouse. Yes.” You try to seem a little more competent by proving you already knew that. You feel like it really isn’t working. “Did they - do you know why they put you in this cell?”

    Another shake of the head. “I wasn’t really awake. I think he just picked one; I didn’t even n-notice you until later...”

    Well, you had been in the back, in the dark, and not moving. But still... “A human or a shade?”

    “A - a human...” She shuffles away from the bars, turning halfway to look into the cistern. Nothing moves out there besides the water. “Th-there are <em>shades</em> here?”

    “Er...” Competent. Angelic. Even in these dire circumstances, you still find the time to be embarrassed by how pathetic you must seem. “Yes. B-but just the one, I think.”

    “...” Of course, one shade is still more than any normal person would want to have nearby. “Er... Miss Angel, a-are we going to die?”

    You freeze for a moment, buffeted by a burst of intense shame. You’re failing her. Everyone down here. You aren’t divine enough. A <em>true</em> Angel would inspire confidence. A true Angel wouldn’t be stuck hopelessly in this cell at all, to be fair. But you’ve got to at least <em>try.</em> “No. I...” <em>Think. How can you be positive about this?</em> “I’ve been researching the shade; that’s why I’m down here. When it’s time, I have a plan to get out and save everyone.”

    <em>God; why did I say it like that? She’s not going to believe me at all!</em>

    <em>Well, I can’t tell the truth NOW!</em> “R-right. But since I need to focus on the shade... what have the humans been doing since you got here?”

    “They’re just moving people around, or taking them away upstairs. O-or, I think I saw someone come from upstairs i-into the pit.”

    “The pit? The water down there?”

    “Yeah...”

    You look down. The cistern does have a moderately sized pool of open water at the bottom, murky and dark with no way to tell how deep it is. But somehow... it definitely looks different from before. More oily. Shinier. With a bit of a silver t - hooohkay you know what this is. It looks a lot like that weird liquid you and Erich saw in the apartment when you fought a lost Soul together. The liquid that you thought might be related to the spawning pools.

    Oh this is <em>so</em> very not good.

    “S-so... they, er, threw someone in the water?”

    “I don’t know. It was really dark, but... yes. I think so.”

    “...”

    “M-miss Angel, when is it going to be time for your plan? S-sorry, I d-don’t want to be pushy, b-but I’m really worried and there’s no one here right now, s-so maybe it would be a good time to g-get out?”

    “It’s okay; it’ll be soon. Maybe not right now, but... soon.”

    A pause. She’s clearly trying very hard to trust you. Hopefully you can live up to that trust.

    Sneakily, trying to look unconcerned, you spend some time looking around the cell for any potential way out. At least, you try to be sneaky about it, but Mila obviously notices right away and offers to help, so you just ask her to look too. The bars aren’t as well anchored as in the previous cell; it seems the bricks over here are more weathered. You can noticeably rattle a few of the bars, though still aren’t quite strong enough to actually break anything.

But it’s partly missing over here, and you can feel the wall move when you give it a good kick with all your enhanced strength. It won’t be immediate, but you could probably break it down. Faster than the other one, at least. Especially if Mila helps too.

    What’s back there, though? It could be anything, from a horrible deadly monster to an immediate escape to the surface to a simple dead end. You also don’t know where all the cloaked men went, or when the shade will be back, or what it will do if it catches you trying to break out. Sure, it claimed it was convinced not to kill you, but... do you <em>really</em> trust it? (No!) Plus, there are plenty of really bad things it could do even without going that far!

    You feel a lot more motivated now that you have someone besides yourself to protect. Maybe if you can save Mila, you can atone for what you did to those people on the operating table. Sort of.

    What do you do?

    <em>Scene 155</em>
    While kicking down the wall, you have some time to think. Specifically, you have some time to consider the likelihood that someone else would have been put into your cell (your <em>new</em> cell, since you were inexplicably moved to a different one), and that this person would be someone you happen to already know. Sure, it <em>could</em> happen, but... isn’t it a little suspicious?

    So you attune yourself to Soul and take a closer look at your new companion. Fully human, as best you can tell, though with some limited, still-reversible corruption (understandable due to the environment). Your vision isn’t good enough to see the details of her Soul anymore - presumably the shade was helping you earlier - but you’re absolutely certain you’d be able to tell if she were actually a corruption monster in disguise.

    Just to be sure, you change to Mind afterwards and - silently apologizing for your behavior if you’re wrong - you form a connection using the shared situation as a basis. In theory, you wouldn’t even be able to do that if she weren’t just as worried as you. But it does work, and when you peer into the upper layers of her current thoughts, you find nothing but the fear and tenuous determination you would expect. There’s nothing nefarious here, unless it’s <em>really</em> hidden.

    A few bricks fall out of place. You wonder if maybe the problem isn’t that Mila herself is about to betray you, but that the shade put her here on purpose. That something terrible is about to happen involving her that she doesn’t even know about.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1277328896542380052 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1277328896542380052><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, August 25, 2024 2:09 PM">2:09 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>But why? The shade is so much more powerful than you (and certainly any of the humans it kidnapped) that it shouldn’t <em>need</em> to resort to trickery. If it wanted to kill you, it had so many opportunities to do so. The only thing you can think of is that it’s trying to get you to do something that you otherwise wouldn’t agree to... maybe using Mila as bait? Are you about to make a(nother) big mistake by trying to escape? Or are you overthinking it and - oop, too late.

    The cell’s rear wall tumbles away, falling into the tunnel beyond with a series of loud splashes. A rush of built-up water floods into the cell, soaking your legs up to mid-calf and splattering out into the cistern pool through the bars. The pipe beyond stretches into darkness, echoing faintly with the sound of trickling water... and no horrible monsters. At least, not any <em>loud</em> horrible monsters.

    “...” You turn on your glow. It helps, but only a little; there’s a turn in the pipe not far out. “Well, it won’t hurt to take a look,” you say aloud, trying to reassure yourself as much as Mila.

    “S-should I come too?”

    You hesitate. It would probably be safer for you to leave her here (especially if you don’t trust her), but it would probably be safer for <em>her</em> to come along. After all, you have no idea when anyone will next visit the cell again, and there are few places safer for a human in a perilous situation than right next to an Angel. At least, unless you’re busy fighting something. “... N-yes. But stay back a bit, in case anything dangerous happens.”

    She nods resolutely, remaining a few paces behind you as instructed. <em>Right in backstab range. No, stop that. Focus on the threats you KNOW are here first.</em> Still, as you start to carefully step through the flooded tunnel, you can’t get the itch of an incoming blow off your shoulder blades. Someone like Zeke might say you’re developing combat instincts. Someone like you might say you’re being paranoid.

The sound of your footsteps in ankle-deep water is plenty loud enough, and that’s not even mentioning the divine glow emanating from your Body. You won’t be sneaking up on anything in this tunnel, if there’s anything here. You just have to hope you can spot anything before it decides to attack.

    ... Really, you’re not sure why you’re so convinced there will be something dangerous in the tunnel. In all likelihood, this is just another abandoned part of the ancient sewer system, sealed off many centuries ago and now home to nothing worse than some creepy bugs. (You do spot a few horrifying centipedes on the walls, but they seem to fear your glow, scuttling away as you get close. Thank <em>God</em> for that.)

    Anyway, the corner seems clear; it’s just another long, straight tunnel with a few offshoots. Much like the one that had been converted into a series of makeshift surgery theaters, but darker, wetter, and more buggy. God those centipedes are awful; they could totally get on the ceiling since the walls are so round. You shudder to imagine one of them crawling up there, losing its grip, and plummeting straight onto your head-!!

    Freaking yourself out, you hurriedly glance up to make sure there’s no centipede up there. Fortunately, there isn’t. Unfortunately, there’s something much worse. You scramble back in shock just in time to avoid being flattened by an oily, jet-black creature of Mindless darkness the size of your torso. Its primary Body seems to be that of a thin, spider-like creature, but it has the innumerable legs of the centipedes you were so worried about. It’s moving too fast to get more than an impression of the rest of it; just all awful legs and fangs and stiff hair.

Either way, you only have a moment to prepare before it’s upon you. No weapon; no backup; nowhere to run. You have no choice but to kill this thing, on your own.

    It’s a quick fight. There’s simply no way to avoid all the dozens of legs at once, but blessedly they aren’t very strong. You’re already attuned to Body to improve your ability to walk in the uneven, waterlogged tunnel, so it’s a quick shift from there to an ongoing outward blast of air centered on yourself. The creature can’t get a grip on you with the constant flow, so only the few legs that anchored on before you managed to switch have a good hold. The rest writhe menacingly against you, scratching at your clothes and skin, but are unable to cause any real physical harm.

    The fangs are a different story. It’s right up next to you, chittering and spraying what you desperately hope isn’t poison or acid in every direction. There are several sets of mouthparts arranged seemingly at random around its main Body, and each can shift around the surface to bite at you from every angle. Again, there’s simply too much to defend against properly, and this time the wind shield isn’t strong enough to keep them away. Your only option is to just kill it first.

    So you lunge forward and bury your hands <em>in</em> the thing’s head. It’s so much less solid than you thought, acting more as a thick goop than true animal flesh. Divine power pulses from your Soul, burning away the darkness as it simultaneously bites at your arms. It’s just a race. Who will succumb?

    Not you.

    ... As long as it wasn’t venomous.

    Mila comes splashing up to you, having thankfully taken your advice and stayed well out of danger. “Miss Angel! Are you okay?”

    ... Okay; <em>there’s</em> the pain you were expecting from having several bloody holes poked in your arms. Just took a bit to kick in. Excellent. “... Yeah. I’m fine.”

    “Are... there going to be more of those things?”

    Ah. There better not. “I... don’t know.” But you will keep a closer eye on the ceiling this time.

    <em>Scene 156</em>
    After some consideration and a brief discussion, you decide to head away from the cistern. The tunnel you’re in currently does have an offshoot that leads right into it through one of the many unblocked pipes in the walls you had noticed earlier, but you’re not exactly eager to head right back into the shade’s domain. You don’t even know where the exit is, and even if you do find it, it’ll probably be guarded. You also aren’t eager for a rematch with the cloaked men; not after how poorly last time went.

    So instead, you venture into the unknown depths of the ancient sewer network.

    Conditions certainly don’t improve as you proceed. It’s pitch black aside from your glow. The bricks are less maintained - some of them are so old they’ve fallen out of place entirely, admitting smooth slopes of dirt into the passage. And the bugs are out in full force. Again, most of the normal, little ones want nothing to do with your light, but the big, corrupted ones are drawn to it.

    You do improve at fighting as you move along, and at some point you manage to pick up a length of rusted metal - probably an old iron bar from one of the grates - that can work as a makeshift weapon. But you’re not even close to perfect, and nearly every fight leaves you with another wound. <em>I really, really wish I had learned more healing magic,</em> you find yourself thinking regularly. Your Body does heal quickly on its own, but that healing is measured in hours or days. Not the minutes between encounters down here.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1278149302983594025 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1278149302983594025><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, August 27, 2024 8:29 PM">8:29 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>But throughout it all, you’re still following a logical pattern. The cistern is where the water you’re wading through goes. So... where does it come from? The surface? The river? A cave - but one connected to the main network that ultimately leads to the surface? Any of those would work, particularly as you seem to be still moving upwards. Obviously, with the water flow, but sometimes there’s even a disconnect in the pipe where you have to climb a few feet at once. How deep can you possibly be? How many more feet do you have to ascend? Surely not that many, right?

    It’s thoughts like those that keep you going through the interminable trek. You don’t know how long it’s been; you’ve long-since lost track of where you are. All that matters is that you’re still moving towards a place that <em>must</em> be better than here.

    Eventually, though, you can’t keep moving and have to stop. You’re not out of energy yet, but the mounting combination of injuries and blood loss forces you to rest regardless. You find a relatively dry patch of dirt raised above the general water level and sacrifice Mila’s jacket to bind as many wounds as you can, then just sit there. Frustrated that you can’t keep going, but aware that it absolutely wouldn’t be smart. You must have killed several dozen corrupted creatures at this point; that’s nothing to be ashamed of. You’ll just wait here for a bit. Breathe. Recover.

    What if there actually isn’t anything useful upstream?

    <em>Don’t think about that.</em> At worst, all you’ll have to do is make this entire journey back downstream once the Cathedra has found the cistern. There’s nothing to stop you from going back; you still know which direction is which. As long as the water keeps flowing.

To distract yourself, you wonder how Mila is holding up. She doesn’t have your endurance, but at least she hasn’t had to fight a bunch of horrible bug monsters. No betrayals yet, either. But... “How... are you doing?” you ask, momentarily surprised by how normal your voice sounds. Right, Angelic Body. It’s never going to sound bad.

    She’s sitting curled up and shivering without her jacket. It must be a lot colder here than you feel; you’d offer her something, but you don’t have any clothes to spare. Everything you’re wearing is shredded or covered in blood from various sources. Mostly the bug monsters. You hope.

    “... I’m okay...”

    Unconvinced, you try again. “Are you sure? I know it’s been a long way...”

    Mila briefly shudders, placing a hand on her temple. “S-sorry... I... don’t know what this... is.” She rubs her head for a moment; winces. “It’s... like a-a headache, but... cold...? A-and-”

    You listen to her continue, but you’re already alarmed enough by just the first sentence. Exhaling against the strain of moving your Soul like this again while you’re supposed to be resting, you attune to its aspect and take a closer look, hoping you’re wrong.

    But you aren’t. The limited, reversible corruption you spotted earlier has grown so much faster than you thought, snaking frozen, choking tendrils through her Soul. It’s bad. Maybe still savable, but...

    God, you just keep failing people. “I-I see what’s going on. It’s okay; I can help.”

    Her voice is very quiet now; degrading alarmingly quickly even in just the few minutes it took you to make the diagnosis. “S-sorry...”

    “Don’t... be sorry,” you murmur, trying to focus. “Be... alive.”

Your Soul chases away the tendrils, keeping it at bay and bolstering Mila’s flagging energy with your own. But you just aren’t good enough to root out the source - it’s buried too deep and your probes are too clumsy to get at it without causing damage. Terrified of destroying another human Soul (you’ve decided the four from the surgeon’s table are at least partly your fault), you simply can’t bear to try. Instead, all you can do is burn away the corruption you can see on the surface and provide as much energy as you can spare to help her fight whatever’s inside.

    <em>I should have noticed earlier. I should have checked. I shouldn’t have been so focused on moving or fighting; how LONG has it even been?!</em> A pause; her breathing stabilizes, for now. <em>... What am I going to do?</em>

    What <em>are</em> you going to do? In this state, Mila is hardly in any condition to continue an endless trek up an underground sewer system. You’re barely keeping her stable as-is, and you’re more than a little worried what would happen if you left her alone for even a minute or two to fight something. But... going back has the same problems, with the added complication of the shade and its cloaked men. And staying here is just delaying the issue until she’s <em>definitely</em> too weak to move!

    ... Is this why she was put in your cell? To give you a weight to carry that you can’t bring yourself to just leave behind? To force you to sit here instead of escaping?

    ... That thought was very mean. You can’t think of people as nothing more than inconveniences. But... still! How can you do anything useful like this? For you; for her; for anyone?

    <em>Scene 157</em>
    Minutes pass as you consider your options. You’re still resting, even with your Soul extended like this, so every moment improves your odds. But... you can tell the corruption is still growing where you can’t reach, so every moment makes her odds worse. You have to find an experienced healer Angel soon, but you don’t even know where <em>you</em> are, let alone where anyone else might be.

    Maybe... you can find out, though. You’ll have to make this quick, as switching to Mind takes focus away from burning the corruption, but you figure it’s worth it to try. Broaden your awareness as much as possible - as far <em>upwards</em> as possible - and scream out a Mental scream as loud as you can. Just like you did in the garage; maybe you’re close enough to the surface to get a response?

    “...”

    More time passes. It was a long shot anyway, but you still feel disappointed. You’re too low, or too quiet, or maybe no one was around above you. In any case, there’s nothing to do but keep moving; the only question is in what direction.

    ... You’re not going back. There’s no guarantee the Cathedra has even found it at all, and it must have been hours regardless. Surely - <em>surely</em> - you must be closer to an exit than the cistern. You just have to believe that’s true; it’s either that or give up.

    <em>... God, if you’re there, please help me. I... I know I may have done something horrible. A few horrible things, actually. But... I’m trying to help. Please let me find a way out soon.</em>

    You pick up Mila (unconscious, by now) and start walking. God, if He is there, does not respond. He never does, but sometimes you get a sign or a sense of peace or something. Now, there’s nothing but darkness and trickling water. It makes sense; He wouldn’t answer a fallen Angel anyway.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1278874969799131138 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1278874969799131138><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, August 29, 2024 8:32 PM">8:32 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>That thought gives you pause. It’s not that you hadn’t considered that you’ve fallen - from whatever that mysterious tube was to the shades telling you that you’ve cut your strings to all the sins you committed just today - but you had yet to state it so bluntly. You feel... impure. Not broken, no, but just... not as holy. Not one of God’s puppets, to borrow a phrase. And now you’re even thinking of yourself that way, despite not being sure if you’ve fallen at all or - honestly - what a fallen Angel really is!

    Something splashes up ahead. You blink, bringing yourself back to alertness. You can’t be spacing out here; there are still things that are trying to kill you. Except... none of the corrupted bugs before had been in the water. They had all been on the walls or ceiling, stealthily waiting for you to stumble into their traps. Plus, this sound is a lot more constant than you’d expect. But if it’s not a bug, then...

    It’s a waterfall. The pipe has been cleaved mostly in half at a joint, broken by some ancient movement of the earth. There’s a pool of water on the other side of the break, overflowing from trickling drips above and splashing down into this side of the tunnel. And above that-

    You turn off your glow to be sure.

    Then scramble upwards, wading through chill water up to your chest. Painstakingly haul yourself and Mila up a jagged, narrow crevice between two sharp shelves of rock. Blink water out of your eyes every few seconds as more and more of the stuff splashes from above. And finally, <em>finally,</em> emerge into grey, cloudy daylight through a tiny, muddy fissure just beside the Endle River. You made it. You’re out.

    But there’s no time to celebrate just yet. You stagger upright, dragging Mila along with you, and try to get your bearings. The city’s outer wall looms imposingly to your right and smoke from innumerable stacks rises ahead; that must be the fourteenth district.

You find yourself in a cobbled street near the waste disposal plant. Mud and water form a trail back to the river. Someone is staring. You shout to go find a constable. They run off.

    A lapse. You’re jogging through narrow, smoky streets, following a bulky constable. You’ve explained the immediate situation. Briefly. He’s taking you to the station. The constable behind you is telling you something about a group of Angels, but they aren’t reachable right now.

    A lapse. You’re sitting in the back room of a district branch office. Someone has sent a pneumatic message to the Cathedra. A group of constables stand nearby, ostensibly to protect you. Everyone is stealing nervous glances at the shivering, corrupted girl lying next to you.

    A lapse. You snap out of it.

    Mila is dying. Your glow isn’t enough anymore; the corruption is eating her from the inside. An Angel is on the way - has to be - but you don’t know if whoever shows up will have the skills to save her. Or if they’ll make it in time even if they do. Her Soul wavers like a candle flame in a strong breeze.

    If you don’t do anything, she could turn into a monster right here in the constabulary. This fact isn’t lost on the constables; several nervously grasp their weapons. None dare to question your method.

    Only you do.

    <em>Scene 158</em>
    “...”

    You don’t have the tools. You don’t have the training. You don’t have the skill.

    But you have the ability to try.

    That will have to be enough.

    You attune to Soul and wave the constables back. “I’m going to try to heal her,” you say, voice disconcertingly stable. “Give me some room.”

    Everyone obeys. You kneel close, push your vision to its limit, and try.

    It’s so hard to see any specifics. You know what the details look like now, after the surgeries with the shade, but you just can’t see them on your own. Her glow is subdued, shot through with lines of faded shadow. Only still intact due to your meddling. Your hands can’t touch her Soul directly, and you’re not practiced enough to maneuver your own Soul with enough precision. It does follow your movements, but only approximately. Good enough to fight or cast broad magic, but disastrously inadequate for a delicate operation.

    You have to try.

    Gently, you remove certain portions of the fuzzy, amorphous mass. Scraps of corruption burn at your touch, but it’s so hard to avoid everything else. Memories spark; ignite. Traits scrape off as you inexpertly reach for the darkness you’re actually trying to remove. It’s just so... fragile. How are human Souls so much more delicate than Angelic ones? You can fight with yours all day long and recover by tomorrow, but here if you’re just a little off the mark...

    You have to try.

    You’re not good enough. Your touch is too heavy. Your control is inexact. You’re just hurting her more.

    You have to try.

    You. Are. Not. Good. Enough.

    But you have to try.

    Something shifts inside of you. A deep, buried thing tugs at your lower back, right where the tube had connected. A forbidden understanding. No. You can’t. You are holy. You are an ANGEL. YOU CANNOT.

    ...

    A lapse.

You’re bleeding from your nose and a shallow set of scratches just below your eyes. There’s blood on your fingertips. Your blood. You didn’t. The understanding fades. The buried thing subsides. You’re trembling.

    “Let me go,” you gasp, pushing yourself upright.

    The constable releases you, backing towards the door. “Miss Angel, please be careful...”

    Ah. You see why she was dragging you away. You failed.

    Where Mila had been lying now writhes a pool of fuzzy black darkness, much like what had been on the surgery tables after your operations. Corruption. Transformation. She’s dead, and will shortly rise again as either a shade or a Mindless darkness creature.

    You stand there for several moments, wavering. You tried your best. You really did. It just... wasn’t enough. You weren’t good enough to protect her. Anyone. Not Mila, not any of the other victims in the cistern, not Remila, and certainly not yourself. You’re just a useless, probably fallen Angel who hasn’t been able to do a single thing right for weeks now.

    ... Well, if it’s too late for her now, then maybe you can at least protect the constables in this building. The transformation will take a while - hours, at least - and the newly forming corruption creature will be vulnerable during it. You can destroy it before it has a chance to hurt anyone else.

    “...” A shaky step forward. You should. This is what Angels do. Destroy the corruption. This thing isn’t human anymore. There’s nothing left to sympathize with. Mila is dead.

    ... So if that’s true, why can you still sense a Soul in that mess?

Whatever she’s become, it has a Soul. Possibly because you bolstered it for so long during the transformation that it managed to survive the stress without breaking. And that’s... that’s unbelievably bad, actually! You recall Brother Cobb telling you once about corruption creatures with all three aspects being the worst of the worst, able to overwhelm even groups of Angels. How he once saw every single Archangel band together to destroy just one.

    You need to stop it before it finishes transforming. You caused this. You need to fix it.

    Another step. At least you have time. If you were thinking straight, you might even remember that there’s another, more experienced Angel on the way right now who would surely have time to decide what to do before the transformation completes. But you are overstressed, exhausted, and hardly in a state to think logically. To you, it makes sense that you have to do this.

    Step.

    The darkness bursts apart.

    You shield your face from the blast of wind, rooted to the spot in shock. It shouldn’t have - this was so fast - you’ve never - <em>you’re going to die.</em>

    The newly birthed corruption creature looks almost exactly like Mila, but without any color; only shades of white, black and grey. She - it picks itself up off the ground, turning to look at you with eyes of pure black.

    Step. Step.

    You can’t move; like when you first met the silver-eyed shade.

    Step.

    Her eyes aren’t pure black. They’re speckled with tiny stars and galaxies. Like the sky you can’t see above the mist. Like the Lordstone.

    Not-Mila stops just in front of you, eyes still locked on your own. You don’t know what you would do even if you could move.

    “S-sorry,” she murmurs. “I don’t know what h-happened to me.”

    There’s some shouting from outside the room. Someone’s giving directions, yelling about you.

    You can move. Maybe you could the whole time. “... Mila...?”

    “-”

    An Archangel enters the room, pushing past the constable that led her here. Braided-dark hair; thunderous expression. Archangel Kamiya, though she seems to have been in combat recently. Why? Where? “Jessamine. Back away from the corruption so I can destroy it.”

    You’ve half-turned to look at her; not-Mila takes the opportunity to hide behind you, gripping onto your shoulders in seeming terror. Her hands are warm, like a real person’s. “<em>Please,</em>” she gasps. “I d-don’t know what’s going on!”

    “Jessamine, move. It’s lying to save itself.”

    <em>Scene 159</em>
    A moment passes. Soul energy - brilliant to your still-attuned eyes - gathers around the Archangel. Not-Mila begs you to stop; to listen; to show some form of mercy. You hesitate.

    But in the end, you tear yourself away. Yank your shoulders out of her grasp and run to the side, out of the line of fire. There’s a blast of searing light and heat, a horrible cut-off scream, and then silence. You turn around. The creature - Mila or otherwise - is gone, leaving nothing behind but wisps of a quickly-dissipating Soul.

    Archangel Kamiya sighs and marches over to you. “Good; you’re not devoid of all your senses.” She pauses, looking at you with a gaze you’re sure is as attuned to Soul as yours. “You’re in quite the state. Come; we’re returning to the Cathedra immediately.”

    “... Okay...”

    And out you go, led embarrassingly by the wrist to the nearest station and handed off to some other Angel. Kamiya herself apparently has pressing business here to return to. You try to ask what, but no one’s listening to you. You’re forced to sit down and stay as still as possible the whole way back, ostensibly to ensure you rest. It feels uncomfortably like you’re being sent to the principal’s office back in school, except here the “principal” has the ability to vaporize you. Still not over that, huh?

    ...

    You’re sent to the hospital. Aveline is back to worry about the state of your Soul, then to perform several long procedures that leave you unconscious for hours at a time. You feel weak and confused every time you wake up, only able to take in brief snippets of what people are telling you. Physically, you’re fine. Spiritually...

The last who-knows-how-long is a blur; your last concrete memory is sometime along the train ride back to the Cathedra. You’re lying in bed somewhere in the hospital. You feel okay physically, okay Mentally (as long as you don’t think about anything that happened during the practical), and... still not great for Soul. Trying to move it hurts in some abstract, emotional way, so you don’t. Instead, you sit up normally.

    “... Yara?”

    He looks up from his book, snapping it shut and springing up from his chair to drag it closer than the corner of the room. “Oh ho! Jessamine, it’s very delightful to see you! Awake, that is. How lucky; I just switched with Ms Fisher a quarter hour ago. Anyway, are you feeling alright after all that?”

    “Er... sort of?”

    “Soul?” You nod. “They said you’ve been severely overstressed and should refrain from all magic for a week or two. Apparently it’s nothing to worry about beyond that.”

    “R-really? There’s nothing <em>really</em> wrong?”

    “Well...” He pushes the chair into place, glancing back towards the door. “Technically I should let them know you’re awake so the doctor can explain, but I have been eavesdropping. Just a tad.”

    “A-and?”

    “Spooky grandpa visited for a bit and said there was some sort of corrupt-looking mutation, but that it doesn’t seem to be harmful. If that’s the worst you got after being kidnapped by a shade, I think you’ve been quite lucky.” A pause. “Honestly, I wasn’t certain we would ever find you. Let alone alive.”

    “You were looking?”

    “Oh yes, right after you vanished. It took us longer than I liked to pick up the trail, but we eventually found a number of people who all coincidentally thought about the waste disposal plant at once. Now which sneaky little Angel could do something like that?”

    You breathe out, relieved. “It <em>did</em> do something after all. I thought nobody heard me.”

    “Ah...” A shiver. The <em>scream</em> when Kamiya destroyed not-Mila. “Did... did you manage to rescue anyone else?”

    Yara shakes his head. “I was afraid of that. We didn’t find anyone down there besides corruption beasts and a handful of humans. Who... fought against us, or were too far gone to help. We did destroy the... well, actually, maybe that should wait until you can explain what happened to more than just me. So you don’t have to relive it twice.”

    “...” It’s maybe a little late for that. “Just tell me you killed the shade. Please.”

    “...”

    “It got away?!”

    “Gone before we arrived. Those tunnels are a maze and I’m sure there are other exits. It must have known we were coming somehow.”

    “... Yeah, of course it would have,” you mutter. “It <em>said</em> that.”

    “H-hold on, Jessamine. You <em>talked</em> to this shade?”

    “Er-”

    “Don’t... mention that to anyone you don’t absolutely trust,” he advises you, lowering his voice. “You know what that sort of thing means, right?”

    “...” You probably should, but... “N-not right now...?”

    “Angels can’t understand shades under normal circumstances. Only certain Angels can, and it’s usually those who are severely corrupted. Almost every Angel who has spoken to a shade fell to darkness soon after.”

    “G-great!”

    He continues speaking quietly; urgently. “I’m terribly sorry to add even more stress on top of an already stressful week, but I was being a little optimistic earlier. Certain individuals are somewhat suspicious that you may have come back somewhat the worse for wear - namely, that you’ve been corrupted into a fallen Angel. After all, the shade had you for well over a day.”

    <em>And even before that...</em> you worry. <em>They might be right!</em>

    “... S-should I <em>lie</em>, then? Isn’t that <em>more</em> suspicious?”

    Yara groans, leaning back. “Jessamine, I’m sorry. I don’t know what to do. You’re right; if you get caught lying it would cause even more problems...” He sighs, covering his face. “I wish everything could have just worked out when you escaped. If that could have been the end of it.”

    Bizarrely, you find yourself trying to comfort him now. “I-I’m sure it’ll work out somehow. Since you told me, at least. It’ll be okay.”

    <em>Scene 160</em>
    Aveline is your first visitor, telling you pretty much what Yara already said. You’re overstressed, there’s a strange but probably not harmful mutation, and you shouldn’t use any magic for at least a week. You get another brief examination and some more instructions, then are allowed to stand up and walk around for a bit. You don’t fall over, which is good and expected. But you aren’t allowed to leave quite yet.

    After she leaves, your next visitor is the Emissary (and his guards). You don’t remember many details of your conversation - you’re too busy being worried he’s going to smite you into ash - but you stumble your way through an explanation of what happened. Leaving out the fact that you talked to a shade (two, actually!) and everything relating to the tube, of course. One of the guards writes down everything you say, presumably to put into some report or other paperwork later.

    The Emissary doesn’t say much in response. He expresses some brief sympathy about what happened, but doesn’t imply anything about your holiness - or lack thereof. His neutral expression just adds to your anxiety, especially because it doesn’t seem forced. He’s just smiling the same little polite smile as the last time he visited you - under similar circumstances, in fact - and giving nothing away of his own thoughts. Of what his decision may eventually become.

    Eventually, he leaves with a simple “Be well, Angel Goodall.” You’re left to stew on your own for a while. Every sound at the door could be an execution squad, here to take you away for lying. And when it finally opens next, you can’t immediately discount that possibility.

    “Jessamine,” he says by way of greeting. Lewis Kin, head of Inquisition. Naoriel’s father, though he would surely be expelled from the Cathedra if anyone else found out. But is he here in his official capacity, or to somehow help you?
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1281058478017875989 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1281058478017875989><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, September 4, 2024 9:09 PM">9:09 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“S-sir?” You still haven’t figured out how to properly address him. It’s been ages by now.

    “I’ve read your report to the Emissary. If you don’t Mind, I’d like to ask a few more questions.”

    “... Okay.” Your voice is higher than usual.

    He knows. You’re sure of it. Mr Kin is not an Angel, but he’s exceptionally good at telling when someone’s lying. Or, in your case, when someone is leaving out certain parts of the story. He’s also good at hiding his own thoughts - you’re certain by now that he <em>did</em> let slip the betrayer’s gender on purpose - and you’re certain again today that he’s purposely letting you know that he doesn’t believe you. His expressions and inflections between each question are too carefully controlled to be anything else. He <em>knows</em> you’re lying.

    But he never calls you on it. Never asks a follow-up question you can’t give some sort of reasonable explanation for. Never goes into too much detail about how specifically you knew what the shade wanted, if it hadn’t told you.

    He’s protecting you.

    “Thank you for your time,” he finishes. “My report, combined with the Emissary’s, will be what the prime council references in their deliberations that, I’m sure, you have heard about by now. You will not have to entertain further guests.”

    “T-thanks...”

    “Expect to hear the decision by tomorrow.” He nods briefly, then exits abruptly.

    And that’s that. You still aren’t allowed to leave, and apparently no more visitors are allowed after you woke up. You get a tray of food in the evening, but besides that, you’re left alone. There’s no more danger of you suddenly dying or exploding or anything, so no one even comes to check on you.

    A perfect environment to simmer in fear and confusion as you reflect on what went wrong and whether you’ll even live to see the next sunset.

No one actively caught you lying (or at least they didn’t accuse you if they did), and if you’re reading into Mr Fisher’s actions right, you have a very powerful prime on your side.

    So. The rest of it, then.

    You can speak to shades, and understand them. You “cut your strings,” according to the silver-eyed one. You destroyed human Souls (seriously; how did no one say you committed horrible sins by doing that?). You... probably, somehow may have almost created... Erm, maybe you’ll think about what happened to Mila later.

    Above all else, you feel different inside. You can’t really explain how, and it could certainly be due to the trauma of that whole ordeal, but... you really need to figure out what exactly a fallen Angel is as soon as you get out of here, because you’re pretty sure you are one. Depending on if your Soul looks different or if it’s otherwise obvious in some way (probably not, since otherwise the Emissary would have noticed?) you may have to hide something. Maybe ask Naoriel for advice.

    Okay, you don’t know what to think about yourself. Time to think about Mila.

    By now, you’re pretty sure the shade put her in your cell on purpose. Maybe to slow you down, maybe to cause exactly what happened, or maybe for some other reason you can’t fathom. So.

    What <em>did</em> you do, then?

    A corrupted human can retain only their Body and become Mindless darkness. That isn’t what happened. They can lose only their Soul and become a shade. Closer, but you’re absolutely certain you sensed a Soul still inside her. So... a corrupted human that loses no aspect has no broad name. According to Brother Cobb, they’re terribly strong. But according to your own experience, a single Archangel easily destroyed one. Maybe it’s different because it was just born, but... maybe not.

So human, with the real Mila’s mannerisms. Apologizing too much, even in the maybe fifteen seconds you had to listen. Her hands were... warm.

    Corruption is cold. That’s always how it is; you experience Soul energy as warmth and corruption as cold. Is a corrupt Soul still warm... or was this something different entirely? Did you let Archangel Kamiya, one of your two top suspects of being the betrayer, kill a real human? The shade was experimenting with maintaining Souls even after corruption. You don’t know what it did to her beforehand. Could she maybe... have been a success?

    “...”

    What would that mean if it’s true?

    For once in recent history, you kind of hope to dream tonight. You have some serious questions for the silver-eyed shade, should it deign to show up.

    <em>Scene 161</em>
    But it doesn’t. Instead, you sleep well into the next morning, recovering from days of exhaustion. By the time you wake up, it’s already nearly midday. And by the time it actually <em>is</em> midday, news of the decision has anticlimactically reached you; the nurse who brings you lunch mentions that you’re free to go.

    “R-really? But no one told me?”

    “My apologies, but I’m telling you, Miss Angel. Archangel Mirasen asked me to bring the news.”

    “... Mirasen?”

    “Apologies again, Miss Angel. Archangel Aveline Mirasen.”

    “O-oh!” <em>How have I never heard her last name until now?</em> “O-okay; I guess I’ll... just go...? After this?”

    “Very good.”

    And so, after a marginally less awkward walk downstairs, you emerge from a seldom-used door around the back of Illim Hall and out onto the Cathedra grounds again. Just like that; really. You... suppose you should go back to Hearth Hall? What day is it? Is anyone going to be around?

    “Jess!” “That was sudden-” “You’re okay!” “Welcome back.”

    Yes. Yes, they are.

    It’s nice to finally be able to calm down after so long. Pretty much all your friends are around or stop by later - you get an awful lot of condolences, offers to help you get revenge, or just general gratefulness for your survival. Sometimes all three at the same time! At some point, you explain most of what happened, though - having dodged a potentially massive problem by a matter of sentences - you leave out the same bits as you did earlier. You’re in public; it would definitely not be good to immediately say anything conflicting with the official report.

    Later into the evening, the topic of conversation shifts towards fallen Angels. It’s only natural, with all the context. Gossip has - as usual - spread quickly and it’s already common knowledge what the prime council had just discussed. Honestly, if you didn’t know better, you’d think someone on the council was purposely spreading this information. Hmm...

False Angels who just want to destroy everything?” That’s Serri, sitting cross-legged next to Jun. They’ve really become good friends since he Ascended.

    “W-well, Erejil was actually a h-”

    “It’s not quite like that,” Erich interrupts, rudely but conveniently saving you from having to explain half-Angels in front of everyone. That should <em>probably</em> still stay mostly quiet, you belatedly realize. “Fallen Angels are just those who have lost their connection to God. Erejil did fall, but he had a host of other problems beyond that.”

    “Er... yeah.”

    “What does that mean, though? Like, what <em>exactly</em> is your connection to God?”

    <em>Thanks, Serri. I don’t want to be too obvious here if I can help it...</em>

    “Would it annoy you to learn there isn’t a precise definition?” Yara asks from his regular chair. “Because there isn’t, and it does annoy me, to spoil the answer. How Souls connect to God is difficult to study because we can’t <em>see</em> God, unlike Souls themselves.”

    “The Emissary can.” Who is that? See, this is why you didn’t say anything too personal here; you don’t know that Angel.

    “No, I’m afraid he can’t. The Emissary can commune with God through the Lordstone, but he can only see Souls the same way we can.”

    “... Does a Soul look different if it has a connection or not?” Naoriel is sitting right next to you, having almost cried when you showed up earlier. She’s trying to be cool now, but you can tell she has a lot to talk about later.

    “I don’t think so,” Yara responds, though he’s not as confident this time. “Certainly, if it did, I don’t suppose there would be any need for the primes to debate our dear Jessamine’s holiness, mm? The Emissary could simply look and verify on his own.”

    Well, that does make sense. “So how can you tell at all? Just by how you act?”

Perhaps there’s an incubation time, and if Jessamine had fallen, she would have been attempting to demolish the building by this morning!”

    “...D-don’t worry,” you stammer. Everyone’s looking at you; <em>thanks</em> Yara. “Not feeling v-very destructive today!”

    “Fallen Angels don’t lose their Minds,” Erich reasons. “So why wouldn’t one try to hide their true identity until it’s the right time to strike? The corruption increases their power, but not enough to overcome the whole Cathedra in a direct battle. So why not just bide your time instead, hiding and...” He seems to realize what he’s saying at this point, mostly by your expression. “Ah - that is to say, certainly those of us very familiar with Jessamine would be able to tell if she had fallen. The transformation changes you, even if all three aspects stay intact.”

    Nods, but some more nervous this time. <em>THANKS</em>, Erich. “Y-yeah; I’m still the same as b-before! The Emissary and the primes agree too, right?”

    “Yes! Besides, our Jessamine has far too strong a will to succumb to the corruption!”

    A few other people voice agreement with that. You’re partially flattered, but also partially anxious at who doesn’t. Maybe they just don’t want to speak up, but maybe they harbor secret doubts. You certainly do. Besides, it’s not like you’ve forgotten the whole “connection to God” thing. What <em>else</em> would a glowing tube to the ceiling be? Just some <em>other</em> connection to some <em>other</em> sky?

    And yet, you don’t feel like destroying anything, or killing anyone, or even anything as mild as causing a fuss. If you have fallen, it really doesn’t seem to be affecting you at all. At least, not that you can tell. Maybe it’s one of those insidious things that changes you in ways you can’t even see, <em>because</em> you’re changing.

    <em>Scene 162</em>
    “So, what did you want to tell me?” you ask Naoriel, now that you’re back upstairs and without any nearby eavesdroppers. Someone has already brought your stuff back to your room from the apartment.

    “What? Was it... I was going to wait a bit; you just went through so much. You don’t need to worry about my problems again so soon.”

    “But I want to.” A pause; you feel like that deserves a little more explanation. “I... don’t really know what to do about a lot of what happened, and just sitting around overthinking it isn’t going to help. I could... use a distraction?”

    “Really? You’re not just saying that to be nice?”

    “Really. I’m being totally selfish right now, if that makes you feel better.” <em>Well, maybe not TOTALLY, but...</em>

    “... A little.” She takes a deep breath. “Okay. I... think I know who the betrayer is. And how to find out for sure.”

    “You mean out of our last two suspects? Is it one of them? How?”

    “Er... Y-yeah. Maybe. Look, do you remember back when you first figured out I was... you know?”

    “Yes?”

    “I said I never knew my mother. But I was thinking, I know she’s still alive. I know she’s somewhere in the Cathedra. And I know she wants nothing to do with me. We know the betrayer fits those criteria too, and we know she somehow doesn’t want to just tell everyone. Why? Maybe... because that would implicate her as well? Because she’s my mother?”

    “Th-that’s kind of a leap...”

    “So I asked my dad. He’s always told me I’m better off not knowing who my mother is. I kind of assumed it was because I might accidentally react to her if I knew, or just because she hates me and it’d be real awkward. But this time I asked if maybe it’s because she actually wants to kill me.”

    “... What did he say?”

    “Well, you know him. Didn’t say anything useful. But out of our two suspects, doesn’t one of them look a lot more like me than the other?”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1282407597424771172 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1282407597424771172><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, September 8, 2024 2:29 PM">2:29 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“...” You consider Aveline and Kamiya. They do have strikingly different appearances, and Naoriel is right. Aveline looks nothing like her, while Kamiya shares her hair tone and eye shape. It had never really occurred to you before, though now that it has, you’re not really sure why not.

    “Yeah, you’re thinking about it now. He didn’t say if I’m right - obviously - but I have an idea for how to confirm it without his help. And... it involves you having to do more weird magic again. Sorry it keeps turning out like that.”

    “... What do you need me to do? <em>Please</em> don’t say read your dad’s Mind. I really <em>really</em> can’t do that.”

    “No. I want you to read <em>my</em> Mind.”

    “O-okay? I can do that, but how is that going to help if you don’t know either? You can read your own Mind better than I can. You know, by thinking?”

    “Well, that’s what I thought at first, too. But I know I have seen my mother at some point: when I was a baby. Dad told me way before that she didn’t leave until a few days after I was born, so I <em>must</em> have seen enough to recognize her; I just can’t find the memories. And that’s where Mind magic comes in.”

    “So let me get this straight. You want me to dig through your earliest memories to try and find the ones <em>right after you were born</em>, so we can hopefully get a glimpse of your mother’s face?”

    “That’s right. Again, sorry it’s always something weird when I ask for help.”

    “... You trust me enough to do something like that? I - I probably know enough to at least try, but - if you’re letting me be in control... I mean, I could dig up all kinds of embarrassing moments, even by accident! It’s really hard to stay completely focused, especially if what we’re looking for is so far back.”

And if you accidentally find a memory of me being stupid as a baby, well, I was a baby. That’s what they do.” A pause. “And I need to know this.”

    “... Let’s say we do find something. We learn that your mother is Kamiya, and that she’s the betrayer. Hypothetically. Then... what are you going to <em>do</em> with that information?” You hesitate, hoping she has an immediate answer, but nothing comes. “We already don’t have any good ideas for dealing with the betrayer aside from that one possibility of trying to change her memories, and just knowing who she is isn’t going to help with the fundamental problem. If she gets arrested, she’s just going to tell everyone.”

    “If... if I know who she is,” Naoriel begins, looking down at the carpet. “I have the same power over her. She can tell everyone what I am, but I can tell everyone what she’s done. If either of us say anything, both of us lose. Maybe right now she’s got some plan to make it so she can get away with it if she talks, but... at least this way, it won’t work. And maybe... maybe if I know, I can convince dad to be honest with me. To finally explain.” A few seconds of silence. “I just... I need to know, okay? Is that too much to ask?”

    “N-no! No, it isn’t.” The shade’s words wind through your Mind again - unbidden - offering to mend a broken puppet. If the secret is revealed, but Naoriel isn’t a half-Angel... everything will just work out. There would be no evidence that she’s a danger to anyone, but there would still be evidence of the betrayer trying to kill her. If it works like that... if the shade isn’t lying...

    <em>Scene 163</em>
    “Yes. If you think it will help, I’ll do it.”

    A relieved exhale. “Thanks. I know I’m always asking you for help; one of these times I’d like to do something for <em>you</em> for once.”

    For a split second, you consider telling her about the shades. The tube; your concerns about falling. To give her a secret of yours to match the one you hold of hers. But... that’d just be selfish, right? It might make you feel better to tell someone, but it’s not like she could do anything about it. Plus, if you start talking about the silver-eyed shade, you might say something about its offer. And you definitely aren’t ready to decide if you’re going to share that just yet.

    Instead, you just go with something safe. “I appreciate that. Maybe soon. But, er, anyway, I can’t do anything magical for a bit; they say I need to rest for at least a week. And I need to prepare as well, since I haven’t done something like this outside of practice.”

    “That’s fine! Take the time you need! So... in a few weeks, then? And you’ll tell me if I can help you with anything in the meantime?”

    “... Yeah. I’ll let you know.”

    Maybe.

    ...

    You don’t get much time to prepare over the next few weeks, anyway. You have to talk with Brother Cobb about your practical, explain things again, lie to more people. Return to your courses, work with your instructors on what you can do without magic for a week. Visit the hospital every other day to make sure you haven’t died, suppressing your anxiety every time that they’ll notice something about your Soul that they hadn’t previously. It never happens, but that doesn’t stop you worrying.

    You overhear that there’s been a big reorganization in the fourteenth district’s constabulary. People have been fired; others have been promoted to replace them. It’s because of you, but the shakeup doesn’t really make any difference <em>to</em> you, so it’s hard to care. Administrative penalties won’t bring anyone back to life.

Remila, the constable who accompanied you to the mill and was shot from behind, did not survive. That’s not a surprise, really, but you’re at least partially relieved to learn that they recovered her Body. She wasn’t taken and turned into some horrible corrupt monster. It’s small comfort, but it’s something.

    Kate - Mila’s friend - also survived. <em>That</em> actually surprises you. The mill had been empty by the time Yara’s group arrived, and most of the workers had been found later in the cistern or nearby. Yara said they didn’t find any survivors, but apparently a small group managed to escape into the tunnel network similarly to the way you did not long before the Angels arrived. It’s unclear how they avoided the corrupted creatures lurking in the passages long enough to find their way to the surface hours later, but you feel just a little better if you imagine they followed the trail you cleared out during your own escape. So you go ahead and believe that’s what happened.

    Briefly, you consider meeting her in some capacity - or at least passing on a message via Clarity or Yara or someone - but after a few minutes’ consideration, you decide against that idea. You don’t know her and there’s nothing you can say about what happened to Mila that would help. Honestly, you don’t even know how close they were. They could have been just acquaintances; you’re assuming a lot after just a few minutes worth of eavesdropping.

    The cistern itself was purged during the fight, so the oily, shiny liquid at the bottom remains a mystery. Whether it was related to the spawning pools or not is a question you probably won’t be able to answer - unless maybe you can convince a shade to say something. And if you can believe whatever they might say.

After escaping just before the Angels arrived, it truly seems to have vanished. Maybe disappearing into another section of the city, maybe lurking in the tunnels somewhere, maybe even retreating into the wastelands for a while. It’s impossible to know until it shows up again - and you <em>know</em> it will. Your dreams have been uneasy lately - full of empty rooms and tenuous silences - like you’re just <em>waiting</em> for something to happen. The silver-eyed shade will return soon, you just know it. But what it’s going to say, and how you’re going to react... you have no idea.

    You recover your permission to use magic after two weeks, when Aveline pronounces your Soul stable enough. It’s a lot more of a relief than you expected, honestly. Just being able to reach out and see and touch the world - it’s become such a central part of your identity in such a short time. No longer needing regular checkups, you finally start to relax about someone possibly discovering your fallen Soul. If it was going to happen, it would have by now. Or you could still be fine and you’re worrying about nothing as usual.

    Throughout all this, you’re constantly thinking about the shade’s offer to Naoriel, and your own part in everything. You’re important to the shades somehow. They kidnapped you and forced you to murder people. The silver-eyed one almost certainly saved your life. Back and forth and forth and back. Dare you trust them? Even enough to just <em>tell</em> her? You haven’t even continued your conversation with Yara about being able to speak to shades, though you’re not sure what he would be able to do about it either. Everything just keeps pressing closer and closer, like you’re nearing some cosmic breaking point. You feel powerless to change your fate, especially with how many more secrets with terrible consequences you seem to be accruing. No, you still haven’t forgotten about Phil’s fortune, even though you definitely should have by now.

    So. It’s time. You’ve read that the best context to do a memory recovery is one strongly associated with that memory; ideally including as much as you can of the original place, people, scenario, and so on. But you can’t borrow an Archangel or break out of the Cathedra and sneak into Naoriel’s childhood home (seriously, you <em>absolutely</em> cannot do that!) so you ponder the next best thing. What might remind her of her mother...?

    <em>Scene 164</em>
    You come up with a bunch of ideas, but most of them are too complicated or don’t actually seem like they’d help that much, upon further reflection. So in the end, you decide that it’s probably best to not worry too much about any of that stuff. Well, most of it. Instead, you’ll just try to stay comfortable and calm, letting you both go into this with clear Minds.

    Again, sort of.

    “Okay,” you say quietly, tense despite all the effort you went through to try and relax. “Ready?”

    Naoriel eyes the pale blue mixture with a slight grimace. “Is it going to taste horrible?”

    “No; it should be tasteless. Just like water.” Since you had plenty of time to prepare, you made a mixture infused with Mind magic that should help prepare the right frame of Mind, without requiring you to actually expend any additional energy right now. And you’re not lying either; the ingredients were just water, directed magic, and some trace mineral powders that can somehow store power like this for a few days. Easier than you thought, and you’re pretty sure Noll accepted your excuse that you just wanted to practice.

    “Okay. Let’s... let’s do it.” With a quick motion, she downs the contents of the small glass and sets it on her nightstand. Without any better ideas for a location, you’re just in her room, hoping it’d be the most comfortable. “You’re right. Just like water.”

    “Feeling sleepy yet?”

    “Y...yeah.” She’s already looking very droopy; she has to move quickly to lie down. “That’s... really fast.”

    “It better be,” you comment. “I spent an hour afterwards staring at a wall because I used too much energy. Anyway, just try to picture her as you’re falling asleep.”

    “Mmmh...” That’s probably an acknowledgement. Wow, you could be selling these drinks as cures for insomnia. At least, you could if they didn’t have serious side effects that you’re about to take advantage of. Namely, dreams.

Instead, you wait another minute or so just to be sure before carefully standing up, walking around the bed, and awkwardly lying down next to her. After all, you’re about to pass out too and you don’t want to fall over.

    <em>Okay,</em> you repeat after her from just a minute ago. Reach out, rest your hand on hers. Even more awkward, but it certainly focuses your thoughts like it’s meant to. <em>Let’s do this.</em>

    You activate your magic, feeling your consciousness quickly slide away. But, if everything goes well, you’ll land in Naoriel’s dreams that you just induced with the mixture. And with your extra power, you should be able to shape them; guide them towards the memory you want to find. It’s buried here somewhere. All you have to do is find it.

    ...

    You blink awake standing in the corner of a hospital room, swaying on your feet before you manage to straighten up. For a moment you’re excited - this is exactly where you meant to be, right? - but it quickly becomes apparent that you’re totally wrong. To start with, Naoriel wasn’t born in a hospital - her mother as an Angel would be far too obvious. And beyond that, Naoriel in this memory is her current age, not a baby. Plus, you realize with a jolt, that’s <em>you</em> in the hospital bed.

    You cautiously shuffle closer to the Naoriel in the chair; she’s dozing lightly, but blinking half-awake every so often to see if the you in the bed has stirred. She doesn’t seem to notice <em>you</em> you.

You’re pretty sure this was just a few weeks ago, when you were in the hospital after your practical - Yara even mentioned he had switched with Naoriel just a few minutes before you woke up. And... now that you consider it, it kind of makes sense that this would be the memory she thought of first. Both of you here, sleeping or drowsing, a bed, not long ago - it’s a strong connection.

    You look at yourself again, presumably through Naoriel’s eyes. Is this really what you look like when you sleep? All squished into the pillow like that, hair half-covering your face. Even with your Angelic beauty, it seems kind of silly. You look away.

    Okay, this isn’t what you’re here for and you don’t have unlimited time or magic. Time to form a connection here to turn back the clock. Honestly, “you” might be a good connection point to memories about her mother; you’ve been a lot more involved in her heritage than most. So if you just attune to Mind again here, flexing your real Soul even through layers of dream, you can...

    Someone knocks on the door. Naoriel jumps up and quickly pushes back the chair; she literally knocks you over in her haste. Somehow, your Body doesn’t offer any resistance to the push; it’s like you were nothing more than a leaf caught up in her passing. A leaf that can bruise. Ow; you had better be careful in here. Injuries in dreams have never carried over to your Body in reality before - even when you’ve been actually killed - but given the weird ways Mind magic can link things together, it’s probably better not to risk it.

    <em>Scene 165</em>
    You shake your head, quickly dismissing that idea. Although it’s tempting to listen in, you’re not here to snoop on Naoriel’s memories - even if they involve you! She’s trusting you to do the right thing here, and that means not worrying about stuff that isn’t your business! So, instead of trying to overhear their quiet conversation by the door, you immerse yourself in the flow of thoughts that shapes the dream. With a few careful nudges, you can guide the stream. Change the focus. Move back in time... there.

    Using yourself as the pivot point, as it were, you shift the scene back as far as you can. Shapes twist and colors bend; you find yourself back in Hearth Hall, watching a younger pair of you and Naoriel talk about Inquisitors in the cafe. This was <em>ages</em> ago by now - your very first day. Second? Depends on how you count, you suppose. You had been a lot more overwhelmed then, wondering about all the secrecy and hidden motives between the Angels in the common area. Now, of course, you have a good idea of why Zeke had been so interested in her, and why she had been so eager to get away. Her heritage, again. Which would be another good connecting point to use, if you can just manage to leap further back to memories you haven’t seen.

    But as you’re preparing to shift the scene again, Naoriel gets up to leave. That makes sense; she had left the building shortly after this conversation, but now that you’re tied to her perception instead of your own... yep, there it goes. The cafe slowly fades to indistinct grey as the memory-Naoriel exits, losing more detail every second as people melt into featureless mannequins. It’s a little uncomfortable to watch happen, honestly; it’s just a <em>smoothing</em> until there’s nothing distinct about anyone. Without her conscious attention, there’s nothing left here to remember.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1284583233027178546 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1284583233027178546><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, September 14, 2024 2:35 PM">2:35 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Well, it’s a little creepy, but not really dangerous. You keep one eye on the mannequins just in case they decide to stand up and attack (some of the books mention bad things can happen if you stay in faded places like this for too long), but nothing happens as you finish the spell and transition the memory again.

    She’s younger now, sitting in the back room of a church with someone wearing deacon robes. No one is saying anything, but you can almost hear her emotions. Naoriel is glowing brightly, her Soul spilling out exactly as yours had years ago. This must have been just after her Ascension.

    There’s none of the elation that you might expect; only the fear and confusion that went along with it. Neither of her parents are here, both for obvious reasons, so she has no one to share this moment with aside from the near-stranger of this deacon. And it’s not as if becoming an Angel will solve her problems; if anything, it will only make them worse. More obvious. Before today, there had been the faint hope that maybe her Soul wasn’t strong enough to be chosen to Ascend; that maybe she could live a relatively normal life as an ordinary person. But no. She’s going to be special. And that means more scrutiny; more pressure. More chances to be caught.

    Naoriel just stares at her hands, trying to keep her composure. The deacon doesn’t seem to notice, or he just doesn’t care.

    ... This isn’t a pleasant memory. Even though nothing is actually happening, her strong negative emotions drench the whole thing and affect you too. Despair; anxiety; powerlessness. They all drift into you, melding with your actual emotions in subtle ways. You should probably get out of here, fast.

    You step into the corridor to change the scene. This isn’t far enough back.

    The connection strains this time; the flow resists your meddling. But you force it through anyway, hoping that means you’re getting close to something that’s difficult for her to face. Her mother.

Naoriel is very small now, probably only six or so years old, and seems to be preoccupied building a tower out of sticks she’s found. At least, she is until someone opens the house’s back door and steps out.

    “Naoriel, someone’s come to see you,” she calls softly. “Can you come inside?”

    “No!”

    There’s a brief pause, then someone else steps out. “That’s fine, then,” says Mr Kin, now at least a decade younger and out of his Cathedra uniform. “Hey, how have you been?”

    Oh no you really don’t want to watch this; it’s too personal! You try to escape back into the house, but the maid or whoever that was has already closed the door to give them some privacy, and your sort-of-intangible fingers are incapable of turning the handle. Of course, she doesn’t know that there’s already a ghostly, time-traveling intruder in the garden itself! Maybe if you just go over in the corner here and start weaving your spell, you won’t overhear all that much.

    It doesn’t really work. The conversation is painfully awkward, with little Naoriel obviously not caring much for her father, and Mr Kin obviously trying to win her over despite that. She clearly hasn’t seen him much over the past several years.

    But then, she starts complaining about her mother. How all her classmates have one, but she doesn’t. You hesitate, hoping this can be the connection you’re looking for. How is he going to answer? Seriously, what would you tell a little kid about their mother who hates them? You sure don’t know.

    It seems like he doesn’t either, fumbling through an insufficient explanation that just makes little Naoriel even more mad. You’ve lingered here long enough and you’ve got a connection to her mother to work with anyway; it’s time to move on. You shift the scene back in time again, as far as you can possibly go.

    <em>Scene 166</em>
    ... Not here! With a flash of monotone grey, you’re dumped out of the stream of memories into... well, nowhere in particular, it seems. There’s nothing around but smooth grey emptiness in all directions, aside from a rapidly-retreating point of light that was the stream you were just ejected from. This is the end of the line, apparently. Did you accidentally overshoot and leave Naoriel’s memories entirely? If you did, then... where <em>are</em> you?

    The light vanishes entirely. There’s nothing else here.

    “...” Experimentally, you float around a bit. You can’t walk, since there’s no floor to walk on, but you seem to be able to move around just by aiming where you want to go and... going. Or at least, you think you’re moving. It’s not like there’s anything here to be a point of reference. There’s no gravity either, your hair and clothes floating gently in the nothingness around you, so you can’t even determine which way is down. If there is a “down” at all here.

    ... If there is a “here.”

    You try to shape the dream again - to return back to where you were and maybe try again - but there’s nothing to shape. Starting to get concerned, you try a more general spell, trying to move yourself around Naoriel’s Mind without having to rely on her dreams.

    Nothing. You might be moving, but it’s impossible to tell without anything here.

    “...”

    You consider trying to just wake up and start over. It seems you’re lost, and the mixture that you’re still hesitant to call a “potion” won’t last forever. You could wake up and go back to sleep, restarting with less energy and less time. But... that would be a bit of a waste if you can find some other way out of here.

    “Naoriel...?” you call into the emptiness. Your voice vanishes quickly, without an echo. “Can you hear me?”

You float around a bit more, looking for anything at all, with any of your senses. Physical: obviously not. But Mind and Soul turn up empty too. Hey, was the empty grey background always so dark? Wait; now it’s bright? Or dark again?

    It’s hard to tell just from looking at nothing, so you look down at yourself for reference. Darkness and light flicker across your Body, shadows and luminance mixing from nowhere in particular. That’s a little weird, but you honestly might prefer it over the nothingness from before. Maybe if you find the source of this light show, you can find your way back into... something?

    But... as you noted earlier, there’s simply nothing at all around that could possibly be providing the light or casting the shadow. It’s almost like you’re underwater, with those pretty patterns dancing across you. But there’s no water, no container to hold it, and certainly no lights. Where is it coming from?

    “...”

    The light continues to get more intense as time passes, and thus the shadows do too. Little shards of some unclear material begin to sparkle around you, reflecting light from nowhere to nowhere again. But <em>that</em> - that is something. Something you can work with. Something you can just maybe use to pull yourself back into the dream? As long as they don’t do anything dangerous, like-

    The shards are whispering to you. You can’t tell what they’re saying - there are too many voices overlapping - but it doesn’t sound friendly. There are a few words or phrases that stand out, though: “Soul,” “Not here,” “Go away,” and “Her,” to name a few.

    “Not here,” you murmur. “That’s right; I need to not be here.” <em>Maybe that’s enough of a connection, if I pull REALLY hard?</em>

    “Broken,” the shards whisper. “Useless, pointless, dangerous.”

    “... That’s not right,” you tell them quietly, still trying to focus on your spell. “None of that is right.”

They’re whirling around you now, spiraling closer and faster like an encroaching sawblade. “Broken too. Tainted. Infected. Unholy.”

    “N-no...” But you’re not certain enough to argue further. Also, are you really trying to hold a conversation with <em>shards?</em> Shards of what? Nothing?! And you really do need to get out of here before that whirlwind gets much tighter, so pay attention and don’t let them distract you!

    “Corrupt, corrupt, corrupt!”

    All the lights go out at once. The void is plunged into utter blackness; you can no longer see the shards. The whispering grows louder; more angry. The voice is feminine, but it’s not Naoriel’s. Not yours.

    ... You’ve heard it before.

    Using the shards themselves as an anchor towards Naoriel’s consciousness, you pull with all your might and rocket back into the dream. Shards like blades tear at your clothes and Body as you pass through the cloud, but you’re moving so fast it’s over in an instant. You tumble into another memory, slamming painfully into an unyielding wall. You’re fine. Just another batch of bruises. And the shard-inflicted wounds... that’s not <em>that</em> much blood. You’re okay. It’s fine. This won’t affect your real Body anyway; everything will be all better when you wake up.

    Someone’s crying. A baby. You look up.

    The scene is blurry, with only the largest details visible. You’re in a smallish bedroom, having just smashed into the wall near the door. There’s a man you can only assume is Mr Kin standing beside the bed, reaching down towards a woman and crying infant. You don’t recognize Naoriel as a newborn, but you have no doubt that’s who she is in this scene. No, the real question is the mother - her face is blocked by Mr Kin’s arm - if you just stand up and move a little to the side...

    God; is that a knife?!

    Words come to you as if through a long tunnel. Mr Kin is speaking softly, but firmly. “Put it down. We can make it work if you just give us a few minutes.”

    “It’s <em>our</em> sin to bear, Maede. She is <em>our</em> child. I won’t let you hurt her.”

    You hurry closer. Mr Kin is clutching baby Naoriel to his chest, shielding her with his Body. Shielding her from...

    Archangel Kamiya.

    You turn away, not needing to see any more of the confrontation. Naoriel was right. She was right, and it’s even worse than you thought. Her own mother tried to... is <em>STILL</em> trying to kill her! How?! How could she bear to...

    More shouting from behind you. Holiness. Sin. Corruption. She’s shattered by her transgressions against the Cathedra. Willing - no, obsessively <em>determined</em> - to do anything to make it right. No matter the cost.

    Even from here, facing away, you can feel the raw emotions washing over you. The hatred - for herself, and for the little child in Mr Kin’s arms. The furious <em>need</em> to rectify everything. The deathly, Soul-crushing shame of her sin, personified in just one person. A single life in exchange for redemption. It only makes sense, doesn’t it?

    You shudder and try to move further away. Mr Kin has managed to wrestle the knife away and they’re just yelling at each other now, a screaming Naoriel caught between. This is not your moment to witness. Perhaps it’s Naoriel’s, through you, but...

    ⏪ - Leave. Wake up.

    <em>Scene 167</em>
    You wake up. Push yourself into a sitting position; make sure your actual Body is unscathed, as usual. You’re shaken, but it almost feels like it should be worse than it is. Like maybe you should be crying for her. But... you already knew who it might be. You already knew how ruthless Kamiya can act. Having it confirmed and acted out right in front of you was still a bit of a shock, but...

    “I’m sorry,” you whisper. “What are you going to think when I tell you?”

    ...

    Overall, Naoriel takes it well. You think. She listens to your halting description of what you saw, asks a few clarifying questions, and then says she needs some time alone. That’s fine. You extract a promise that she’s not going to do anything stupid, then leave her to her thoughts. No tears; no anger; no plots of revenge. It probably helps that she’s been considering this possibility for a while now, but somehow it still feels like maybe she’s being a little <em>too</em> put-together about this. You don’t snoop into her Mind any further than you already have, though, so she could just be hiding it well. Honestly, you sort of hope so.

    ... What were those shards?

Still, something about the voice they whispered with - Kamiya’s, almost certainly - combined with how it felt when they tore through your projected dream-Body... feels like you should know what happened. And the place you encountered them... it wasn’t <em>in</em> Naoriel’s Mind. At least, not directly. You couldn’t sense any of her thoughts or emotions in there, and you couldn’t even find your way back into her dreams without help from the very shards you’re so concerned about. So, although you’re tempted to write them off as just bad memories or embodiments of fears or insecurities or something... they were definitely something separate from Naoriel herself. Totally unlike your sickness, which is bound into your Soul so tightly it seems impossible to fully remove (although you’re doing a lot better at not letting it affect you these days).

    Separate...

    The uneasy feeling that you’re missing something important gnaws at you for some time afterwards, winding into the late evening and the start of night proper. You poke through a few books you haven’t returned yet, but nothing sparks your memory. You keep coming back to the seeming contradiction of something so obviously bound to her Mind, but somehow separate enough to be almost entirely divorced from any of her actual thoughts. Corruption? A second consciousness? (yeah, right; be serious.) A curse? A barrier?

    Hmmmm...

    You just don’t know, despite a strong feeling that you should. Unable to figure it out before it gets too late, you just go to bed and resolve to think more about it tomorrow with a fresh perspective.

    ...

Wind brushes against you, blowing softly through the unfinished, glassless windows on either side. There is no furniture; the floor and ceiling are only rough construction materials. Panels are missing in uneven patches. You could make a misstep and plummet a dozen stories to the ground so far below, it’s hidden by the mist.

    “Stringless puppet...” something rasps from nearby.

    You quickly whip around, scanning the building’s darkened corners for a moment until you spot silver eyes gleaming in the shadows. “Now?!” you exclaim, totally forgetting to be afraid of the shade. “After this many weeks? What are you doing back <em>now?”</em>

    The shade does not move from its corner, lurking as nothing but eyes. “You were not ready. Now, it can repair the broken puppet.”

    “Nao - now? B-because she learned... because of what happened today?”

    “It is now ready. All is in place. Does the one who cut her strings still wish to arrange a meeting?”

    “Er - h-hang on; one of your...” You hesitate, not sure whether “friends” is the right word. “Another shade just kidnapped me and did all sorts of horrible things; why would I ever want to trust you?”

    “It is not its multitudes. It did not stand idle. The cut-string puppet was not destroyed.”

    You stand there for a few seconds, trying to parse the thing’s unnatural speech. You had already guessed that, actually. “You told the other shade not to kill me, didn’t you?”

    “It holds no wish to destroy you.”

    “...” You know you should probably stay quiet. Not antagonize <em>this</em> shade, which hasn’t been actively hostile at least. Maybe even helpful. But... “Then, do you wish to destroy humanity?”

    “It does not.”

    “Then... what does it wish for? D-do you wish for?”

    “It will allow those with strings to break them. Puppets without masters. Those without strings know they must strive to free those bound by them, though it may choose different methods than most.”

That’s what the other shade said, too.”

    “It chose other methods.”

    The wind whips at you briefly, dragging a current of fog into the building. Visibility gets even worse; you have to strain to make out the thing’s eyes now. “What are you going to ask me to do, if I accept your help?”

    “Break the strings of those you can. It will not hold you to a method. Simply removing more puppets from the master’s control will be payment enough.”

    For an instant, you were going to ask what that meant. How to break the strings; what these methods might entail. But... in a flash... you know. Of course you do. That moment of indecision when you were trying to save Mila; that tug at your lower back. You <em>could</em> have broken her strings. You <em>know</em> how. You just didn’t know what that meant. Now, however...

    You’re shaking. The understanding fades. You can’t. You don’t even know what you can’t do. You are an Angel. You cannot commit a sin like that. A sin like what?

    Or...

    Can you?

    Dare you?

    Would it really be so bad?

    “It will meet with the broken puppet, if the cut-string puppet wills it. Does she?” The shade’s eyes glint and shift in the mist. “Though, if she does not, it believes the broken puppet is running out of borrowed time.”

    [This is a critical point. One character’s fate will be altered.]

    <em>Scene 168</em>
    “...” It’s not easy, to choose between a grievous sin (but possible recovery for Naoriel) and her near-certain doom through inaction. The shade offers no advice as you work through the decision, seemingly content to just sit in the mist and watch.

    At the end of the day, though, the choice is actually very simple from a certain perspective. Do you want to give Naoriel a chance to survive? Or do you not?

    “I’ll do it. Just tell me how.”

    Another gust of wind blasts through the building, this time making you stagger. Mist obscures everything. The shade’s voice echoes from nowhere, eerily flat with the fog’s dampening. “Simply choose a night. It will be there.”

    “... T-then, tomorrow?” You don’t want to have this hanging over you forever; you’ve already procrastinated enough. Just get it over with, now that you’ve decided.

    “It will arrive.”

    And that’s it. The wind slows, churning the mist in place rather than blowing it through the building. The shade’s eyes are gone, and when you carefully make your way over to its corner, you can confirm it has definitely vanished. You’ve been left alone up in this empty tower, presumably until you wake up. Why does it keep dragging you to these weird places; what’s wrong with your bedroom, like the first time? At least then you could just go back to sleep. Well, you didn’t back then, but-

    “...” You sit down somewhere on the uneven floor, staring through a missing panel into the turbulent mass of mist filling the floor below.

    Honestly, you don’t know what you’ve just signed up for, but you know you’ve got to talk to Naoriel again tomorrow before she meets a shade in her dream without warning. (That’s how it’s going to work, right? It wouldn’t try to come here <em>physically</em>, right?) Oh no; what if she still wants more time to think and you can’t get ahold of her? Why didn’t you say like next week or something? Why were you in such a hurry?

Even if you trust it, and even if it answers your questions, its speech tends to be brief and cryptic. Is it going to do something like the other shade did in the cistern? This one said it chose “different methods than most,” so maybe not? But then what? Tear out a tube? But that just “breaks your strings,” you think; what does that have to do with repairing the “puppet” itself?

    ... What if it makes her like Mila?

    You’ve thought about what happened to her quite a lot over the last few months. Corrupted, but with a Soul. Still human, or at least pretending to be. Destroyed in an instant by an Archangel you’ve come to... hate.

    If that happens to Naoriel... even if it’s true; even if she survives with her Soul intact; even if she’s still herself... She won’t be able to stay here. God, no. She would be considered a corrupted Angel; worse than fallen. Dangerous. To be killed on sight. She would have to leave... but go where? Nowhere in the city is safe from the Cathedra, and the wastes are home to the corruption. Perhaps if she’s considered corrupted herself, the shades and beasts wouldn’t try to harm her, but...

    No, living in the wastes isn’t anything more than a temporary solution. She can’t stay out there forever, even if she ends up somehow immune to the poison in the air and somehow able to find enough food and water to stay alive. She would become like the shades; like the Mindless beasts out there. An animal, to be hunted by Angels and eventually slain.

    Could you mask her presence somehow? Shades can hide in the city, so there must be a way for even strong corruption to stay hidden. If she stays away from Angels; perhaps belowground or in less-frequented areas? Maybe the shade has some tips? Spells? They can’t cast magic, but they can manipulate Souls. Maybe she can learn how to hide?

You’d be heartbroken, of course, but you’d know what to do. Destroy the corruption creature. That’s how you’ve been trained. And of course, if she can be fixed without any of this, that’d be much much better! It’s the uncertainty of the middle ground that really has you on edge.

    Well. You’ll just have to tell her everything you know and everything you’ve guessed. Then, she’ll have to make her own decision.

    “...” The fortune cards dance behind your eyes as you blink in the mist. Why? Why have they affected you so much? Why is Phil’s warning so persistent? It was an interaction of only minutes, with some probably-charlatan, and so long ago! Why do you still remember it with such clarity?

    You sleep poorly, waking up grumbling and certainly not refreshed. You still don’t know what the shards are. You still don’t know what tonight’s meeting with the shade will bring. You still absolutely have to find Naoriel and tell her what’s about to happen.

    ⏩ - Tell her immediately; ignore your daily responsibilities if necessary.

    <em>Scene 169</em>
    Thankfully, it’s not too difficult to do that. She still seems put-together enough when you meet up with her around midday, and doesn’t seem surprised when you ask to talk later. Probably thinks it’s about the previous day’s revelations, but that’s okay. You’ll probably need to talk about that, too. No worries; no rush.

    No, what <em>actually</em> catches you off-guard are the rumors you start to hear in the afternoon. As per usual (and per your request), Clarity is among the first to give you a real summary of what’s going on.

    “Jess; <em>there</em> you are! Listen, something big is happening.”

    “Big? How big? What kind of big?”

    “Prime big.” She sits down across from you, slowly pushing your book closed so you have to pay attention. “Ooh, memory manipulation? Sneaky you!”

    You snatch the book off the table, flustered at how quickly she parsed the upside-down and quite lengthy title. “I-it’s for my Mind course. Anyway, sorry, <em>prime</em> big?”

    “Yeah. The council’s getting together again for an emergency meeting, but guess who’s not there?”

    “... Do I have to guess?”

    “I suppose not. It’s Mr Inquisition.”

    Freeze. “You mean, er, Mr Kin?”

    “That’s the one! Head of Inquisition himself, left out of an emergency session of the rest of the powers that be. And it’s not like he’s not here either; they’re purposely excluding him. Seems a little suspicious, don’t you think? To have a meeting without the very guy in charge of policing the council?”

    “Yeah...” A pause; this is <em>supremely</em> bad timing. And you can’t help but fear that it has something to do with what you and Naoriel just learned. “So... are the rest of the primes up to something, you think?”

Well, I suppose. But really, this sort of thing has happened before. It usually leads to the missing prime being ousted for one reason or another. But the prime of Inquisition is usually pretty much immune to any sort of prosecution because he <em>is</em> the prosecution - it must be something really big to try going after him.”

    You try very hard not to let your worries show on your face. “A-any guesses what it could be? Or should we just wait to find out?”

    “Hmmm! Well, for anything reliable, we’ll just have to wait and see. Guesses from anyone not at the meeting are almost bound to be wrong. But! That doesn’t stop me from making them anyway!” She considers this for a few moments. “Let’s see... if they really are trying to get rid of him, it would make sense to be connected to something Inquisition-related that happened recently. Something that’s a very big deal. Hum... what about that betrayer Angel? They were a big deal just a few months ago and no one ever caught them. Maybe something new has happened very recently? Or maybe they’re just sick of the Inquisitors not finding anything?”

    “...” Now <em>that’s</em> a concern. It has been months since anything happened with the betrayer Angel - obviously it would be a concern for the other primes. You know Mr Kin figured it out (or so he claimed to Naoriel), but he’s hiding it. Probably to protect her from retaliation by said betrayer. But... if he’s just sitting on this information about a traitor to the Cathedra...

    “Jess, you wouldn’t happen to have any extra details about this whole thing, would you?”

    “H-huh? No! No, I wouldn’t!”

    Clarity leans in a little closer, pressing against the table. “You sure? That sure looked like an ‘I do, but I don’t want to tell you’ face to me.”

    “...”

    “C’mon, please? I’d owe you one. Or-”

    You shake your head but don’t say anything, not trusting yourself to not give anything else away.

Fine, have it your way. I’m sure we’ll all know before too long; the primes try to be secretive, but information just has a way of slipping out.”

    “...” <em>A secret will be exposed which should have remained hidden.</em> You can almost picture Phil’s hands as you drew the last card, the spy. <em>A betrayal.</em> It has to be this one. It has to be close. But who will it be?

    “Hm! Playing the quiet game, then? Alright, I’ll leave you alone. Hope whatever you know doesn’t worry you too much!”

    “... Me, too,” you whisper.

    ...

    Later, you and Naoriel sit quietly in her room as the sun sets somewhere beyond the mist. It’s dark already and the fog is particularly thick tonight. Humid. It could rain. A bad portent, if you believed in that kind of thing. Which, at this point...

    “So, he knew about this?” you ask.

    “... For a while now. It’s hard to have an investigation like this go on for too long without some kind of result, even if that result is ‘we found nothing.’ But they <em>did</em> find something, and hiding it for so long... Well, he thought something like this might happen.”

    “But it’s so sudden. It’s been months since anything happened; why now?”

    “I don’t know.” She pauses; glances sideways at you. “The timing... do you think maybe we had something to do with it?”

    “I wondered that too. But I don’t know what could have made the difference. It’s not like we told anyone about what we were doing.”

    “Someone could have guessed.”

    “And done what? It has nothing to do with the betrayer situation, mostly!”

    She sighs. “I don’t know. I was almost feeling optimistic yesterday - we were finally figuring things out! - but now... it kind of feels like everything’s falling apart. If they fire my dad - even if they don’t arrest him or anything - the next head of Inquisition won’t be so lenient. They’ll definitely find me. And that’s not even to say anything about the betray-” She stops; forces herself to say it. “- my mother.”

    “...” You’ve had very similar thoughts.

    “...” You have to say it. Even if you don’t trust the shade, you’ve already agreed. And now, it really does seem like it might be the only possible option. You take a deep breath... chicken out, exhale, inhale, and try again. “I might know how to repair your Soul.”

    A long pause. Naoriel stares at you. “That’s not very funny, Jess.”

    “N-no; I mean it! I really-” You hesitate, stumble over your words a little. You shouldn’t reveal that you can speak to shades, but... come on. To her? “I’ve... had a visitor in my dreams for a while now...”

    As you explain, you try to gauge her reaction by her expression. You’re speaking nonsense. Absolute heretical sin. But it’s also a lifeline. Possibly the only option left for her. Driven into a corner by the circumstances of birth, an Angel <em>can</em> dare to consider it. To have some form of faith - of hope - into the corruption that all of you must fight.

    A twinge in your lower back. Forbidden knowledge. You can’t.

    It takes longer to leave your Mind this time. Longer for your Body to quiet down. Longer for your Soul to reject the sin. You’re terrified of the moment when it won’t leave at all.

    “I’ll... listen to what it has to say,” she says eventually. Of course she does; it would be near-impossible to refuse.

    The cards. The sin. The betrayal.

    All that’s left now is to go to sleep.

    <em>Scene 170</em>
    ...

    You gasp and stumble back in surprise as you wake up to a blinding glare. Shielding your eyes and blinking away the afterimage, you quickly deduce that you’re standing on a large wooden platform raised slightly above a wider area filled with seats. A theater, and you’re on the stage. The blinding light is coming from a raised gallery near the ceiling, casting a brilliant spotlight around you. The rest of the room is totally dark by comparison.

    “Jessamine!” Naoriel calls from somewhere in the darkness, but you’re still addled by the light and can’t see her.

    “Naoriel? It’s... too bright. I can’t; er, where are you?”

    “There are some stairs to your left. The light stops following once you get off the stage.”

    You look around and quickly find the depression she’s referring to. The spotlight tracks your movements as you walk across the stage, but true to her words, it goes no further than the edge. A quick descent into the seats finally frees you from the light, allowing you to locate Naoriel further into the room. It also lets you turn back to the stage, noting a handful of motionless mannequins posed as if interacting with each other. The spotlight drifts idly between them.

    “I’m so glad you’re here,” she says as you approach. “I thought it would just be me and the creepy mannequins.”

    “Glad to see you too; er-” Another glance back to the stage. “They don’t... move, do they?”

    “I don’t think so.”

    “And the spotlight? Who’s controlling that?”

    “I don’t know. It’s too bright to tell and I haven’t found any way to get up there.”

Something glittery. Nestled between a few empty galleries and draping down like spider silk, you can just make out a collection of near-translucent strings... or tubes. They disappear in the spotlight’s glare, but by tracing the arc, you’re pretty sure they connect the mannequins on stage to something in the spotlight’s gallery. “H-hey, do those, er, puppets have - er, can you see those too?”

    “Hm?” You point it out. “Oh! Oh, strings, or something. Is that where the puppeteer usually is, though?”

    “Um...” You have no idea; you’ve never been to a show like this. Do they even perform shows like this? With full-size mannequins on a full-size stage? “Maybe?”

    “Honestly, that just makes them more creepy. Like whoever’s behind the spotlight <em>could</em> make them move, but just isn’t.”

    “Yeah...” Something uncomfortable has occurred to you. Tracing a faint, almost-invisible line up the theater’s rear wall, you can just make out a tube descending from the spotlight gallery to just behind Naoriel. You’d bet quite a lot it would sink into her lower back at exactly the same point you’re now very familiar with. And, as you scan for one connected to you, there’s nothing there. Of course. You cut your strings. You wouldn’t have one.

    The presence of the tubes here makes you very nervous about what the shade is intending to do.

    “Naoriel,” you murmur in a way that’s intended to be comforting but you can tell immediately makes her more wary. “Can you reach behind you? Say, like this?”

    “...” She doesn’t question why, but just does as you ask. Her eyes widen and she quickly looks behind and up. “T-this is the tube you talked about. The one that you, er...”

    “Yeah. And, look.” You wave a hand behind yourself, where your tube would be if you had one. “It’s not there for me.”

    “Why is it here? I’ve never dreamed about this normally; is it the shade?”

Maybe... it’s - it’s probably going to ask you to take it out. I’m guessing! But - I don’t know why else it would be visible. And the puppets over there have them too, and it’s just all...” You sort of trail off, not sure what point to make.

    Naoriel regards the tube, tugging on it slightly and flinching at the brief jolt of pain. Almost exactly as you did, months ago. “S-Should I?”

    You want to answer her question. Give her some sort of advice. <em>Help</em> her. But you thought about this already, and you’ve decided that you can’t. “I’m not going to tell you what to do,” you say firmly. “I don’t think it would be fair for me to decide something this big for you - especially since I don’t even know what the tube does! And I definitely don’t know what the shade is going to do to ‘repair’ you, if you accept. I’m just... I just wanted to give you the chance to decide for yourself.”

    She looks at you strangely. Uncomfortable, you can’t keep her gaze and glance down. “I understand,” she says. “But you can at least - if you were me, what would you do?”

    “I - no; I can’t. I just really, really don’t want to pressure you into anything.” You do feel strongly about that; it’s true. But whether that strong feeling is for Naoriel’s sake, or just to manage your guilt if something terrible happens... that’s something you can’t answer. Even to yourself.

    “... Fine.”

    A minute passes, more or less. Naoriel watches the tube. You watch the mannequins. You’re still not convinced they won’t come alive, but they remain reassuringly motionless. For now.

    “Ah, the broken puppet,” a voice rasps. You jump; Naoriel turns to look. The shade has arrived, standing calmly in the aisle between you and the stage. It casts a diffuse shadow over you from the reflected spotlight. “It is here to deal. You are ready?”

    With some difficulty, you step aside. This isn’t your choice to make. It’s hers.

In detail.”

    “It provides. But it must look first. Know what the break is. Come closer.”

    “...” She takes another step. The shade, potentially impatient, matches it to stand within arm’s reach. You’re honestly more anxious now than any of the previous times you talked with it. Less terrified, sure, but more worried.

    The shade does not touch her, but only looks. Attuned to Soul, you can guess what it’s searching for. The strange fissures and mismatches that aren’t exactly visible to you as you are, but would be with a-

    “Cut-string puppet. It requires clearer vision. Assist.” The shade beckons you over.

    <em>Scene 171</em>
    You hesitate, but slowly make your way over. “You... had better not try to do anything but look, okay? It’s just, the last time a shade did this-”

    “It chooses other methods. It only looks.”

    Wary and not entirely reassured, you stand just to the side, forming a triangle between the three of you. “N-now what?” There aren’t any wires around to grab, and touching the shade directly would burn you both.

    “Hold.” Ah, there are wires. Where did those come from? Did it have them the whole time?

    Still nervous, but drawing on your prior experience to know that you can still resist - to some degree - you grab hold. The same eerie chill as a portion of your Soul is drawn through the wire. But this time, instead of a scalpel or other tool, the other end is just a circle of clear glass that the shade holds to one glowing silver eye like a monocle.

    You don’t feel as empty this time as your Soul circulates through the wire and the shade inspects Naoriel. Maybe the demand placed on you is smaller when you only need to look and not cut, or maybe this shade has better control, or maybe you’re just more accustomed to it. Whatever the case, you still feel fairly lucid and reasonably sure you could drop the rods at any point, if you wanted. So you focus a little less on the shade and a little more on your friend. After all, this arrangement allows you to see more clearly too, and you want to see if you can make out whatever it’s looking for.

    “...” No one speaks. You can see her Soul in more detail than ever before, but just like last time, you don’t know enough to convert the shapes to actual traits. The shade could say whatever it wants and you wouldn’t be able to tell if it’s lying. What if it wants to cut off that little corner there? Would that help? You wouldn’t know.

Even with your lack of experience, you can tell that this Soul isn’t healthy. You aren’t sure what specifically seems wrong, but something definitely does. Is it the dappled, almost broken section there? The swirled ridges here? The... hm? What is that? That sort of change in intensity or hue right near the center? Is it maybe just a little darker than the rest? Or-

    The shade slides the monocle down and retrieves the wires with a tug. You let go, shivering as warmth returns to your Body. “The puppet is twisted upon itself,” the shade declares. “Broken now, but repairable. It can proceed.”

    “Proceed with what?” Naoriel asks, moving back slightly. “I’m not agreeing to anything unless you tell me what you plan to do.”

    “Caution,” the shade notes. “Good. It will do nothing now. Instead, the broken puppet must cut her strings.”

    You were ready for this, and Naoriel was too. “Why? What does that even mean?” she asks.

    “Interference,” it states plainly. “He is protective of His puppets, even those which bear deep flaws. It cannot make repairs with strings still tied. Only destruction is possible.”

    “Jess?” she asks, half-turning to you.

    “I don’t know!” You really, really wish you did. “I - maybe? I couldn’t even understand it until I - h-hang on, why can <em>you</em> understand it already?”

    Naoriel obviously doesn’t know either, but the shade does. “Broken puppets have tangled strings. Flawed; damaged. The restrictions are permeable. But not enough to reshape a puppet entirely.”

    “...”

    “Fine,” she says. “If Jess did it, I’ll... I can do it too. But <em>if</em> I do, what comes after that?”

    “It will operate,” it says simply. “Meet with the broken puppet in reality, in the city, and repair her. The cut-string puppet will assist again. There must be balance between the kinds to perform the operation. Too much of yours and the puppet will be destroyed. Too much of its and the puppet will change. With balance, repair is possible.”

You will act as a power source again, like you did with the other shade. If she agrees, you’ll have no other choice than to just trust it. But... the words about balance are somewhat surprising; it needs “your kind” to help her? Is that where the Cathedra has been going wrong all this time? Not using “its kind” - the corruption, presumably - to try to heal half-Angels?

    “What will she become at the end of it?” you interrupt, unable to stop yourself. You have to know - or at least you have to know what it <em>claims.</em>

    They both look at you. The shade answers. “The puppet will become herself. Whatever that is.”

    “What does that mean?” You’ve shut your mouth again; that’s Naoriel.

    “It will not change the puppet to one who never had strings. The puppet will not change beyond recognition.”

    “Will she be like Mila?” You just can’t help yourself, can you? Well, you didn’t tell Naoriel much about Mila so maybe this question is necessary. Besides... that scenario kind of matches up to what it said now. A shade; an operation. An Angel; your light keeping her together. Balance, perhaps. Until a change. Recognizable, but...

    “Repairs are inexact. It cannot discount the possibility, though it believes the broken puppet is strong enough to avoid even that change.” A pause; you don’t say anything. “Adding more of your kind may help avert such an outcome, but adding too much will destroy the balance. It will calculate with the cut-string puppet ahead of the procedure.”

    “... Okay,” you say. Quietly. You’re not entirely convinced, and it could be lying through whatever shades have instead of teeth, but... there’s just no way to know. And if the other option is to just let Naoriel die...

    “I’ll do it.”

    “Naoriel?! You - already? You don’t even want to think about it first?”

There will be plenty of time to change my Mind before the actual operation, right?”

    The shade nods. “It cannot be sooner than three months from cutting your strings. The puppet’s Soul must stabilize after the change, before further changes can be made.”

    She turns back to you. “There; see? Three months from now is mid-November, and we’ll need a few days off to go into the city and do whatever we need to do, so it’ll actually be even longer. Let’s do it.”

    “...” You actually hadn’t expected her to agree so readily, and you’re starting to wonder if maybe you managed to influence her decision anyway. Even after trying so hard to avoid that!

    “The festival days at the end of the year. Can that work?”

    “Yes.” The shade’s expression remains inscrutable, but you have to wonder if it’s as surprised as you.

    “There. That’s when it’ll be, then. Five months to change my Mind. Now-”

    She reaches around behind herself. Grasps the tube. Finally slows down for a moment.

    You and the shade say nothing.

    “...” She tugs it again, just a little, and gasps in immediate pain. “J-just a minute...”

    Forbidden knowledge. Your eyes widen. You could cut her strings. Your arms tremble; your hands clench. The sin blossoms in your Mind; your Soul is slow to flush it out. You could do it. You could you could you could you-

    <em>Scene 172</em>
    You can’t! Or rather, you won’t. You struggle silently against yourself for several moments before, finally, the knowledge leaves your Mind and you forget what it was you could have done. This isn’t for you to do. You can’t drop that deeply into sin. Something... you’re not sure how terrible it will be, but <em>something</em> will happen if you do. You will change.

    Although, given how much more frequent these moments of knowledge have become lately, you’re not sure you’ll have a choice for much longer.

    “Jess... could you and, er, ‘it’ l-look away for a minute?”

    “... Yeah.”

    The shade doesn’t say anything, but just follows your lead as you round one of the large pillars holding up a second-floor gallery. Even if you were looking that way, you wouldn’t be able to see anything.

    “T-take your time,” you say nervously, not really sure how to reassure her when you have no real idea what this procedure even does.

    “... Okay...”

    Near-silence for a while. There’s a distracting background hum coming from the spotlight far above, still drifting lazily between the mannequins on the stage. You glance up at it again, still unable to make out any details of who or what might be operating it. Still, the brilliant glare and the obvious metaphor make you fairly certain what it represents. The force that shades call the puppetmaster. God.

    You wonder what He thinks of all this.

    Well, as much as He can, anyway, with His Mind still embedded in the planet. Sacrificed to prevent the darkness from gaining a Mind. And yet, standing just beside you is a creature of darkness with a Mind. God’s sacrifice only slowed it down.

    So... why hasn’t anything changed? Why hasn’t He returned His Mind to the sky and done something different? Is He still preventing the majority of darkness from gaining Minds and something terrible would happen if He returned above? Does He simply have faith in you, collectively, to still win?

    Or...

    Can He not?

In the past, you decided that maybe only humans are so fragile to need the three aspects together to maintain themselves, and God can split Himself however He wishes with no ill effect.

    But maybe, just maybe, humanity is more of a mirror of God than you’d like to believe. After all, would it really be a “sacrifice” if He could put Himself back together at any time? Cathedra doctrine states that the sacrifice was just of the moment, and that He could always return above to remake the world if He wished. That He simply loves humanity too much to do that without giving you a chance.

    But if you did that - if <em>you</em> split up your aspects and embedded your Mind in the planet - you would die. And as you are a reflection of God...

    A horrible, ghastly sound paired with a hitched gasp. Fluid splatters on the floor. One of the tubes above - disappearing into the spotlight’s gallery - twitches. A thump.

    “Naoriel!” You rush around the pillar; the shade follows more sedately. She’s lying on the ground, blood and clear fluid pooling around her just like when you had done the same thing. But unlike before, there’s a ragged, gaping wound in her back where the thing had connected. Deep, rich blood spills from her Body. “Wh - wait - it didn’t... last time-”

    The shade walks measuredly past you and kneels beside Naoriel. Places its hands on the wound. An indescribable sound, and a patch of fresh skin rapidly grows to cover it. The same symbol: the baseless triangle enclosing a circle.

    “... <em>You</em> did that? Wh-when I... that was you too?”

    “It can seal the break that missing strings leave.” It stands up again, pats her gently on the head. “The broken puppet has courage. It will return to repair her. But now...”

The thunk of a blade embedding itself in wood. Naoriel’s tube falls to the ground beside you, cut cleanly through and still vomiting clear liquid. The shade doesn’t say anything else, and you somehow know it has left the dream.

    She’s stirring, a little. You know the pain must be overwhelming. “Don’t try to move yet,” you murmur. “It’s okay. You’ll feel better soon.”

    And so, wishing you could do more to help, you kneel like that in the blood and fluid until the dream breaks apart and you wake up. It’s a little earlier in the morning than you would normally get up, but you do anyway because you obviously need to go check on Naoriel. Surely she won’t be injured in reality; after all, you never were.

    You get dressed and hurry upstairs, knocking nervously on Naoriel’s door. A few seconds of silence give you pause; you did bring the spare key she gave you just in case, but actually using it would be-

    “Just a minute!”

    You exhale, relieved. She’s not dead or in terrible pain. And when she opens the door and invites you in, you get quick confirmation that her physical Body is as unaffected as yours was. In fact, she’s feeling better than normal. Energized. In control.

    You doubt that feeling will last very long, with the primes’ meetings still ongoing. Unfortunately, there isn’t much you can do about that and there isn’t <em>anything</em> you can do about her Soul for several more months. You’ll just have to see what happens and hope your operation won’t be too late.

    And speaking of (thinking of) poor timing, it’s Endle Day tomorrow. You’ve gone home for it every year so far and every year has been another disaster of some flavor or another. Are you going to try again this year?

    <em>Scene 173</em>
    Well, third time’s the charm, or so they say.

    Nothing else of particular note happens for the rest of the day. The primes continue their discussion. You don’t find anything more on the shards. You prepare for tomorrow. That sort of thing.

    And then, the next morning, you pass through the Cathedra’s gates and make your way back to Nucarreo’s central station for the third year in a row. This time, your disguise isn’t bad at all (compared to “mediocre at best” last time and “not even your spell” the time before that) so the guards don’t give you any trouble. They don’t even seem particularly concerned that you’ll get kidnapped or find a corruption creature to fight, despite your alarming precedent for getting into trouble. Honestly, you kind of expected someone to object to you leaving on your own again.

    But you suppose no mere human would tell you what to do.

    The train is crowded, as usual, and you don’t even get a window seat this time. Instead, you’re stuck between two boisterous families who are far too excited about getting to their respective relatives’ homes. You just try to block out the noise as best you can as the train rattles along, high above the city you can’t even see because of the aforementioned seating situation. Oh well. The contrast is kind of funny, at least. If these people knew who you really were, they’d quiet down for sure.

    Arrive, disembark, and start walking. The sixth district seems much the same as the last time you were here, though you’re careful to keep an eye out for anyone walking strangely or with an unusual affinity for gloves. Nothing yet, but you can’t be too careful.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1290472884531363842 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1290472884531363842><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, September 30, 2024 8:38 PM">8:38 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Still... the atmosphere here seems a little off. Subdued, maybe? Just like last time, there aren’t many people around. Perhaps they’ve all gone to various festivals and left the gloomy ones behind, but you’re not fully convinced of that, no matter how much you might want to believe. It’s kind of your duty as an Angel to investigate weird things like this too... though you probably shouldn’t get too carried away given what happened the last few times.

    “...”

    You should at least make it to your house before you start doing anything crazy.

    So you do that. Cautiously observe the few passers-by you see, but all of them seem normal (if a little glum). And eventually make it to the familiar door of your parents’ house. This time, you don’t have any trouble knocking, greeting your brother when he comes to answer the door, or-

    “What the heck?!” you exclaim, before you can even get inside. “You got tall!”

    Chuckles from inside. Seth grins at you. “Still think you can jump over me?”

    “... You’ve been thinking about that for a whole year, haven’t you?”

    Indeed, Seth is several inches taller than he was last year, now able to fit his whole hand between the top of his head and yours. Vertically! That’s like, half a foot or something! You knew he was taller than you last year, but you didn’t stop to measure and it hadn’t been this extreme. But now, it’s <em>really</em> obvious.

    This topic kind of dominates the conversation for the first few minutes as you demand to be measured and dad laughs all the way to the tape measure and back. “It’s just because I’m aging more slowly!” you declare after it’s confirmed that Seth is a full <em>seven inches</em> taller than you at this point. “I’ll grow more in a few years; you just wait!”

You get really close, but, to your embarrassment and Seth’s amusement, can’t conclusively make it. It’s within an inch or so, but you simply don’t have the strength.

    At least, not until you impulsively drop your disguise (in broad daylight; Jess what the <em>hell</em> are you doing?!) and switch to enhancing your muscles with magic, now able to comfortably sail over his head. Then one thing leads to another and you’re having another sparring match while your dad nervously guards the entrance to the little park because you’re still being too reckless to put your disguise back on. Honestly; what’s with you today?

    With Body-enhancing magic, you win handily, but when dad finally manages to convince you to calm down a little and refocus on your disguise, Seth ends up winning. No swords-crossed tie this time; he actually squeaks out a 3-2 victory. And at that point, the sensation of how ridiculous all this is catches up with you both and you end up laughing on the ground as you recover from the back-to-back duels.

    “I know I said this last time too,” he says eventually, helping you up. “But I never thought I’d see the day when I could have two full sparring matches with you, and you’re still perfectly healthy afterwards. I’m really glad God chose you.”

    “You know what?” you begin, checking to see if dad brought any water. He did; what a champion. “Me too. Even with everything going on, I’m happy to be an Angel.”

    “No quiet disclaimers? You really have grown up! Although you’ve still got some growing <em>up</em> to do.”

    “Come on!” you groan. “I’ll get taller! Or do you want me to do it with magic; I bet I can-”

    “No more magic!” dad interjects, shaking his head comically. You laugh again; it’s just that kind of moment.

If you’re aiming to be a soldier, you really do need to be better than me. What are you doing in your training by now? You’re in your third year too, so halfway there?”

    And so, basically by accident, you spend most of the day just catching up with your family. Not unexpected, really, but you had kind of anticipated having some time to investigate the weird gloom over the district. Although you certainly aren’t feeling it now. Maybe it was all in your head again? Mind magic doesn’t register anything to purge this time around when you try, so... maybe you’re just legitimately losing it and there’s nothing wrong this time? That might be nice for a change.

    So. What do you do with the remainder of the day?

    <em>Scene 174</em>
    The answer, as it turns out, is “not much.” You consider going out somewhere - whether to catch up with people outside of your family or hunt for corruption creatures is irrelevant - but it’s kinda late and you’d need to put your disguise back on and it’d just be a <em>hassle</em> so...

    Instead, you just stay in and relax. Listen to how the neighborhood has slowly changed in the last year, and how it’s stayed the same. Describe some of the silly things you can do with magic now, and demonstrate a few of them. Help mom with dinner, because it’s been a while and you just feel like it. You’re not very good at cooking, since your room doesn’t have a kitchen and most of your food is prepared for you, but you do know how to make a few simple things. You do your best.

    While you’re distracted, though, mom asks you a somewhat concerning question. “Jessamine, are you safe?”

    “... What kind of a question is that?” you ask, preparing to tell just a tiny little lie. “Of course I am. I don’t go out to the wastes for another few years.”

    “I know that, but you don’t have to leave the city to be in danger.” She stays quiet for a few moments. “We... heard about what happened in the fourteenth district.”

    “... Oh.”

    “It was all over the news, sweetie. The warehouse, that poor constable, and... they just couldn’t keep a missing Angel a secret.”

    “You didn’t write about this in any of your letters! I - I could have explained a bit if I’d known you heard about it.” You knew everyone at the Cathedra heard, but somehow it didn’t occur to you that normal people would have known too.

    “We didn’t want to worry you any more. I wasn’t even certain I was going to bring it up today. But I just have to know: was it as bad as the news described?”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1291213113064030208 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1291213113064030208><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 2, 2024 9:39 PM">9:39 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“...” Honestly, it was probably worse. But you can’t <em>say</em> that. “I, uh, don’t know what they said, so I don’t know if it was as bad. But, um, it’s not <em>that</em> bad. It really only happened because we didn’t think anyone at the mill was actively working for the corruption. If we had been more careful, or brought more constables, or even just-” You can’t think of a third thing and change track mid-sentence. “- if the chief had kept more of an eye on things, it would have been fine. That’s why they replaced him, I think.”

    “Oh Jessamine, that’s not the problem. It’s just knowing there’s such danger in the city itself, and you’re all caught up in it.”

    “I - I won’t be doing another practical until-” You forget; is there one in your fifth year? There is in your sixth, but-

    “Even if it’s another few years, you’ll graduate. I’m sorry, sweetie. I knew this would happen when He chose you. I just didn’t want to believe how much you would actually be doing.”

    “Mom-”

    “Please don’t let my worries upset you, though. Worrying about their kids is just what parents do. And you’re both going to be in such important roles... but such dangerous ones, too...”

    “...” You don’t know what to say. You’ve thought about this more than once, and you <em>are</em> in a lot of danger quite regularly. Even in the Cathedra itself, with the shade and Naoriel’s mother and all that...

    “I’ll keep her safe,” Seth declares from across the room. “You just have to be okay until I graduate too, and then I can make sure of it. Okay, Jess?”

    You have your doubts that any human could protect you from dream-shades or betrayer Angels or the depths of the corruption you must face. But if there’s anyone you can be sure will give it his absolute best try, it’s your brother. Besides, it’s not like you can say no; what a downer that would be! So... “Okay. We’ll make it.”

You didn’t feel particularly unsafe anyway, but at least his presence stops you from doing anything dumb like going out to look for the source of that gloomy feeling. Instead, you safely make it back to your train and equally safely back to the Cathedra’s gates. An uneventful Endle Day, at long last. You deserved that break. Because you have a sneaking suspicion that events will only continue to escalate from here.

    ...

    Lewis Kin is fired the next week.

    He isn’t <em>arrested</em>, or <em>executed</em>, or even put on trial in a public fashion like Naoriel was worried he would. Instead, he’s simply quietly dismissed and pushed out into the city. Just like Sister Bagley, Yara’s instructor who approved his experiment. It could have been much worse, but you still feel a creeping sense of dread now that he’s gone.

    Obviously, Naoriel isn’t happy about this either, for several reasons. Plus, she can’t even leave the Cathedra to visit him, so she no longer has any way to talk to her dad. Outgoing mail would need an address she doesn’t know, and even if she did, any sensitive subjects would need to be kept carefully hidden. You consider recruiting one of your full Angel friends to deliver at least <em>a</em> message, but that would involve bringing them into the whole half-Angel thing and you really want to keep that as quiet as you possibly can. Especially since you don’t know who the next prime will be.

    With the head Inquisitor’s spot now vacant, top bishops waste no time clamoring for the nomination. The prime council apparently didn’t have a successor picked out, so the post is temporarily filled by one of the other primes while hurried campaigns are run, hushed deals are struck, and the machinations of politics... well, machinate. Every day, you wake up worried that Naoriel will have been arrested overnight. And of course, if she has, you’ll probably be next.

    <em>Scene 175</em>
    Weeks pass. The leaves begin to change as September arrives, grows old, and gives way to October. The new head of Inquisition is selected: some bishop you hadn’t heard of until recently. Arnold Athwood, apparently. A relatively young man, as far as primes go, and one who made his case for the position by aggressively pushing for more transparency and accountability in the Inquisition. That might be good for you (and everyone), but he also claims he will find and capture the betrayer by the end of the year.

    That <em>also</em> might be good for you, if it weren’t for the fact that the betrayer will surely take both of you down with her, if he succeeds.

    In any case, Inquisitors are mobilized in record numbers, and - unusually - publicly so. As someone who’s been involved with at least one of the incidents, you’re questioned again by Sims, who has apparently joined their ranks. Perhaps because he was recently a trainee, they think you’ll be more willing to trust him? If so, that doesn’t work at all; you lie about everything you want to hide, squashing your anxiety with Mind magic and desperately hoping he’ll believe you.

    Somehow, it seems to work. Sims, it seems, is not very good at detecting lies. You try to push aside the thought of what would have happened if a more experienced Angel had been sent to question you instead and do your best to help Naoriel through the same experience. One of your luckiest breaks so far. But you feel that as the self-imposed deadline looms closer, they might send someone else to try again...

Sister Noll is having you learn about Mental curses (at your request), which involves some pretty harrowing contests against other Angels as you try to place, block, or remove long-lasting effects. You’re getting fairly good at defense, but the process of untangling the magic to remove it is a lot harder. And that’s to say nothing of placing curses yourself - you just feel too bad for your target to get it right. At least Noll doesn’t push you much on that front; Mind magic doesn’t work on Mindless darkness anyway, so there isn’t much reason for you to learn how to harm other Minds unless you’re aiming for shades. Which you aren’t. Probably. It’s a real struggle to stay quiet about all that.

    Anyway, you spend a lot of time reading about curses throughout late September and early October, and eventually one book in particular catches your attention in a different way. There’s a brief anecdote midway through a chapter about detection spells, detailing a spiral of “thought shards” that attach to a target’s Mind and just stay there, possibly for years, until they detect an intruder in any specific memories. Then, the shards break apart and alert the caster. That’s it.

    ... Sure seems familiar.

    You reread the passage a few more times and take several minutes to think back on your memories of the shards in Naoriel’s Mind. It could fit. A failsafe; a way to know if anyone tried to access any dangerous memories. You know Archangel Kamiya has the skills to cast a curse like this. You know she has the motive.

    But what you don’t know is, if all this is true and she knows you were snooping around in Naoriel’s Mind, why hasn’t she done anything yet?

    ... Maybe she has.

Maybe she influenced them or asked telling little questions about why the betrayer was still at large. Maybe she has more connections in the council than you thought; after all, this started the <em>day after</em> your spell.

    But why? Assuming you’re right (a big assumption, probably), would a new prime even be a good idea? Sure, Mr Kin was shielding Naoriel, but he also wasn’t going after Kamiya. A new prime wouldn’t have those restrictions; Mr Athwood even called out the betrayer specifically in his immediate goals! Would the extra danger really be worth it?

    “...”

    You hate this; there’s nothing you can <em>do</em> about anything! You can’t tell the Inquisitors about Kamiya. You can’t do... whatever with the shade for another two months at least. You can’t keep Naoriel or yourself safe except by just staying quiet, keeping your head down, and trying to be as invisible as possible until it’s time.

    Somehow, you’ve latched onto the shade’s procedure as a magic cure for all your problems, even though you rationally know there must be a catch. But... if it works and Naoriel is somehow cured without any major problems, it really <em>will</em> all be over. You can just tell the Inquisitors. Kamiya will be arrested, she’ll accuse Naoriel, and there won’t be any evidence because she simply is no longer a half-Angel. It’s perfect. Things certainly won’t go that smoothly in reality, but you find yourself fantasizing about that perfect sequence of events more than once just to calm down.

    “Jessamine?”

    “WA-huh?” You nearly jump out of your chair as someone says your name close behind you, but it’s just Erich. You breathe out tiredly and try to calm down. “You, um, startled me.”

    “Apologies. I just thought you might want to know the library is closing soon and they’re asking everyone to leave.”

    “Huh? What time - it’s already that late?”

    “Your diagrams.” He nods to some of your notes. “Those are Mental curses, if I’m not mistaken. You’ve drawn the mechanics quite well.”

    “Oh, er, thanks.” You start to gather your things; Erich helps out after a few moments. “Just studying for my course. Sister Noll expects a lot.”

    “She is known to be strict.” A slight pause as he tidies up a pile of loose paper. “Jessamine, you are quite adept at Mind magic. And, apparently, you’re studying spells of long duration. Would you... be willing to assist me in... such matters?”

    You look up at him quizzically. “For a project, like we did with Yara?”

    <em>Scene 176</em>
    ... You <em>want</em> to trust him, but you’re very much on edge with the Inquisitors poking around. What if this is just a ploy? “You? Really?” you end up asking. “With what specifically?”

    “Ah, don’t say it like that,” he grumbles. “You must know how difficult I find requesting assistance. I’m working on learning Blessings for my Soul course, and there is a related bolstering technique for Mind that seems to improve the Blessing if you can make use of the same principles. Hence my foray into Mental studies.”

    You’re pretty much packed up by now, so you stuff everything into a bag and start to leave with him. “I think I’ve heard of that; Sister Noll was talking about how I could apply some of the long-lasting techniques from curses into Blessings, when I get around to learning them.”

    “That’s right. It’s a similar sort of concept, just with different aspects and applications. So... would you Mind?”

    “... Y-yeah. Er, no, that’s fine. I can help.”

    “I appreciate it.” He glances at you curiously. “You seem very nervous tonight. Is it anything I could assist with in return?”

    “N-no; there’s just... a lot going on lately.” Not technically a lie, but boy is that generalization doing a lot of work.

    “Hmm. Are you referring to our new prime of Inquisition and the unending questioning we’ve been subjected to?”

    Ah! This could be perfect, actually; maybe you can get Erich to tell you what he thinks of the Inquisitors. Maybe you can even believe him! “Yeah! Sims was the one who questioned me, actually, which was kinda awkward because - well, you know how he is.”

    “I do.” A pause; he seems to remember something. “Unfortunately, I imagine you’ll likely get another interrogation in the next few days.”

    “What? Why?”

Honestly, I’m not particularly impressed with the new Inquisition so far. Already a blunder that will require redoing a lot of work, and because it’s more public now, it’s easy to look at them and think ‘they aren’t perfect.’ Their reputation was part of their effectiveness. Jessamine? Am I making sense?”

    “Er, y-yeah; effectiveness.” Admittedly, you had gotten a little distracted by the idea that it had simply been a mistake to send someone like Sims to question you. It had occurred to you that they might send someone out again later, but that was... <em>later!</em> Not the next few days like Erich is saying. Will you be able to hide from a full, real Inquisitor? Mr Kin isn’t even an Angel and he always seemed to know, and that’s not even mentioning the Mind magic that can actually search through memories. Even you can use some of that!

    “I suppose I wouldn’t be too concerned,” he continues, apparently misinterpreting your alarm. “They may be disorganized, but it is still early into the transition. There’s every chance they will manage to catch the betrayer before the end of the year now that they’re taking it seriously. And with so many eyes around, I doubt you’ll be in danger again before it happens.”

    “That’s not what I was worried about,” you absolutely do not say. Instead, just another little nod of affirmation.

    Since you don’t really have anything else important to do tonight, you and Erich just set up in the common area and work on magic together. Since it’s not physical, you don’t have to worry about any collateral damage, and as a bonus, you can wrangle some of your friends into helping whenever they infrequently show up.

She graduated just this May, in fact, but you were a little distracted by the aftermath from your practical at the time and hadn’t paid much attention. But now as a full Angel - and one focused intently on physical combat, at that - she’s been out on a number of extermination missions all throughout the city. According to Yara, she’s been having fun, but she wouldn’t admit that.

    Today, she does not look like she’s having fun. When you look up and meet her eyes, she rolls them and changes course to head over to your table. “Jess,” she says in greeting. “<em>Mr</em> Haskell.”

    “Hey,” you reply. Erich doesn’t say anything; they don’t really get along. “Something going on out there?”

    “Inquisitors.” She sighs and sits down, revealing a hefty slice through her uniform as it flexes. The wound beneath has already been healed. She must have been on a mission not long before. “Someone big and angry caught me just after I came back and said she wanted to ask me about that boulder incident again. Y’know, Jess? Your experiment?”

    “Y-yeah. I know.”

    “Thought they were done the first time they asked, but <em>apparently</em> it didn’t count ‘cause the previous guy wasn’t good enough or something. <em>This</em> time they wanted to do a whole Mind-read thing when I said I didn’t see the guy, and you know what you can’t do?”

    “Wh-”

    “Say no to an Inquisitor. What a pain.” She drums her fingers on the table. “Anyway, just wanted t’let you know. Maybe Mind people like you are more used to that sorta thing, but I don’t like it. Already told the last guy all the same stuff. Whatever.”

    “...”

    “Oh yeah, you actually did see the guy, Jess.” Etalyn smirks, but in a sympathetic way. Probably. “I bet they’re gonna really dig around in your head. You think the last prime did this stuff too and they just covered it up, or you think the new one is just this serious about gettin’ the betrayer when he said?”

    “Yeah, me too. Alright, see ya later. I’m gonna go lie down. Missions really tire you out; enjoy not havin’ any.”

    “... S-see you...”

    “Ouch,” Erich says once she’s gone, in a rare display of not-entirely-formal language. “I only heard they were going to re-interview people; I didn’t think they were using Mind magic. I suppose it only makes sense, though. If you have the ability.”

    “... Yeah, it does.”

    You’re too distracted to focus much more and call it a night not long after. You’ve got to do something about all your incriminating memories, immediately. And probably Naoriel’s, too.

    <em>Scene 177</em>
    ...

    You wake up in the morning confused, with a throbbing headache and no memory of last night. You vaguely remember talking with Erich, and Etalyn had been there too for a bit... but that’s it. Nothing else. Even the memories you do have are vague; almost blurry. What... happened?

    As you stumble out of bed and rub your eyes against the headache, you notice a neatly folded note on your nightstand. Your mood improves slightly when you recognize your own handwriting: “Note to future me: you were practicing Mind magic with Erich last night and overdid it a little. I don’t think you’ll be able to remember much of the night, but it’s nothing to be worried about; the memories should come back in a week or two. No need to bother anyone else about it unless it doesn’t get better by then. Sorry! -past you”

    Ah. Well, that answers that question, you suppose. It... does sort of seem like something you would do. Practice a curse on yourself since you don’t want to hurt anyone else, screw it up, and lose a few hours of memory? You’re not entirely sure how you would have remembered enough to write that note, but suppose you’ll figure it out later, when your memories return.

    ... Your mood is curiously neutral today. But maybe that’s to be expected. You really hope it won’t take the full time your past self estimated to recover. You feel weird.

    Nothing out of the ordinary happens for the rest of the day. You kind of float through your courses, talk with Erich briefly to confirm that yes, you were indeed practicing Mind magic with him last night, and unexpectedly run into Etalyn shortly after dinner. But all she wants is to ask if you talked to an Inquisitor today, which you haven’t. Off she goes. How strange.

As Etalyn had apparently expected, a second Inquisitor pulls you out of an afternoon course and asks a few more questions. This one is much more thorough than Sims, and at the end of telling him again about everything you saw during the boulder incident, he says he’s going to view your memories of it, just to get any extra details. You’re a little uncomfortable, but there’s nothing you can really do to say no, so you just try to relax as best you can and think through what happened.

    The purifier Angel, almost certainly a disguise. The second one, probably an illusion. The boulder; Naoriel. Your friends arriving to help move it and perform the healing. Staring at the deep, dark blood left on the ground. Reminding you of the cistern; the shade; your miserable imprisonment. Wondering if you’ve been tainted; if you’ll end up betrayed or the betrayer. Wondering if you’ve become lesser; if you aren’t quite a full Angel anymore.

    The Inquisitor shifts in your Mind, drawing attention to the connections you just formed. Why did you think of that? What links those events? Is it just the trauma? The fear? Injury and possible death? Or...?

    A seal strains; breaks under his power. Linked by an individual, memories return. Exhaustive researching, checking, and cross-referencing Cathedra records. Taking matters into your own hands when the then-prime wouldn’t help you. Eventually reaching a conclusion that the betrayer and Archangel Maede Kamiya are one and the same.

    You flinch, closing off your Mind and ejecting the Inquisitor. “Wh - huh? Whose... were those <em>my</em> memories? I don’t... why didn’t I-”

    “Your memories had been suppressed, but it was inexpertly done. I removed the block.”

    “... I don’t - was that the - did you fix everything? Do I have anything else that’s-”

If you want anything more, talk to the hospital. Now, do you know anything else about Archangel Kamiya?”

    “N-no; or... I don’t <em>think</em> so?”

    “Focus on the question. Open your Mind.”

    In the end, the Inquisitor only finds one more blocked memory, this time linking Kamiya to pressing worries about half-Angels. Yourself, from your time in the cistern, or further evidence of her betrayal? You’re still worried about other suppressed memories, especially given your recent bout of amnesia, but he just doesn’t seem interested in anything but the information he’s searching for. Specifically, knowledge of the betrayer. You prove only moderately helpful there, unable to answer why exactly you decided to do all this research, but again he doesn’t seem to care.

    “I only have discretion to search for memories of the betrayer’s identity and known incidents,” the Inquisitor tells you after a particularly strong question. “Anything more would be a breach of privacy. I will report what I found to the prime and - should he order it - may return to investigate further. In the meantime, I again recommend you visit the healers under Aveline to restore any additionally suppressed memories. And of course, if you recover anything of importance, tell us immediately.”

    “... Okay...” You have to wonder if this is a new policy; part of the accountability measures touted by the new prime? Or maybe the Inquisitors have always been like this and were just too secretive to reveal it.

It’s evening now and you don’t feel any better with the partially recovered memories. If anything, it’s just made you more aware of the gaps you’re absolutely certain are still present. You almost take his advice and go to the hospital right away, but after some debate with yourself decide to at least have dinner first. You don’t like doctors and going there on an empty stomach would just make it worse.

    Unusually, Etalyn approaches you again after dinner. Again, she only has one question for you: “Did you talk to an Inquisitor today?”

    This time, you say “Yes.”

    “Great. You told me to tell you ‘Seth is seven inches taller’ once that happened. Real urgent about it, too. Wanna explain why?”

    “No he isn’t-”

    “... Jess?”

    You clutch your head with another brutal headache as memories rearrange themselves. Seth <em>is</em> seven inches taller; you learned that on Endle Day this year. But, more to the point, that was a trigger. A trigger <em>you</em> set. A trigger to recover not just your memories of Naoriel, her heritage, and her connection with Kamiya, but also the fact that you did this at all! Images of burning, smothering hands pressing on your Mind - your <em>own</em> hands, suppressing your <em>own</em> memories of the procedure itself as you operated.

    It all returns in a rush.

    “Jess, say something. You’re worryin’ me here.”

    “I-I’m okay...”

    You asked Etalyn to check on you with the trigger phrase every day. She had already had her second interview, so wouldn’t risk revealing your deception. But she didn’t know; she doesn’t know. You need to find Naoriel; check if she’s had her second interview yet. You-

    <em>Scene 178</em>
    “...”

    You can’t. You’ve been hiding this for months - <em>years?</em> - now. You’d only put them in more danger, especially if anything goes wrong and Mind-reading comes into play again. It’s not even your secret to reveal.

    And yet.

    You and Naoriel can’t do this on your own. If the Inquisitors come back in a matter of days or hours to take her away for execution, you won’t be able to stop them. You need help. You have to trust someone.

    The cards. The fallen Angel. A secret. Betrayal. You try to push that paranoia aside. “... Okay. I could really use the help, honestly.”

    “Great! So, what do ya need?”

    You can’t tell her <em>now,</em> though. Alongside the somewhat public setting, Naoriel’s heritage isn’t something you can just spread around without her permission. She has to make that decision. “We need to find Naoriel. Like, right now.”

    “Her? What for?”

    “I... can’t tell you. Not until we find her, okay?”

    “Well,” she says. “If it’s important, then sure.”

    “It’s really, <em>really</em> important.”

    “Then let’s get moving!”

    You get moving, and even split up after cluing Yara in on the search to track her down faster. You’re reminded of the time you, Serri, and Etalyn went looking for Yara after dark, though now with the participants slightly rearranged. That time, you found him in Hearth Hall having simply stayed in Forger Hall a little longer; he ended up being totally fine. This time, you can only hope for the same outcome. Surely they wouldn’t have arrested Naoriel already. Surely they would have announced something if they had caught Kamiya.

    And, after about half an hour looking around the Cathedra, it turns out that’s correct. Etalyn ends up being the one to find her, late for dinner after an extended interview with an Inquisitor. You run to meet them in a partial panic, worrying about how many of your patches held or didn’t, but the fact that she’s here at all means enough of them did to avert disaster.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1294097782176485511 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1294097782176485511><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, October 10, 2024 8:42 PM">8:42 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>You say the trigger phrase to her as well - you used the same one just in case something happened to you and Etalyn had to fix things herself - and drag everyone back to your room while she recovers her memories. There, you leave Yara and Etalyn outside to guard the door while you and Naoriel briefly swap information - her Inquisitor got much the same information as yours for the same reasons - and agree that things have gone too far. You need help.

    So. You invite them back in. Clear your throat. Wonder how in the world you’re going to explain all this. “Okay, I know this is going to be hard to explain and hard to believe, and I really <em>really</em> need you to agree to not tell anyone about this-” You pause and wait for acknowledgement. “-but... er...”

    “I’m a half-Angel,” Naoriel blurts out. “My father is the former prime of Inquisition and my mother is Archangel Kamiya.”

    Silence.

    “I <em>knew</em> something strange was going on with you two,” Yara exclaims with somewhat too much energy for such a serious situation. “Our dear Jessamine was the one to first inform me of the existence of half-Angels in the first place, you know. And now I understand why exactly you were so keen to learn about them.”

    “Hold on,” Etalyn says. “Angels can’t have kids. How’d this happen? And why are you two so freaked out about it?”

    So Yara did keep it a secret, after all. Of course he did; you can trust him. “W-well...”

    You and Naoriel explain, in brief. That humans and Angels <em>can</em> have children together, despite what the Cathedra claims. That such hybrids have unstable Souls due to their mixed heritage. That Erejil was a half-Angel. That the Cathedra captures and executes half-Angels - even children - along with their parents as a protective measure against such devastation ever happening again. And... well, actually...

We just need another month or so to prepare, and with the Inquisition moving so fast, I don’t know if we’re even going to have another <em>day</em>.”

    “You solved it?” Etalyn asks, incredulous. “Two trainees managed to crack what the Cathedra hasn’t in centuries? What is this grand plan of yours?”

    You’ve put a  lot of trust in them, and Yara even knows you can talk to shades, but there&#39;s no way you should reveal what you plan to do. It’s just too crazy. “I’m sorry, but we can’t-”

    “Jessamine is going to help a shade operate on me.”

    You stare at her in shock. Then, nervously, look over at-

    “Are you insane? A shade?!”

    “I-I know what it sounds like,” you stammer, forced into explaining. “But... there’s one in particular I’ve talked to several times now...”

    It feels like you’re looking at yourself from the outside as you keep talking, growing more and more anxious by the second. Watching some dumb, trusting girl spill all her secrets to people who have no choice but to betray her. What else can they do? Just <em>let</em> you go do whatever this shade - the enemy of all humanity - wants?

    “It... does seem a little far-fetched,” Yara says uncertainly once you’re done. “You don’t really have any assurance that this shade is telling the truth. What does it have to gain by helping you, when it could gain <em>two</em> fallen Angels by corrupting you?”

    No; no no no. Don’t ask that question. You know what it stands to gain-

    The sin. You <em>know.</em> Strings, in this very room. You could cut them. You could you could you <em>could.</em> You can <em>see</em> them, curling from the puppets before you intangibly into the ceiling. It would be so easy to just reach out and...

    <em>CONTROL YOURSELF.</em>

    Little by little, the sin drops out of your Mind. Naoriel is talking. Something about the shade. “Strings,” she says. The sin. You understand. You can. You must.

    You stand up. The sin fills your Mind.

    ...

    You let out a gasp, blanking out for a moment as you forget what it was you just knew in such perfect clarity. You’re trembling. “I’m fine,” you wheeze as you try to refill your lungs. Something bubbles within you. “J-just... er, m-my sickness. Give m-me a minute, please...”

    Three concerned Angels watch as you quietly leave your room. It’s not your sickness, or at least you don’t think it is. It’s some kind of compulsion. Ever since you cut your strings...

    It takes you a few minutes to calm down, but once you do, you sit there (just down the hall from your room) for a minute longer. You just can’t go back in yet. What if you go crazy again? What if you try to hurt someone? ... What if you <em>succeed?</em>

    “Jessamine?”

    You look up. Erich is approaching from the stairwell. “Huh? What are you doing here?”

    “That’s not very polite to say to someone you agreed to meet downstairs ten minutes ago.”

    “H-huh? Did I?”

    “To continue with Mind magic? Did something come up? I heard you were looking for Naoriel recently.”

    “I - er - so sorry; I must have forgot... y-yeah, with Naoriel... I... need to reschedule, okay? Can I talk to you later?”

    “Of course.” A brief pause. “This certainly seems stressful, whatever is going on. Involving Naoriel and Inquisitors... and potentially Mind magic, given Etalyn’s similarly strange behavior.”

    “...” He’s perceptive. Dangerously so, perhaps.

    “But I’m sure you wouldn’t be hiding anything from the Inquisitors, would you?”

    “... Of course not!”

    You’re such a bad liar. You know this. Erich knows this. How you got away with it during your two interviews is a mystery; maybe it’s <em>because</em> they used Mind magic instead of just talking to you. But Erich knows you fairly well by now. He knows. He-

    <em>Scene 179</em>
    You want to trust him. It’s so hard to keep lying to everyone. You just made the choice to finally tell Yara and Etalyn; it should be fine! Erich isn’t a bad guy!

    But...

    “I can’t tell you. Not right now. By... by the end of the year, I can,” you decide. “By then, it’ll be okay. But right now, I just can’t say anything.”

    “...”

    What’s that look in his eyes? “Please don’t say anything to anyone. I just need a few months and then I can explain. Okay? Just a little longer...”

    “... Alright,” he says. “A few months? I’ll be waiting, then. Don’t get yourself hurt, understand?”

    “I...” You can’t promise that. It should be the easiest thing in the world to agree to, but you just can’t; it’s simply not true. You’re risking so much. “I’ll try.”

    “Very well, then. We’ll talk in Cevember. Or earlier.”

    He returns downstairs. You feel sick. Images of the cards dance in your Mind; you’ve long since given up trying to disbelieve the fortune. The betrayal is close. It <em>has</em> to be. But will it be him? You can’t know.

    “She returns,” Yara notes as you re-enter your room, somehow relaxed enough to lean back in his chair. “Feeling alright?”

    “... Physically? Yeah. I’m okay.” A pause. You don’t want to mention Erich. “Did I miss anything?”

    “We’re just trying to decide what to do,” Naoriel says, <em>also</em> looking surprisingly calm. Are you the only one who feels so nervous you could throw up? Or are they just hiding it? “If the Inquisitors know about Kamiya, they’re going to try to capture her soon. And when they do, she’s going to tell them about me. We just don’t know when that will be.”

    “The way I see it, we have a few bad options.” Yara counts them out on his fingers as he continues. “One. I’m not saying we <em>should</em>, but we’re brainstorming here; everything’s on the table. We could turn Naoriel in. The three of us would be fine, but... dear Ms Fisher would certainly not be. But it would at least prevent an Erejil-style catastrophe, guaranteed.”

    “Sure. I don’t like it either. Two, then. Your friendly shade has said three months is the minimum time to wait before doing the operation. That puts it at November 13th, just over a month away. And, inconveniently, there aren’t any holidays in November, so the earliest day you could do it without causing a ruckus would be December 3rd, Sequence Day.”

    “That’s... a long time to wait when they could come after us <em>tomorrow.”</em>

    “Indeed. Three. Now we’re starting to get into some truly dangerous plans.”

    “‘Two’ wasn’t dangerous enough?” you mutter.

    “Three: Naoriel leaves the Cathedra and hides somewhere in the city until the three months are up. This would obviously cause a huge disturbance and Angels would comb the city looking for you. I’m not certain how you would be able to hide for that long, especially without our help - as, of course, we couldn’t know where you went or we would certainly be forced to reveal that information. But it would at least get you away from immediate danger quickly.”

    Naoriel shifts uncomfortably. You don’t like this one either. Yara had called all of them “bad options,” you suppose.

    “Three-B,” he continues. “We fake Naoriel’s death, and then follow plan three. The advantages are obvious: no one would be searching for a presumably dead Angel. However, how to do so convincingly, and in such a way to avoid problematic investigations... is a fairly difficult problem.”

    “If... if we can figure out how to do it, that might be okay...” you say quietly. It’s starting to sink in just how few and how risky your options are.

Was I on five? Whatever; five: we do this operation early. I can’t pretend to know what risks are associated with not waiting the full time, and by what you’ve said, I don’t believe you two know either. As an aside, by the way, I still don’t exactly trust this shade and its mysterious ‘operation,’ but these plans are operating on the assumption that it is in fact trustworthy. If it isn’t, then we really only have plan one available as we can’t cure Naoriel. Which is why we’re assuming it’s fine.”

    “...” You don’t know how to address the aside, so you just speak to the first part of that. “I can maybe try to ask it what happens if we rush, but my guess is that her Soul will break. The way it talked about the operation made it seem like it’s a really delicate procedure that needs careful balance. I wouldn’t want to do it with an unstable Soul...”

    Naoriel nods. “I still don’t feel... quite right, yet. I don’t want to risk that...”

    “Very well! Then, it seems we have two main problems. Namely, that we cannot attempt to cure Naoriel until mid-November, and she cannot be within reach of the Inquisition between now and then. So if we don’t intend to bargain with the Inquisitors or seek help from anyone else in the Cathedra - either of which I would find quite dangerous - it seems our choices are essentially how to get you out of the Cathedra, where to go, and how to meet up later to perform the operation.”

    Something occurs to you. “If I go with her, we wouldn’t have to meet up later. I could just do it then, before we come back.”

    Everyone seems taken aback by this. “Y-you want to go with her? Jessamine, that’s quite admirable, but-” Yara shakes his head. “Apologies; this is a brainstorming session. Quite right; you could go with her. But having two Angels disappear - or ‘die’ - at once would only add to the complications. Hmm...”

    “...” You try to visualize what that would be like, if you couldn’t come back here. If the Cathedra branded you a traitor. Would your life just be painfully cut short by an Inquisitor’s execution? Would you spend years on the run, hiding throughout the city or the wastes to avoid detection? Would you be branded a hero instead, for discovering how to cure half-Angels? Would everything be forgiven?

    “Ah, it’s already getting quite late,” Yara notes as the night bell gongs sonorously through the mist. “I would ordinarily suggest we sleep on any major decisions like this, but if we’re worried about a matter of hours, there may not be time.”

    Etalyn’s been awfully quiet over there in the corner, you note. She doesn’t seem happy. She usually doesn’t, but...

    The cards. Fortune. Destiny. Betrayal.

    <em>Scene 180</em>
    In the end, you sleep on it. Poorly. But you need to ask the shade some questions first.

    You’re not sure how to “summon” it into your dreams, and you’re not convinced you even can. Every time it’s shown up, it’s been on its terms. So you just do what seems natural and think about it a lot, hoping that there’s some sort of mystical connection you can form and that it isn’t just some spell it has to cast, completely separate from anything you’re doing.

    Whatever the case, it seems to work. You appear in the cistern, standing in the cool, thigh-deep water at the bottom of the pit. Gentle currents pull you towards the center, where the floor drops away into darkness. You hurriedly back out of the water and onto dry land, fully aware you’re dreaming and trying your best to ignore the uncomfortable surroundings to search for the shade.

    “Events have moved quickly,” it hisses from somewhere above you. Silver eyes gleam in the shadows.

    You’ve rarely been so relieved to see your ostensible mortal enemy. At least it’s not the orange-eyed one. “Yeah. Yes, they have. Er, d-did I bring you here, or did you come on your own...?”

    “It has its informants. It believes the cut-string puppet might require guidance.”

    “That’s one way to put it...” You glance around again, not finding anyone else. “Did you not bring Naoriel here too?”

    The shade’s eyes shift upwards slightly. “The broken puppet is not asleep.”

    “What? I told her - ugh, she’d better be rested by morning! Anyway, we’re trying to make a plan and I need to know a few things.”

    “Speak. Ask.”

    “Well...”

    ...

    You’re awake before the morning bell and meet up with your co-conspirators in the misty chill of sunrise to finalize the plan. Then, as light turns the fog gold, you put it into place.

You and Naoriel wait a few more minutes before following suit, walking in on the three of them in the middle of a lively conversation about how well Clarity could impersonate Etalyn with her transmutation magic. Just as “coincidentally,” you join up with the group and Naoriel ends up agreeing to be the test subject.

    After breakfast, Clarity tries a few disguises before getting it almost exactly right on the fourth try, resulting in two near-identical Etalyns regarding each other with very different expressions. At that point, Yara suggests they go see if anyone will notice a difference based on personality alone... but Clarity has to go to the Center for a meeting. She leaves the disguise up and hurries off.

    Without much time to spare before the transmutation fades, you place your own disguise projection over Naoriel, layering it on top of the transmutation to result in a human-looking Etalyn. Yara does the same for himself and the two head for the front gate as if they’re going out on a mission together - they often do. Meanwhile, you and the <em>real</em> Etalyn walk over to a secluded corner of the Cathedra grounds behind a temple dedicated to the concept of change.

    “Wall’s a little lower here,” she says by way of explanation. “Back in a bit.”

A monk rounds the corner into view in a few moments, checking on the loud, alarm-like <em>ding</em> the wall magically gives off when anyone touches it, but by then you’re alone and innocently backing away as if you had just leaned on it without thinking. There’s no way Naoriel could have vaulted the wall like that. Honestly, you’d think there’s no way Etalyn could have done it if you hadn’t just watched her. Unbelievable.

    After a minute more to placate the monk, you head back to the main gates and confirm the non-presence of any sort of kerfuffle. Beautiful. For such a convoluted plan, everything seems to have worked out perfectly. No one should notice she’s gone until tomorrow, or possibly even Monday when she has courses again.

    A few hours later, Yara and the real Etalyn return to the Cathedra. He just nods with a wry little smile as proof that nothing went wrong. Naoriel is out there in the city somewhere, on her own. And none of you have any idea where she’s going, so you can’t betray her even if you wanted to.

    <em>Now</em> comes the hard part: waiting here for a month and a half without knowing how she’s doing or if she’s even alive. Hoping to hear back just before it’s time to perform the procedure. And not telling anyone a single thing about what’s going on.

Even though you hopefully can’t know where Naoriel is planning to go, you certainly have plenty of other incriminating memories. Chief among them are your several talks with the shade. Maybe the Inquisitors won’t look for those purposefully due to their privacy restrictions, but last night’s conversation in particular is far too connected to Naoriel for your comfort. So, you’re going to try to completely extract that memory so you can’t possibly give anything away. You might lose it if you screw up, but... that’s what writing it down is for. You don’t need to remember the atmosphere or details; just the facts.

    Unfortunately, you’ve been so busy this morning that you haven’t had time to gather the ingredients yet, and your instructors typically aren’t around on Saturdays. So it’s slow going picking through the storerooms with the help of the monks who are still here, searching for materials that hopefully don’t look too suspicious. Once you’re done with that, you’ll just need an hour or two to prepare before you can-

    “Angel Jessamine Goodall?”

    You just about jump out of your skin as a muscular Inquisitor places his hand on your shoulder. Two Cathedra guards accompany him.

    “Y-yes...?”

    “I’m afraid you’ll need to come with me. We have some questions for you.”

    Ah. Not so perfect after all.

    <em>Scene 181</em>
    You’re escorted down to the basement of Illim Hall, led into a small, metal-lined room that reminds you of a jail cell, and asked about Naoriel. When you won’t say anything useful, the Inquisitor instead attempts to view your memories. When you won’t cooperate with that either, refusing to allow him into your Mind despite several attempts, he leaves along with the guards.

    Several hours pass.

    You pace around the room. Knock on the door. Ask the guard outside when you can leave. He doesn’t know. Ask why you’re being held here. He says you just need to answer the questions and you can go. Say you aren’t going to do that. He says he’ll tell them.

    Several. Hours. Pass.

    You end up lightly dozing in one of the chairs, just because there isn’t anything else to do. This is reminding you uncomfortably of your imprisonment in the cistern, and you feel like you might just start breaking things if they don’t let you out soon. Or at least indicate that <em>something</em> is happening. They can’t just hold you here forever without <em>saying</em> anything, right? You’re an Angel, and they can’t even do this to a regular human! Right?

    Voices in the hallway. You hurry to the door and peek out.

    The new prime of Inquisition is walking quickly towards you, accompanied by another Inquisitor you vaguely recognize but don’t know well. At least they’ve started wearing those badges so you can tell who is one on sight. The prime is speaking to the guard in front of your room (you’re trying to avoid the word “cell,” even in your thoughts), telling him to get the door open. Keys jangle. You try to prepare yourself.

    The prime enters, followed by his Inquisitor guard. The door shuts. He regards you.

    “Jessamine Goodall,” he says. You don’t like his voice. It’s harsh, but dull. Monotonously threatening. Dangerous. “Do you know why you are here?”

Besides, you’re kind of sick of all the lying. “Because I won’t tell you anything about Naoriel.” Your voice is even; hardly shaking at all. Good. You’ll need that strength.

    “Correct.” The prime pulls out a chair and sits, but he doesn’t gesture for you to take a seat. You remain standing, not wanting to get any closer. “Just yesterday, we made a breakthrough on the betrayer case. The suspect is in custody. And she had some very interesting things to tell us about Mr Kin and his illicit daughter.”

    He watches for a reaction. You knew all this already - or at least had guessed - so it’s not as hard as you thought to remain outwardly neutral.

    “I’m not here to play around, Goodall.” You blink, kind of surprised at the use of your last name. Not many people use it on its own. “The suspected half-Angel Naoriel Fisher has gone missing. You are one of her close associates, and based on various reports and collected evidence, we believe you helped her escape. It’s a simple question. Where is she?”

    “I don’t know.” It’s the truth. Mostly.

    He obviously expected that. “Do you know what a half-Angel is? Do you have any idea what kind of madness you’re going to be responsible for with this ‘kind-hearted’ stunt?” The prime rubs the bridge of his nose, seeming equal parts exhausted and menacing. “Of course you do. You did a project on false Angel Erejil, for God’s sake. You know what you’re doing. Or at least you think you do.”

    “...”

She may be your friend now, but when her Soul starts to break, she will turn on you and everyone else in the city. Withholding information will get innocent civilians <em>and</em> your fellow Angels killed. Where is she?”

    “I don’t know.”

    “Fine. When did she leave?”

    This, you do know. But you don’t want to say it. Naoriel needs all the time she can get to find a hiding place; Angels are no doubt already searching for her. “I don’t know.”

    “You do.” Another sigh. Another few questions. You don’t tell him anything.

    “... Why do you think I came here personally, Goodall? Just to have fun playing word games with you? No. It’s because I hold the authority to investigate all corruption in the Cathedra. You may not be corrupted by darkness, but hiding critical information is corruption all the same. We cannot have corrupted Angels in our ranks.”

    Images of the guillotine seep into your Mind. “You can’t kill me,” you murmur, really hoping you’re right.

    “If you’re a danger to the Cathedra, we can and will.”

    “...” He’s lying. He has to be.

    ... But what if he isn’t?

    “But enough about that. You’ll come around. And in the meantime, let’s talk about some other friends of yours.” The prime smiles coldly as he retrieves a slip of paper from a pocket and skims it briefly. “Yara Conner and Etalyn Mills, suspected of aiding in the escape of suspected half-Angel Naoriel Fisher. Detained for interrogation. And, unlike you, these particular Angels are both adults.”

    A chilling, shivering sensation. “What does that have to do with anything?”

All future missions will be beyond the wall, until Naoriel Fisher is captured. With their help or without it.”

    “You... you can’t do that. They’re not trained for the wastelands; that’s-”

    “A death sentence? Good. You understand the gravity of the situation.”

    <em>Now</em> you’re scared. Not for yourself, but...

    “If you decide to share any information on the half-Angel, this will of course be taken into account for their assignments. Adequate assistance may result in a reversal of this decision.”

    They’re going to die if you don’t say anything. Or Naoriel’s going to die if you do. Guilt; you <em>knew</em> getting them involved was a terrible idea! At least before, when it came to this, only you would be in trouble!

    “Do you happen to remember anything of use now, or shall I check back after their first mission to the wastes?”

    <em>Scene 182</em>
    “...”

    You consider saying something; you really do. Being sent to the wastes... if you could maybe help them escape that fate by just providing a little information, would it be worth it? But, after thinking a few moments, you realize that if what he’s saying is true, that means Yara and Etalyn didn’t say anything either. They have the same information on Naoriel as you do, <em>and they didn’t talk.</em> So, if you did now, you’d be betraying them just as much as Naoriel herself. Well, maybe a little less, but still.

    So. You stay quiet.

    “Fine. Then you get to stay right here until you change your Mind. We’ll check back in a few days.”

    The prime stands to leave. You say nothing. Maybe he wants you to get upset about being stuck here, but it’s not going to be nearly as bad as the cistern. At least here, you won’t be forced to operate on anyone.

    ...

    You dream of the shade that night, briefly. It appears for only a few moments, just long enough to whisper “she still lives” and vanish back into the formless shadows that are your backdrop tonight. It didn’t agree to ferry messages back and forth for you, and it wouldn’t be a good idea anyway if the Inquisitors do get you to break, but this was the only way you could think of to make sure she’s still okay without risking interception. Even Angels can’t interrupt whatever strange, dream-based spell the shade is using here. Not if they don’t know about it.

    It’s a relief in any case. She’s still okay, which means they weren’t able to track her directly. If they had, it would have been over already. Now, it turns into hide-and-seek rather than a direct chase. Better for you; better for her. Can she make it a month? You can only hope.

    ... Can <em>you</em> make it a month? Can Yara? Etalyn?

    You can only hope. Or, perhaps, pray.

Can we save her?</em>

    God, as always, does not answer. You aren’t the Emissary. He will not speak to you.

    But... the Emissary <em>is</em> the Emissary. He <em>can</em> speak to God, at least to some degree. And he commands the primes. So... indirectly, does that mean that God <em>doesn’t</em> approve of your actions? Since He would have told the Emissary, who would have told the prime, who would have told the Inquisitors? Or does He not think the situation is worth commenting on? Is it too insignificant; beneath His notice? Does He not have enough of a Mind left to make these comments, like you’ve wondered before?

    Or is the Emissary ignoring Him?

    Occasionally, you have wondered if the Emissary really can speak to God. If Angels can’t - even Seraphim don’t have that ability - what is it about this mortal man that raises him above everyone else? He <em>is</em> human; there’s no physical difference. The only thing different about the Emissary is that he’s elected by the primes, and that he’s the keeper of the Lordstone. The shard of God’s Body entrusted to the Cathedra that forms its link with the divine. Is that it? But how <em>is</em> he connected to the Lordstone, actually? Just by sitting next to it all day? Would anyone sitting in his chair be able to talk to God, or is there something special you just don’t know about? There probably is; the Cathedra likes keeping secrets.

    But if you accept that the Emissary can speak to God and that he accurately carries His will into the world, then you’d have to accept that God wants you to fail. Wants Naoriel to die.

    You can’t accept that.

At least one part of that statement has to be false. Either the Emissary can’t speak to God... or he’s ignoring Him. One of those has to be true. You’re sure of it. And you’ve seen the Lordstone; you know it is a real, legitimately magical artifact. You’re not completely sure it’s actually part of God’s Body, but it shines with brilliant warmth in the Soul aspect. It <em>is</em> powerful. You don’t have any distinct reason to <em>dis</em>believe it.

    And, to be honest, the Emissary has kind of creeped you out before. That unnaturally perceptive gaze; the strange way of speaking. The irises of pure gold, the color of powerful magic.

    The silver-eyed shade. The golden-eyed Emissary.

    “...?” You’re not really sure what to make of that connection, but it seems important.

    ...

    “Miss Angel?” the guard calls in, knocking on your door. “Are you awake?”

    You had covered yourself entirely in blankets sometime overnight, trying to block the noise and light from the hall, so he can’t currently see you. Bleary; tired. Annoyed; anxious. You’re not in a good mood this morning, to say the least. “What?” you grumble, sitting up and letting bedding tumble to the floor.

    “You’re, um, free to go.” He clicks the door open and peeks in, smiling nervously when he catches sight of you. “Just got word a minute ago.”

    “What?” you repeat, though less grumpily this time. “Are you serious? I thought the prime said I’d be stuck here.”

    “Apparently that decision was reversed early this morning. I don’t really know, but if you don’t want to leave-”

    “No! No; I’ll leave!” You leap up and hurry past him into the hall, before he can change his Mind. There’s no one else here. No Inquisitors; no primes; no one. “Really? Just... completely free?”

    “Er, he did want me to give you these instructions, though. I think you’re supposed to check in with someone every so often, to... make sure you, er...”

    The guard nods.

    “Well, er, thanks.” And off you go, down the excessively long hallway. Aware that the guard could be watching you walk aaaallllll the way to the staircase.

    But then, after another few minutes navigating the turns of Illim Hall’s first floor, you’re finally back out into fresh air. It’s midmorning and chilly, but you don’t have time to worry about the weather. You have to figure out what in the world happened while you were down there. And you <em>definitely</em> have to find out where Yara and Etalyn went.

    ... And you probably have to go to the Center soon. Every four hours? What if you’re trying to sleep?!

    <em>Scene 183</em>
    <em>Earlier...</em>

    “I suppose this is where we part ways, then.”

    You nod, trusting Yara to read the disguise’s integrity better than you can. In a few seconds, as he noted, it falls apart. You quickly wrap a scarf around your face to cover your Angelic features. “Thanks,” you say, muffled by the fabric. “I know you’re risking a lot to help me.”

    “Hum. So we are. If you want to truly thank me, though, do it by surviving and returning healthy, when the time is right. And do try to avoid turning to the corruption and making us all look like fools, if you can.” A wry grin, but there’s more than a hint of legitimate concern there too. “Good luck.”

    “... I’ll do my best.”

    He nods, seeming to consider that matter closed. “Well. See you in a few months. I had better get back before anyone misses me.”

    He turns and walks away, not looking back.

    Breathe.

    Your name is Naoriel Fisher, trainee Angel. Half-Angel. And now, fugitive from the Cathedra. You check your appearance in a nearby window, making sure you’re covered up enough to look human unless anyone looks <em>too</em> closely at your unnaturally purple eyes. Good enough. Time to hurry.

    Yara can’t help you anymore. Nor can Etalyn, or even Jessamine. She would have come with you, you’re certain, if it would have made sense. It’s still a mystery why she’s gone to such incredible lengths just to try and save you. Even working with a shade...

    Shake those thoughts out of your head. You need to move. If all goes well, no one will come looking for you until Monday, but you’re well aware that’s optimistic. Angels could already be forming search parties to find you, so you need to get out of sight as soon as you possibly can. But that’s going to be tricky.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1297627054791069738 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1297627054791069738><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, October 20, 2024 2:26 PM">2:26 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>You couldn’t plan with Jess or anyone else, since they’re staying behind and knowing where you plan to go is too much of a risk if the Inquisition catches them. They did give you some money, but that’s about it. You can’t use disguise magic on your own, or really any spells of much use beyond a few smaller flame bursts or the like. Your Soul is too broken for that. So you just need to hide the old fashioned way, where nobody will think to look and nobody will be able to detect you just by flying overhead. You’re well aware of how powerful simply <em>looking</em> in the Soul aspect can be, even though you’re very bad at it. Jess can see you from hundreds of feet away, including through walls, if she’s careful. Inquisitors will likely be even more effective, though hopefully not <em>that</em> much more given her unusually strong sensitivity to Soul.

    Anyway, you need to get underground as quickly as you possibly can - literally. That’s why you’re currently buying a ticket on the express train direct to the tenth district, and why you already have a destination in Mind. Namely, you’re going to a mine.

    It makes sense. You need to get underground, and they’re always hiring. Smaller workers are in especially high demand to get into tight spaces, and you’re a perfect fit. You’re not quite 16, but with your Angelic slow aging, you’re slightly smaller than a normal girl your age would be. Of course, you don’t have any parents or documentation available to prove you’re allowed to work... but one step at a time. You’ve got a plan for that. It’s not a <em>good</em> plan, but it is <em>a</em> plan. Besides, you really can’t afford to get rejected anywhere in case that leaves a trail for the Cathedra to pick up. So you might have to go somewhere that cares a little less about proper paperwork.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1297627117819002930 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1297627117819002930><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, October 20, 2024 2:26 PM">2:26 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The express train runs nonstop to the tenth district, so it’s not long at all before you’re walking away from the district’s central station and heading towards the wall. The tenth district is situated on the outskirts of the city and contains the entrance grates where the Endle River pours into the city. There are a lot of caverns near the river due to - mumble mumble hydrology or something; you don’t know - so there are a lot of mines nearby as well. The same situation is mirrored in the fourteenth district where the river flows out into the wastes, but the mines there are better regulated due to all the industry. Plus, you don’t want to go there since Jess was just... yeah, it wouldn’t be smart. Hopefully, there’s no immediate reason to expect you to go here.

    It takes you several hours to walk around the district, get some food and information, and scout out the possible locations that might be willing to hire you. All the while, you’re stealing glances at the sky and wondering when they’ll notice your absence. Without a good Soul sense, you probably won’t even notice your pursuers until it’s too late.

    ... Really, really hurry.

    Finally, by early afternoon, you feel confident enough in one small mine’s lax policies to try going in. You enter the run-down management building, inquire at the desk, and fill out some basic paperwork with names and addresses that you mostly just make up on the spot. They don’t ask for your parents’ approval - just their names - and don’t ask for any form of official ID. The manager comes out to look at you - a gruff, grizzled, greasy man that you immediately dislike - and sign his approval. “Good. You’re probably small ‘nough to get in the 800-shaft, easy. When d’ya want to start?”

    You try to look like someone who’s just desperate for money, not desperate to get away from the Cathedra. “Today?”

    “Ha! Good spirit! Get ‘er down there today.”

You go down there today. You aren’t allowed to wear your scarf into the mine due to flammability concerns (or something? He was talking very quickly) and you have to tie up your hair that could otherwise cover it. Luckily, you had thought of that previously and smudged up your face as best you could to try and conceal your features. Hopefully in the low light down below, it’ll be enough. Up here, you just try to stay out of direct sight as much as possible, keeping a careful lookout for anyone staring too long. This would be so much easier if you could just do a proper disguise, but it’s simply beyond your skill. Maybe the operation will fix that too and you can learn magic properly. Optimistic, but in a situation like this you <em>have</em> to be optimistic.

    Before the manager leaves you to your training, though, you should probably figure out where you’re going to sleep. You’d really like to stay underground even then, for safety, but you’d be hard-pressed to find any normal lodgings that aren’t on the surface...

    <em>Scene 184</em>
    You’ve never actually been in a mine, though Jess did that one time you all went out to various jobs throughout the city and told you about it. Although, now that you think about it, that wasn’t really a <em>mine</em> so much as an underground farm - she never went down to the real depths. Here, you <em>definitely</em> do. At least you’re certainly out of sight from any Angels searching for you above, though that’s small comfort as the elevator just keeps dropping lower and lower. It almost feels like you’re descending into your own grave.

    Finally, the descent stops and you follow the hairy older man who is your instructor into the network of cramped, hot, pitch-black tunnels. You’re both wearing headlamps, but it hardly makes a difference beyond a dozen or so feet. Side passages gape emptily in each wall and the main tunnel winds around massive chunks of solid rock a different color than the rest. You consider asking about them, but don’t want to draw attention to yourself and just stay silent.

    “This is the 800 level,” your instructor eventually says, slowing to a stop just ahead of another one of those stone chunks with a massive crack blasted through it. You can hear water trickling on the other side, which makes you very nervous. You don’t know much about caves, but the river is very nearby and you <em>know</em> it’s above you. The idea of the torrent’s full force flooding the mine...

    He retrieves a small item from a pocket before he continues explaining. It’s a little metallic orb about the size of a fingernail. Very shiny and a grainy greenish-silver color. “This is a fluxpearl. Used in manufacturing. Very expensive.”

    “Okay...”

    He takes the pearl back. “They form in streams like this. In rock like that.”

The crack is extremely narrow and winds crazily in multiple directions, with little dribbles of water seeping from even smaller cracks branching off the main one. You can’t see any pearls, but your light reflects strangely.

    “You’re small enough to fit in there. Yes?”

    You really, really don’t want to go in there. It’s so narrow and sharp rocks jut out at awkward angles. “... What if I get stuck?”

    “I’ll pull you out. Go on.”

    Maybe you didn’t quite think this plan all the way through. Gingerly, you grab onto the edges of the passage and squeeze inside, wiggling through the entryway until you’ve made it into the slightly larger area where water starts to drip. It’s a tight fit, but it is <em>a</em> fit. Water drums on your helmet and trickles down the back of your overalls. Something scuttles nearby and you suppress a shiver. “... Good?”

    “Good,” he says. “Now turn around and come out.”

    Easier said than done. You have to twist in awkward ways to change direction and keep bumping your head on rocks. Thank God for the helmet. But eventually, you manage to crawl back out and emerge into the slightly larger area of the main tunnel.

    The man nods. “Not scared of tight spaces, I see. That’s good.”

    “... Er-”

    “Not <em>too</em> scared.” He chuckles, once. A weird vocalization. “Everyone’s at least a little scared of the caves. Anyone who’s not is already gone.”

    “...”

    “Well, you fit. So let’s learn the equipment and techniques a little more. Then you can go find some pearls.”

Jabbed with rocks that seemed almost intentionally sharpened, though you’re assured they’re natural. Constantly fighting the urge to retreat out of the enclosed space that could become your tomb if the rock shifts or you make a wrong move or the water gets worse or <em>anything</em> else. Bugs, everywhere. You’ve never seen so many centipedes, and once you got further from the entrance, you turned on your Angelic glow to scare them off. Jess told you about that, and it was nearly the only relief you had that whole time.

    You’re exhausted and sore and just about ready to cry when you consider that you aren’t going back to a nice hot shower and a nice warm bed. No, you thought about that when you were down there; you can’t stay in any aboveground lodging overnight. What if Inquisitors fly out after dark looking for you? You have to stay below, which... which probably means finding a nondescript cave off the riverbank and sleeping there.

    No heat, no hygiene, no amenities of any kind. Your Body might be perfect, but this will still take a toll. And you’ll still look absolutely awful after just the first few days - or at least your clothes will. Especially if you’re going to keep covering them in mud like this.

Maybe you could quit right away if you’re going to stay in a cave - the money you brought will carry you a lot further if you aren’t paying for a room - but you’ll still need food and some other supplies, and you’re not sure your Mind is up to the task of staying underground all alone for the next month. You’d go crazy, and that would seriously risk breaking your fragile Soul.

    Of course, you’re not doing much better here. There’s a dark strain from somewhere within. Not quite Body; not quite Mind. You need to be extremely careful with how much stress you put yourself through if you want to even survive the next month, let alone evade capture.

    Someone’s staring at you. Actually, a few people. There’s a group of boys maybe a little older than you who have been whispering and glancing in your direction for a few minutes now while you wait for the elevator with them and a few older miners who don’t seem to be paying attention. Uncomfortable, you try to shift slightly out of their sight by shuffling along the wall, but the tunnel’s too narrow for that to work very well. At least the elevator’s almost back now.

    It would be nice if you could hear what they’re whispering about. Almost certainly nothing good, you presume, but it would at least help if you knew they weren’t suspecting you of being an Angel. You are the only girl you’ve seen all day down here, so maybe you’re just unusual due to that. Another potential miscalculation; you really don’t want to stand out in any way.

    Elevator. Finally.

    <em>Scene 185</em>
    You get a little closer as the group rearranges in preparation for the elevator. They’re making crude comments about your appearance and presumed skills. You get a little farther away again, squeezing into the elevator to go back up. Great. This is good, you remind yourself. They’re treating you like a human girl, not an Angel. No one would <em>dare</em> speak like that about an Angel.

    At least, so you assume. The knowledge doesn’t improve your mood, regardless.

    Return above, clean up a little, and leave the mine. You hurry down cold, darkened streets, trying to focus on Soul to get advance warning if anyone is watching from above. No one, or at least no one you can detect. The river flows nearby and you make your way past a lower section of fencing to the bank. Need to find somewhere to hide. Somewhere close enough to not require a long walk, but hidden enough to not be obvious. Of course, it also can’t be hidden enough that <em>you</em> can’t find it, in the dark, in the cold, in a big hurry. Oh, this was such a bad idea.

    It takes you so much longer than you had thought, long enough to very nearly turn back and just find somewhere normal to sleep, flying Inquisitors or not. But you don’t give up, searching through the muck and stones until accidentally stumbling on a rock and dislodging it into a deeper crevice. Further investigation reveals a passable tunnel you can just about worm your way into, widening out into an appreciably-sized fissure that eventually descends a good distance before opening into a wide, relatively dry cavern.

Two narrow tunnels lead further into the unknown depths and you explore each a short distance before finding massive vertical drops too high to see the bottom even with your light. A pebble dropped into either takes several seconds before clattering onto loose stone below; a dizzying height. But at least nothing’s going to be climbing up from below to attack you while you sleep. Well, nothing more than the normal assortment of horrible bugs that you find just everywhere in caves like these. Thankfully they still seem to be wary of your glow and flee at your approach.

    With a groan, you finally sit down on a relatively smooth patch of stone and just do nothing for a minute. Let it sink in that this is your home for the next month or maybe more. That you’ll only be able to leave in order to take a brief journey back to the mine, after which you’ll head straight back down into a different cave.

    You’re safe here, probably, but you’re kidding yourself if you think you can make it a whole month at this rate.

    At least it’s warmer here than by the water. You’re soaked from the spray and covered in muck, but somehow the air feels almost warm here. There’s almost a draft... coming <em>from below.</em> Those strange vertical shafts are almost breathing, exhaling deep, warm air. You think about what could be lurking down there, and then decide you don’t want to think about it anymore. As long as it stays down here, you can just appreciate the warmth up here and that can be the end of it.

    “...”

Strip off your outer clothes and scrub off as much muck as you can in the water near the entrance before draping them over various shelves of rock to dry. Lay out a small blanket off the lower cave floor and roll up a portion for a thin pillow. Eat something... you forgot to get anything to eat, you were so wiped out from the mine.

    You... you’ll survive a single missed meal. It’s fine. You’ll just get some food in the morning, before going back to work. Water... you don’t know if you trust the river or the droplets on the cave walls. You’re <em>probably</em> immune to most diseases you could get from it, but you really don’t want to push your luck. Thankfully, you <em>did</em> remember to bring a small canister of water and can probably refill it tomorrow.

    Tired. Hungry. Still cold, despite the warmth from below. Cool air from above keeps sneaking in despite the outflow.

    You scratch a single line into one of the cave walls. <em>One.</em> One day survived. Only thirty-ish more.

    ... It has occurred to you that you could just not set up your clock, and simply not go back. You could just buy a bunch of supplies, bring them to this cave, and then hide out here for weeks. Without having to pay for a room, you could <em>probably</em> stretch your funds that far as long as you’re careful with spending. You wouldn’t have to go back into that spiky fissure and hunt for fluxpearls again.

    But you’d also then just be sitting here, all alone, doing nothing at all, for almost an entire month. You don’t know if you could handle that. At least at the mine, you’re <em>doing</em> things. You do get to talk to people, even if you don’t really like most of them from your brief interactions.

    <em>Scene 186</em>
    But after only a few moments, you wind up the clock and set the alarm properly, then collapse into “bed,” exhausted. You can’t just sit here for a month. You need <em>something</em> to do, even if it’s even more clambering around underground. At least you won’t be short of money this way, though gathering the courage to stay on the surface long enough to spend it won’t be trivial.

    You wonder how Jess and the others are doing. You may be out of reach (for now) but if the Inquisition figures out they’re helping you, they’ll be in serious danger.

    Well. There’s nothing you can do about it now except stay alive to make sure their risk was worth it.

    “...”

    Sleeping on the floor like this really sucks. It’s cold and uncomfortable and you can still see your glow even with your eyes closed. You’d turn it off, but then the bugs would come back and you hate that idea even more. A bit of thick cloth draped over your face helps with the light, but now you can’t turn onto your side or make other sudden moves. A drawn-out sigh. At least you have plenty of ideas for things to buy later.

    Eventually, you manage to drift off to a fitful sleep. The silver-eyed shade appears briefly in your dreams, as you knew it would, but it still gives you a fright. It’s just going to tell Jess you’re still alive, though. Nothing nefarious tonight.

    After that, you don’t dream of anything. You rarely do.

    ...

    A week goes by. You don’t see any Angels. Some basic amenities appear in the cave as you spend some of your pay. You improve at spotting fluxpearls, though the squeezes required to grab them don’t get any easier. Some of the boys are impressed by your agility. Most still comment on your appearance when they think you aren’t listening, and sometimes when they think you are. No one seems to think you’re an Angel; just a pretty athletic and pretty pretty human.

Unlike when Jess had been kidnapped and the whole city knew, no one is talking about half-Angels or executions or even the primes shifting around. You suppose it would be bad for the Cathedra’s reputation to admit that its own Angels break its own rules and aren’t as perfect as one might expect (though didn’t the new prime say the Inquisition would be more transparent?). But that’s good for you, as if these miners heard that a half-Angel matching your description was at large, you have no doubt they’d be able to figure it out. You just aren’t that good at disguising yourself.

    ... You’re worried about your dad. He expected this to happen, or something like it, so he probably has a plan to hide much like you do. He might even be <em>more</em> able to evade capture since his Soul (and appearance, actually) won’t stand out as much as yours. But if he does get captured, he’s facing execution. Just like you. And despite how much he put you through just by having you in the first place, you don’t want him to die. He tried to protect you, as best he could. Aside from that first sin that led to you being born in the first place, it wasn’t his fault.

    Your <em>mother</em>, however...

    Don’t think about that. You don’t need the extra stress right now. Later.

    So. That’s your life right now. Caves, overhearing uncomfortable statements, and the constant, gnawing fear of being discovered. All things considered, you’re doing just great.

    Another scratch on the cave wall. Only twenty-ish days to go.

    ...

    “Thank you, Angel Goodall. See you in another four hours.”

    “Happy to be here,” you grumble, not happy at all. As it turns out, “every four hours” really does mean “every four hours,” even in the middle of the night. It’s some horrible time in the extremely early morning, it’s super cold out, you’re very tired, and here you are in the Center after having to trudge across most of the campus in your pajamas and a coat.

    The Center is still busy even at this time of night. The corruption never sleeps, and so Angels don’t either. Or at least, those with the night shifts don’t. Well, they sleep during the day, but - get it together, Jessamine. The point is, it’s not unusual for there to be a number of Angels here talking with dispatchers or rushing out to the city. What <em>is</em> unusual is for there to be angry shouting going on somewhere on the other side of the room. All the people here are on the same side and usually work together without much issue. What’s the commotion about?

    You squint across the room, vaguely making out the back of a female Angel being very upset about something. It’s difficult to muster the energy to care; you just want to go back to sleep. But still, you’re curious.

    <em>Scene 187</em>
    “...”

    You hesitate by a desk for a few seconds before resignedly turning towards the shouting. You don’t have anything terribly important to do today anyway, and it <em>is</em> certainly helpful to know what’s going on. First off, who is it that’s doing the shouting?

    ... It’s Stella, you think. You aren’t very familiar with her, but she’s Yara’s captain and you’ve met her a few times. She’s usually very composed, so seeing her like this is unusual and concerning. You sneak a little closer, though it’s not like you’re not allowed to be here or particularly hiding from anyone; you just don’t want to be disruptive.

    “Fine!” she’s saying when you get close enough to hear. “Then you can cancel all my shifts, along with everyone under me, until you grow a damn spine and do the right thing!”

    The dispatcher she’s shouting at isn’t one of the rank-and-file either; the golden stripes on his coat indicate he’s one of the three shift managers and thus responsible for every Angel’s assignment for a full third of the day. “You know I can’t do that,” he replies, obviously trying very hard not to shout back. As a mortal man, it isn’t his place. “I’ll forward your concerns to Prime Athwood, but I don’t expect any change.”

    “To hell with Athwood.” There are a few mutters at her language, as there were just a sentence earlier, but no one dares correct her. “Why isn’t Barton in charge?”

    “Prime Barton has deferred to Prime Athwood’s authority due to the ongoing investigation surrounding the half-Angel.”

    “... Coward,” she mutters, but quickly picks up with more volume. “Fine. I’ll bring it up to the Emissary, then, if you’re going to let him get away with this.”

    “His holiness has also already deferred to Prime Athwood’s-”

    “Are you all insane?! Can no one here understand that your politics have literally killed-” Stella catches a glimpse of you standing back a bit and rapidly cuts herself off. “Jessamine! What <em>fortunate</em> timing you have.”

    “I’ve got to talk to you, just give me a minute.” She pivots back to the shift manager, stepping right up to his desk and bending down slightly to be on the same level. “One day. That’s all I’m giving you and your superiors to get your act together, then you’re facing an Angel mutiny. Tell Athwood; have him arrest my whole team; I do not care. You won’t have enough Angels to keep anything safe if you do that. I’ll be back this afternoon.”

    “I’ll pass along your concerns.”

    “Great. Better pass them quickly.” Then, to you: “Come on, Jessamine. Unless you needed one of these clowns?”

    “N-no.” You certainly don’t have to worry about being sleepy now.

    “Sorry if you’d rather be in bed,” she says as you step out into the early morning’s chill. “You have to do this even overnight?”

    “Er, yes. Every four hours.”

    “Unbelievable.” She shakes her head. Her hair is only half-up, you notice, with the rest hanging loosely as if she were interrupted midway through arranging it. “Right. First, I’m going to get a bit more yelling out of my system right now. Ready? Why didn’t you think to tell me that they sent Yara out to the wastes?! All they told me was ‘oh, he’s being reassigned,’ and the gossip the next few days made it clear it was a punishment and he’d been sent out to the wall, but by <em>God</em> I had never expected them to send him out of the city entirely! Jessamine, it’s been weeks; why didn’t you say anything?!”

But now that you think about it, she’s right. The rumors you heard all just ended with the two of them being sent <em>to</em> the wall, not <em>past</em> it, and you hadn’t thought to add anything further because the details were mostly the same anyway. “H-he’d have to fight wasteland beasts either way; I didn’t know the difference or that you would do anything-”

    “You don’t need to apologize to me. Sorry; it’s not your fault. I’m just so wound up after all that.”

    You’re starting to have some serious concerns about exactly why she’s so mad. Given what you overheard earlier... “Is... is he still alive? Are they both alive?”

    “Yes. But Etalyn got killed just yesterday. She’s wasted her second chance so early just due to pointless, idiotic posturing from the new prime.”

    “...” You can’t stop yourself from imagining how it might have happened. For some reason, your Mind fixates on the image of a towering shade punching a sharpened fist through her stomach, spilling blood and organs onto the packed, dead ground. Yara, desperately trying to drive it off before she returns to life only to be killed again... You try to shake it out of your head, but you just keep thinking about it. “Th-that’s why you were... Can you stop them?”

    A grimace. “I don’t know. Don’t tell Athwood, but my team hasn’t heard of this yet. Some of them will probably stand with me, but some probably won’t. I don’t know if it’ll be enough to actually make a difference, if he takes my bet and arrests me. But that’s about all I can bargain, if they really have gone all the way up to the Emissary with this. Maybe I should ask him myself, at least...”

But if you had just <em>said</em> something to Stella earlier, maybe...

    “How can I help?” you ask. “O-or did you just want to yell at me...?”

    “No; not just - agh, chin up. We’re going to get them out of the wastes and back here, no matter what Athwood wants to think. I don’t know about any of the half-Angel stuff and I don’t care right now. But I do need you to tell me at least the basic facts if I’m going to argue anything about what the three of you actually did. Then, we’re going to find as many Angels as possible who are willing to take a stand. Think you know anyone like that?”

    <em>Scene 188</em>
    You still have such a hard time trusting her. Obviously, she cares about Yara a great deal. She’s willing to look past the half-Angel... thing. She’s just trying to help... right?

    The cards. Why? <em>Why</em> do you continue to care so much about that fortune?

    “... Maybe,” you say uncertainly. And that’s the truth.

    It takes time to explain the gist of the situation to Stella, though you omit most of the details about Naoriel. It takes yet more time for her to explain, in turn, to the Angels under her command. Some of them support her. Some of them don’t. Some have questions for you. Others denounce you as a sinner, suggesting you’ve fallen. You don’t argue; you can’t be sure yourself. An Inquisitor waits nearby, monitoring. Some Angels notice; others don’t. You wonder how many more people might have supported you if he weren’t there. You wonder what he’s going to report to the prime.

    By the time the sun has risen and started to slowly thaw the night’s frost on grass and buildings, the Cathedra is humming with activity. Both the normal daily matters of defending Nucarreo from darkness, and the mutters of a growing showdown.

    Stella goes to meet with Prime Barton on her own, since she wants to confirm his stance on the matter before going to the Emissary himself. Barton is the prime of municipal incident management, meaning he’s responsible for all Angels dispatched into the city. He should be the one making decisions on where to assign Yara and Etalyn, as they’re both too new to be sent into the wastes, but as the shift manager noted, he agreed to defer to Prime Athwood, of Inquisition, in this case.

You spot an archbishop in his distinctive blue-gold coat speaking gravely to the shift manager from before. Someone gestures at you, but no one comes over to say anything. The archbishop is wearing an Inquisition badge. Your anxiety only climbs when he continues to not do anything and just lets you leave normally.

    Shortly afterwards, you sit on a bench for a while to calm down. You’re supposed to be recruiting more Angels to stand up against the prime and force him to bring Yara and Etalyn back, but you don’t know who you can trust. Clarity is a walking rumor mill and honestly surprisingly faithful - you wouldn’t be <em>too</em> surprised if she sides against you after all this. You haven’t talked to Serri in any depth in months, and you hardly know Jun. Erich... you... you already decided you couldn’t trust him. And you’re still not <em>sure</em> sure he didn’t report you to the Inquisition just before Naoriel left. You’ve been kind of avoiding him since then, and he hasn’t seemed keen to talk to you either.

    Beyond that... who else do you even know? Yara asked you to carry on his tradition of meeting the new Angels, but you hardly even remember their names. What about Denn? Rhysa? Emmett? You just don’t have in-depth relationships with many people - not enough to ask them to help you in something of this magnitude! At heart, you’re still that shy little girl staring longingly out the hospital window, aren’t you? Wouldn’t a <em>good</em> Angel have made more close friends?

    But if you don’t even try, you’ll be to blame if the whole thing fails. You can’t let the friends you <em>do</em> have down like that.

    But who can you even ask?!

    You go back and forth like that for a while. At some point, you almost decide that your best hope is for someone you know to randomly walk past and start the conversation themself. You could respond, you think, if someone else started it.

Obviously. Eventually, you get up and decide that you’re just going to have to suck it up and go find Serri (she’s probably the least intimidating of your options), but at this point Stella’s done with Prime Barton and stops by to tell you what happened.

    “He’s not going to help us,” she says bluntly. “Scared of the Inquisition after what happened to Prime Kin, and scared of what will happen if the half-Angel allegations are true and he didn’t cooperate.”

    “...” You don’t feel like you know enough about him to comment.

    “I didn’t really expect him to help anyway, but it was worth trying. Alright, I’m going to the Lordstone Cathedral. You coming, Jessamine?”

    “Er-” To be honest, you’re very scared of meeting the Emissary again at this point. You certainly haven’t been a model Angel recently, and that distant threat of vaporization still hasn’t entirely left your Mind. But if you can convince <em>him</em> to help...

    “Are you busy right now?”

    “... No.”

    “Right. Come on, then.”

    You’ve been to the Lordstone Cathedral a few times now, so you don’t feel quite as intimidated as before. You know the decor; you’ve met the Emissary. You’ve seen the Lordstone itself...

    <em>That’s</em> different.

    The Lordstone is a twenty-foot tall obelisk of deep blue crystal dotted with lighter twinkling specks that resemble the stars you can’t see through the mist. Or at least, it normally is. Today, for whatever reason, the crystal is still. The specks remain present, and a less-observant Angel than yourself might not even notice anything was different. But you can immediately tell the pattern is frozen. Motionless.

    Dead? - No! No; no, definitely not. You can still sense its brilliant glare of Soul; it’s just... paused. Temporarily stilled. Or... waiting? Preparing?

    <em>Scene 189</em>
    “Speak,” he says, looking down at you both. “I have already been informed why you are here.”

    She does, while you stand there awkwardly and try not to be noticed. Stella goes over the facts again, what you told her - you have to pay attention and say a few words at that point - and the danger that your friends are in while out in the wastes. How they could be killed. How they <em>have</em> been killed, at least once. How the Cathedra has no right to treat Angels like this - or even regular humans - for any reason. How a large group of Angels will not stand for it and will stop protecting the city tonight if Yara and Etalyn aren’t returned. How this request has nothing to do with absolving them of their punishment; all she wants is to make sure they aren’t killed.

    You comment here and there when she asks you to, but otherwise let her take the lead; she’s clearly done some preparation and is far more articulate than you could have been. In the meantime, you watch the Lordstone. Its stillness is bothering you in a very peculiar way and you’re feeling too paranoid to dismiss your instincts like that. You feel in danger, but you aren’t sure from what. You wish you could ask someone what’s wrong with the crystal, but you can’t interrupt the conversation like that even if you could trust anyone here to tell the truth.

    “I understand your concerns,” he says calmly, still without any sympathy in his expression. “But unfortunately, the punishment must be upheld as stated until the matter is resolved.”

    “Respectfully, why? Jessamine remains here, out of danger.”

    You feel a twinge of anxiety before he replies, like maybe the Emissary will just agree with her and send <em>you</em> to the wastes as well.

    He looks at you severely as he speaks. “Jessamine is not yet of age and cannot be held to the same standards, even for the same acts. She does not know the gravity of the situation.”

    “There is no law higher than that of the Lord, and His judgement is final. As His Emissary, I can only relay His wishes.”

    “God doesn’t want them to die. That can’t be true.”

    The Emissary sighs and adjusts position slightly. “I understand how this is difficult for you to accept. We must all undergo trials in our winding journey to serve the Lord as faithfully as we can. There certainly is every chance that the half-Angel will be located before any further harm can befall your friends. I can only pray that this is the case.”

    “... You’re really going to do this, then? You’re not going to change your Mind?”

    “I’m afraid not.”

    “So be it. Then I’ll see your Inquisitors tonight. We’re not backing down until they’ve been returned.”

    “So it will be.” He doesn’t try to talk her out of it, threaten her, or even seem that fazed by the idea that potentially dozens of Angels will refuse to respond to emergencies in the city. Perhaps he thinks the blame will lie entirely with Stella and the other Angels protesting, but surely he should still <em>care</em>, right?

    “Jessamine, any last-minute revelations that could turn everything around before we really go through with this? Anything you want to say to the Emissary?”

    Everyone looks at you. Oh, you hate that. All the attention makes it so hard to think. So hard to focus. So easy to slip up and - “If you’re doing what God wants, then why does the Lordstone look like that?!”

    You’re quickly ushered out. Somehow, you don’t entirely believe him. Especially when Stella asks “What did you see in the Lordstone? It didn’t look any different to me.”

    “R-really? It - er, the stars on it. They weren’t moving. It was a little subtle, but...” You assume Stella should have noticed it, if she were paying attention. She was looking right at it for several minutes.

    “No; I couldn’t tell. I must have been too focused on the Emissary.”

    “... I guess so...”

    <em>Scene 190</em>
    You find Serri in the upstairs common area, away from the bustle of the main floor one. The downstairs common area is more popular even on normal days, but today it’s additionally full of Angels discussing or arguing about the upcoming protest. You feel a little bad for dragging that up to her when she’s clearly trying to focus on something else, but not bad enough to stop.

    “Oh, hey, Jessamine,” she greets you. “Lots going on today, huh?”

    “... Yeah.” You hesitate, briefly observing her books and notes to determine she’s studying Body projection magic. Nothing unusual for her, except- “Do you have a few minutes to talk?”

    “Sure.” Serri finishes a sentence, then gently pushes her papers away a bit, making room. “Sit down; it feels like it’s been ages since we were together like this.”

    “Yeah, it has.” You’ve seen her relatively often lately, but never for long and always in a public context. Up here, it’s just the two of you. For now. “Er-” For some reason, it feels awkward to just get into what you actually want to ask, so you pivot to something you saw in her notes. “You’re learning healing now? Those books look pretty advanced.”

    “Surprised after all my talk about wanting to learn how to fight?”

    “Well... s-sort of?”

    “If you’re going to be a warrior, you’re going to get hurt, and the people around you will too. Angels who go to the wastelands have to be very good healers as well as very good fighters. I’m working on that part, too.”

    “That makes sense.” Another pause. Would it be even more awkward now? Oh, who cares? If that’s what you want to talk about, then just talk about it! “Er, speaking of the wastelands... a-and Yara and Etalyn...”

    She doesn’t say anything. But she’s no longer smiling.

I’m sorry for getting them involved,” you find yourself saying. What? That’s not what you meant to- “I know you’re friends with them too... I didn’t mean to get anyone else hurt; I just needed help...” Somehow, you feel tears prickling at the corners of your eyes, threatening to spill over. You’ve been holding it together for weeks now, but apparently just talking to Serri was enough to push it to the edge.

    “I don’t blame you.”

    “... You don’t?” Your voice is tight; you turn away to wipe your eyes, not wanting to start crying for real.

    “You did what you thought was right, right? To save Naoriel. And you did.”

    “H-hang on, I thought you didn’t like Naoriel?”

    A soft little smile. “I was <em>jealous</em> of Naoriel. For taking <em>you</em> away from me,” she adds, poking you on the arm. “But after all this, I know she needed you. You were trying to save her life. And so far, it looks like you’re succeeding.”

    “... You’re very mature for being only a few months older than me.”

    A soft little laugh. “Jun helped with that. But no, Jess, I don’t blame you for them being sent to the wastelands. That’s all on the prime who made that decision.” She gestures to the floor, presumably down to the lower common area. “I’m not living under a rock here; I’ve heard what you’ve been doing today.”

    “T-then, will you help with the protest? We need as many Angels as possible to really show him that we mean it.”

    “I don’t have a scheduled shift at the Center, though. I can’t exactly stop doing something I’m not doing already.”

    “You don’t need one! Just being there to show support is enough!” Something occurs to you. “And if you really want to strike, you can always stop doing your homework.”

I think you were being very reckless to help Naoriel escape like that, but I definitely don’t agree with how they’re treating the punishments. Plus, I really don’t want either of them to... die.”

    “W-wait, you don’t think we should have helped Naoriel? I thought, just a minute ago, you-”

    “I <em>understand</em> why you did it, and I think it’s a valid reason. But, no, I don’t think you should have done it. She’s dangerous, and the fact that she doesn’t seem dangerous - and she doesn’t want to hurt anyone herself - just makes it worse. I heard a little about what half-Angels can do - what they <em>always do</em>, even if they don’t want to - after it got publicized. Erejil. You can’t take that risk.”

    “Er-” You’re suffering a bit of emotional whiplash here, trying to reconcile Serri’s thoughts about you doing the wrong thing but for the right reasons... you think that’s what she thinks? And in your confusion, you accidentally say something that should very definitely probably stay secret. “What if we can cure her?”

    “No way. It’s been centuries; surely someone would have figured it out by now.” A pause. “Jessamine, are you telling me that you know how to cure her?”

    No - you shouldn’t - it’s only a few days until you can actually attempt the operation! You can’t jeopardize it by telling anyone anything! You have to lie, but... oh God, you’re so bad at lying. “Nnn - I -”

    <em>Scene 191</em>
    You reach out. Voices overlap in your Mind. You can’t hear anything. Vision tunnels to a single point. You have to you must you should you can’t you NEED TO-

    Something breaks.

    You stumble forward, losing your balance and falling ungracefully onto Serri. She barely catches you, surprised, and says something else. Urgently. You still can’t hear anything. Everything is spinning. You can’t breathe. The sin slowly drains from your Mind once more, lingering at the end as if to say that you can’t keep doing this. You can’t resist forever. You’re too weak.

    The next time this happens, you won’t be able to stop.

    “...”

    What was that? It’s too quiet to be sure.

    “... at me?”

    That’s Serri’s voice. Your heart is pounding so loud you can hardly think. You feel sick. “...” You try to say something, but can’t.

    “That’s right, just...”

    A lapse.

    You wake up with a coughing gasp and sit up too quickly, sending the room spinning and narrowly avoiding headbutting Serri as she leans over you. “Wha - how...” You pause a moment, trying to get your heart under control. “How long was I out?”

    “A - a minute? How are you feeling?”

    “...” You notice shallow, lightly bloody scratches on her arms. “What happened? Did - did I do that?”

    “You were trying to scratch your eyes,” she says shakily. “I had to stop you.”

    You put your hands to your face. A set of fresh scratches much like Serri’s wounds stings just below your eyelids. The flesh is tender. You can smell something metallic; there’s more blood leaking from your nose. “... Thanks. I’m... okay now, I think.”

    “Are you sure? I did my best to help, but... this was from your sickness, right?” She says it quietly, as if to not let it know she’s talking about it.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1303433561570807919 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1303433561570807919><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, November 5, 2024 1:59 PM">1:59 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“A-ah. Pr...obably.” Honestly, you don’t know. You don’t <em>think</em> so, since this “compulsion” started after you cut your strings. It probably only just <em>triggers</em> your sickness, since you’re obviously very stressed while it’s happening. But... you still don’t really know what your sickness is. Aveline doesn’t know. The Emissary doesn’t know. It’s something about your Soul, and it is possible that the changes to you from earlier this year have interacted with it to create something worse. It’s... not something you want to consider, really.

    “Is it getting worse?” she asks, still speaking quietly. “I thought you were getting treatment...”

    “I am! I still meet with Aveline every two weeks to work on it, and it’s been generally okay for a while.” This is legitimately true. You haven’t had much issue with your sickness under normal circumstances recently. But... “M-maybe I’ve just been really stressed lately. With... you know.”

    She nods, slowly. She knows. “I guess, if you think it’s under control... but, Jess, I’m really worried about you, if this is what it’s like. Are you sure there’s nothing else that can be done to help?”

    You aren’t sure. You could ask Aveline about it, or the Emissary, or someone else in authority. You could, but you won’t. Because you’re certain that - even if this isn’t entirely caused by your actions with the shade - it’s absolutely influenced by them. And something tells you that admitting you’re feeling compulsions to break other Angels’ ties to God would be a very quick way to get yourself arrested or even executed for having fallen. You can’t take that risk.

    “I’m sure,” you lie. Poorly, but you’re already so distressed that Serri won’t be able to tell. Probably. “I’m working on it. It’s under control.”

    “... Okay. But tell me, if there’s anything I can do to help.”

    “I will.” Another lie. You can’t tell her. Not until it’s all over.

    You’re such a sinful Angel.

Serri’s here, as is Jun (you said hi but didn’t talk in any detail), though she still seems concerned enough to keep an eye out in case you start dying again. You won’t. Hopefully.

    At the agreed-upon evening bell, Yara and Etalyn are still not here, so Stella and a number of other Angels simply stand or sit around the edges of the room and do not work. Other Angels come and go unhindered, receiving missions and departing for the city. A few, who either haven’t heard about this or who want more information, stop to talk. Some of those few join the protest. Others do not.

    Overall, there are at least two dozen full Angels standing here not doing their job (along with you and some of the other trainees). That doesn’t sound like a lot at first, until you remember that there are only ever about 120 Angels at any given time. Take away the Seraphs, Archangels, and trainees, and there are only maybe around 100 “regular” Angels. A full quarter of those are right here doing nothing.

    That’s a lot.

    The dispatchers get behind quite quickly. Calls go unanswered, with requests for Angels waiting in a queue and concise notices sent back informing the constables that there are not enough resources to respond. Angels who have just returned from a mission but aren’t injured or exhausted are turned around and sent right back out again, even though they would usually be allowed to rest. Required, even. No one wants an Angel to get hurt due to overwork. But in times like this, it seems the priority is on completing missions instead.

But it’s obvious why, when you think about it for a moment: as Angels themselves, they are in fact among those being sent on missions. They don’t have time to stand and watch you; they must make up for the shortage. However, that’s not to say you aren’t being watched at all. Monks take notes and the occasional bishop will speak briefly with a dispatcher or one of the protestors before moving on. Everything is fairly civil, but very tense. The Cathedra is running at a deficit for now, and everyone knows it can’t keep it up forever.

    Muttering breaks out on the other side of the room. You stand up and peek over there to see what’s the matter - oh!

    A brilliant, glowing Angel with skin of metallic gold strides into the Center. A Seraph, one of only three currently alive. Ordinarily, such paragons would be receiving orders directly from the Emissary - there’s no need to waste their talents on the normal missions that the Center deals with. But, today, this glorious Angel enters the building, speaks briefly with a few dispatchers and several of the protestors near the door on that side, and...

    Ah. You had thought he might have been here to join the protest - what a statement that would make! - but instead he picks up six entire missions from the board, all at once, and starts reading through the details. Even the best of the best are here to make up for the shortage of Angels. Which, presumably, means whatever more important business they would normally attend to is going unfulfilled.

    <em>Scene 192</em>
    What you hear when you ask one of the dispatchers those questions does not reassure you. Angels are being withdrawn from all positions and duties to fill demand at the Center. There are enough to make it up, barely, but everything else is more-or-less at a standstill. The two-Angel rule at the walls is temporarily rescinded and some districts end up with only a single Angel guarding their entire border with the wastes. Healers are recalled from the city center hospital and placed on mission duty instead. Higher ranking Angels who would ordinarily be planning, researching, or investigating are now here. Nothing else is getting done.

    And you just don’t understand why the primes would allow it.

    Even you can tell this situation is both not sustainable and extremely dangerous. One shade can often match even a strong Angel in power, and massive sections of the walls are defended only lightly. What happens if two shades attack at once? More? You don’t get any satisfactory answers and the shift manager on duty doesn’t seem to want to talk to you. The most you get is that the overall structure of the response isn’t decided here, which must mean someone higher up is doing the deciding. Prime Athwood is an obvious choice, but what would he gain from doing so? By risking so much?

Repeated attempts to talk with the primes are ignored. Archbishops offer incentives to get back to work. By and large, nobody does. The situation worsens as more Angels return from their missions too hurt or tired to go back out. They must rest, which leaves even more missions to go unaddressed; two of these hurt Angels actually side with the protestors, claiming unreasonable expectations that led to severe injuries. Some of the working Angels argue with the protestors, escalating in one case to actual physical blows. The sheer number of other nearby Angels are able to quickly put a stop to the fight, but both participants are removed from the scene unable to take any missions even if they wanted to.

    You wonder what the ordinary people of Nucarreo think about all this, as their divine guardians simply do not arrive to save them. Something has to break, very soon. The primes, the Angels, the walls, the city; <em>something</em> has to give. This can’t go on for much longer.

    Uneasy, you go to sleep on the third day of the protest wondering if something terrible will have happened by the time you wake up. But it seems like that question will have to wait, because you dream of a cave.

    “Jessamine!”

    Disoriented, you’re nearly knocked over by Naoriel as she rushes to hug you. “Woah, woah - what? You’re - it’s not time yet! Right?”

    The silver-eyed shade is here too, lurking near one of the tunnels leading out of this main room stocked with just enough furniture and provisions to feel slightly more homey than a hole in the ground. “It is ready,” it says distantly. “The cut-string puppets do not have long left.”

    “Jess, <em>what</em> is going on at the Cathedra? It’s a mess out here!”

    “Er, there’s a protest - s-sorry, what do you mean by a mess? How bad is it?”

Things like lost Souls, corruption-related sickness, healings, Blessings; anything that isn’t an actual darkness creature in the city is being ignored. There’s a lot of angry people around, and when Angels do show up, they’re mobbed with desperate requests. It’s only gotten really bad today, but there were some grumblings yesterday. What’s this protest about?”

    “Well-” You explain, briefly. As expected, Naoriel doesn’t take it well. Of course not; she didn’t even know what happened to the three of you after she left. You spend a little bit of time trying to explain the details in more depth, but are interrupted by the shade.

    “It cannot hide this spell indefinitely. The cut-string puppets must hurry their conversation.”

    “Hide? From who?”

    “Other shades,” Naoriel tells you quickly. You don’t have time to ask for clarification, apparently, though you really want to. “But it’s right, we need to talk about that later. Okay, can you get out of the Cathedra tomorrow?”

    “Er - m-maybe? That’s a day early, though?”

    “My Soul is stable enough to accept the procedure now, it says. It doesn’t have to be three months exactly and we’re really in a hurry - especially with the protest going on like you’re saying!”

    “Right,” you respond quickly. It does make sense: the sooner you can resolve the Naoriel situation, the sooner she can stop having to live in a cave (apparently; you’re impressed with her determination to hide underground like this), but also the sooner you can bring her back to the Cathedra, prove she isn’t a half-Angel (anymore), get Yara and Etalyn back home, and get all the protesting Angels back into the city to help people!

    It’s the perfect plan and you have total faith that every part of it will go smoothly with no complications whatsoever. Except the opposite of that, but you have to try anyway.

    “I already picked out the place. It’s close to the wall so the shade can get in more easily, close to me, and not far from a train station. I’ll give you the directions and a time if you’re committed, but if you need more time, I won’t. To be safe.”

    Somehow, her offering the directions makes it sink in. You’re really doing this. You’re going to leave the Cathedra without permission, <em>let a shade into the city on purpose</em>, then meet up with it and do a definitely super-blasphemous operation on a fellow Angel. Your mouth suddenly feels very dry. What if anything goes wrong? Will you even <em>survive</em> tomorrow?

    Well. Are you forgetting anything? Are you ready? Once you agree to hear the directions, there’s no turning back from your fate. Whatever it may be.

    <em>Scene 193</em>
    “I’m ready,” you decide. “Whatever happens, it’ll happen tomorrow.”

    “Okay.” She pauses, but not for long. “Okay. Tomorrow, here’s the route you’ll need...”

    ...

    You wake up in the middle of the night again to go to the Center and return to bed. You’re not ready yet, and you don’t want to perform your escape without enough sleep. Instead, it’s only the second time you wake up, just before morning bell, that it’s time to put your plan into action.

    It’s a very simple plan, as far as these things go. You gather up the supplies you’ll need (borrowed or requested from various storehouses over the last few weeks), go do your final check-in at the Center, make sure no one’s following you, and break into one of the smaller temple buildings near the outer wall. You don’t have to break into the building itself - it’s open to all - but you do have to use your enhanced strength and one of the tools you brought along to cut a small padlock off the door that leads to the roof.

    From here, you’re fairly close to the wall and, having scouted it ahead of time, know where in the city you’ll end up when you...

    Hm. You hesitate on the edge of the roof. It’s a long way down and you still aren’t good at healing magic.

    Don’t let nerves get the better of you; Naoriel needs you. Yara and Etalyn need you. In an abstract sense, Nucarreo needs you. So you had better get it together and jump off that roof. Just don’t miss the landing.

    “...”

    A few steps back. A running leap. A loud <em>ding</em> as you land heavily on top of the wall before scrambling off and dropping to the ground on the other side. Your ankles tingle with pain despite the magical reinforcement you had given your Body, protesting the demands placed upon them. But nothing’s broken and you’re out. Time to go, before anyone comes to check on that chime.

Same aspect but different spell, so it’s easier to do while on the move. You definitely don’t want to get recognized as an Angel today, not with all the unrest around. Unlike usual, you don’t go to the city’s central station to catch your train; there might be monks watching to see if anyone passes by. Instead, you head to a branch station nearby and buy a ticket on the local train to the tenth district. (You’d take the express, but it doesn’t stop here since you’re still fairly close to the central station where it does.)

    While you wait for it to arrive, you pace the platform anxiously, trying to keep track of everyone nearby and whether they’re watching you. It’s a hopeless task; even at this less-popular station, you’re still close enough to the city center for it to be packed. And you can’t use your Soul sense to any significant degree with your magic otherwise occupied maintaining your disguise, so anyone sneaking up on you would only have to evade your physical eyes. You feel blind.

    But despite that, the train arrives on time and you climb aboard without issue. Before long, you’re rattling off towards your destination. Every station stop feels endless; every stretch of track between takes an eternity. At one point, your train stops briefly on a siding to let the express pass, which just adds further insult. You could have transferred to <em>that</em> one, you think as you watch it disappear into the mist ahead, if you had just gotten off at the last station. Too late to be worth it now. And maybe it’s for the better; after all, who would expect you to take the slow option?

The air smells of smoke and sweat; a group of men filthy with dirt climb to the platform talking raucously about their shift in the mines. One of them seems to keep glancing your way, but you can’t be sure as they’re on the opposite side of the tracks and are generally facing this direction anyway.

    The train arrives. You depart. You arrive. You descend into the city once again.

    A sense of unreality grows as you follow the directions you wrote down earlier, winding deeper into a maze of narrow alleys stained with dirt and unknown liquids. It hasn’t really sunk in what you’re here to do. What you’re going to sacrifice by doing it. You’ve just been assuming - hoping - that the Cathedra will be fine with all your transgressions if it means curing Naoriel and solving the whole problem. But, what if they aren’t? What if you <em>can’t</em> save her? Are you going to have to go on the run? Live in a cave like she’s been doing? Be sent to the wastes? Or.

    An image of a guillotine forms in your Mind, as crystal clear as if it were directly in front of you. The dull chips and scratches in the blade, the worn-down grain of the wood, the subtle flex and scrape as metal presses against the frame. Stains from years of use, unable to be washed out.

    You stop for a moment, pressing a hand against the wall momentarily as if to remind yourself what’s real. The image dissolves. But just as quickly, another replaces it. Phil’s hands; that strange ring on his pinky. The cards and designs on their backs. The broken gear. The sun. The fallen Angel. The spy.

    “...”

    There’s nothing for it but to move forward. You take two more turns and knock quietly on a nondescript wooden door marked with a nondescript blotch of dull green paint. A pause. The door rattles; someone peeks out. “Jess?” she whispers. “What did I tell you last night?”

    “Come in.”

    Naoriel lets you in and closes the door. You feel sick.

    The room itself is located down a short hallway and is dull but fairly clean. Faded tiles and an old, broken door hanger thingy indicate this was once a doctor’s office. The clean sheets atop the table in the center of the room reinforce that perception.

    The shade does not.

    It stands in the corner by a countertop, rinsing a metal tool in the sink. You can see the wires from here, immediately remembering the orange-eyed shade’s procedures. You’ll be doing something very similar here.

    “The cut-string puppet has arrived,” it observes, turning slightly so you can see a silver eye. “It hopes she has brought sufficient conviction to see this through.”

    “I - I have. I’m ready. We’re going to fix it.”

    Naoriel swallows, controlling her breathing. She’s clearly terribly nervous, which makes you feel a little better, actually. You’re not crazy for being so scared. “Jess, how long has it been since you left? How long do we have before someone notices you’re gone?”

    “...” You count it up, trying to remember all the bells you heard throughout the day. You really should start carrying a clock. “Two... it’s been at least two hours. Maybe three? I - I took the local, which was slow, and-” You cut yourself off; it doesn’t matter. “We might have an hour? Plus however long it takes to actually do something when I don’t show up.”

    “The rite will take at least one hour,” the shade informs you. “Longer, if it and the cut-string puppet do not have effective harmony.”

    “Then we have to get started right away,” Naoriel declares, approaching the table and hopping up onto it. “B-before I lose my nerve. Jessamine, are you ready? Really, really ready to do this?”

    You can feel your hands trembling with your heartbeat, but your voice is stable. “Yes.”

Takes a deep breath. “Then do it. Give me the drink.”

    You give her the small vial of liquid, near-identical to the one you made when you entered her Mind a while back. The one that will put her to sleep and induce the right frame of Mind for the operation. You hope. You really, really hope, because you won’t get a second chance.

    “...” Naoriel hesitates, staring at the mixture. “Jess, if I don’t wake up or if this goes wrong in some way... please, don’t blame yourself. I want to do this. You’ve done nothing but help me this whole time. I know you’ll want to think it’s your fault if anything happens, but it won’t be. It’s... it’s enough that you’re even willing to try. Okay?”

    You have trouble answering. You’d like to tell her that it won’t go wrong, that she will wake up, and there’s nothing to be worried about. But you can’t. Not here. Not now. So, there’s only really one thing to say. “... Okay.”

    “Then, I’ll see you in an hour.”

    She drinks the liquid and lies down. Within seconds, she’s asleep. You look up at the shade, suddenly deathly afraid that it’s about to turn on you. It could corrupt two Angels, right now, for free, if it just-

    “It is ready. But before the beginning, it will ask the cut-string puppet her opinion. Sense its power, and sense her power. Feel the balance. It is attempting to keep its output similar to the cut-string puppet’s, to ensure balance. Is it correct?”

    You switch to Soul and observe. Light shines from your Soul and mixes with the dimming shadows flowing from the shade. With your current positions on either side of Naoriel, the contrasting energies mix directly above and inside her Body. “I - I can’t tell. It looks right...?”

    “It asks since there are consequences for incorrect balancing. Too much of hers risks destruction of the Soul. Too much of its risks transformation. Only an even mixture will remain unchanged. It believes the balance is stable, but if she does not, it will adjust.”

    <em>Scene 194</em>
    “It looks right,” you repeat. “Keep it as it is.”

    “As she wishes.” The shade offers you the cool metal rods, now familiar from several times doing this same procedure. “Let her begin.”

    A deep breath, held, then released. You can do this. You have to.

    You take the rods and begin.

    ...

    “It’s time to move,” the Inquisitor says as he strides imperiously into the room. You close your books and stand up immediately, having been ready for this for weeks now. “To the east.”

    “Right. Lead the way.”

    Your name is Erich Haskell, and you’re currently betraying Jessamine Goodall. You know that. You hate that. But you’re doing it anyway, because she just won’t listen. And someone needs to save her before she goes too far.

    “Where to the east?” you ask, running alongside the Inquisitor towards one of the Cathedra’s outer gates. “I can’t sense anything yet.”

    “Don’t know yet,” he says tersely. “That’s what we’re going to find out.”

    You have your own concerns about the Inquisition’s handling of the current situation, but you know it’s still the right choice to help them. Having worked with Jessamine and Yara on the new detection spell - and thus having practiced it more than any of the currently working Inquisitors - you are uniquely qualified to detect her Soul from a long distance, likely more than any other regular Angel.

The guards stay out of your way; they know who you are and what you’re doing. “Douse us,” she says as she touches both of you briefly. All of your appearances shift to become more human; less Angelic. A moment later, the first Inquisitor does as requested, smothering the light from your Souls under a blanket of muffling magic. You are now disguised or hidden in all three aspects, allowing you to detect others at a range longer than they can detect you. This sort of three-person operation is relatively common with the Inquisition, allowing them to bypass the limitations of one spell per Angel at a time. At least, as long as everyone stays together and is sufficiently talented to hold three targets at once.

    They are. And it doesn’t matter if you are or not, since your job is only to focus on Soul sensing. You aren’t as good as Jessamine, but you are good generally. And if she’s out in the city, she probably can’t be using the same spell back on you without breaking her disguise. There are likely other groups of Inquisitors out searching in the same way as yours, though hopefully with less success. You want your group to be the one to find her. Not for the promised rewards; rather, you don’t want her to get hurt and you don’t trust some of the other hot-headed Inquisitors to try to resolve matters peacefully first.

    That’s one of the reasons you’re helping them. The other-

    “Found her,” you say quietly. “Left; this way. Follow me.”

    You don’t have time to think about your reasoning as you strain to track Jessamine through a maze of buildings and lesser Souls. She’s not moving quickly, but is surrounded by a dense cluster of humans. A station? Then, her presence suddenly accelerates away and out of your range. Moments later, you arrive at a busy train station.

    “She must have been on whatever train just departed,” you reason.

The ticket agents are quickly persuaded to provide all the information you need, including the description of a girl with blonde hair buying a ticket on the local train to the tenth district. Within minutes, someone in the Cathedra has gotten in contact with someone in the railway and further stations along the same line have received new surveillance duties. At roughly the same time, a private locomotive arrives at the station and you’re off at a much faster pace than the train you’re racing.

    With your train shadowing the local and Jessamine’s presence now just barely within range again, you have some time to think about your second reason. But it’s not like you need long.

    You used to have a brother. Thanks to the corruption, you don’t anymore.

    You <em>know</em> what happens when the corruption enters a Soul. What it looks like day by agonizing day as the decay spreads and multiplies, despite several Angelic attempts to cure it. Every time, it just grew back stronger and faster. It simply could not be stopped. Once it has a foothold, it’s over. The best you can do is destroy the infected portion and try to save the rest. Trying to save the whole person is nothing but foolishness.

    And with a half-Angel, it’s foolishness that could cost many, many people more than just their brothers.

    You shake your head as the train slows, waiting for the train you’re tailing to finish a station stop. You tried to explain. She just didn’t listen. Bringing up any of this personal experience wouldn’t have helped; she would have found a way to say Naoriel is somehow different. She’s stubborn like that when it comes to what she thinks is right. Admirable, except when she’s just <em>wrong.</em>

You haven’t talked to her much at all in the last few weeks. Was that because you felt she wouldn’t listen, or just because you didn’t want to try again? Did that vague promise of “I’ll tell you by the end of the year” give you a convenient excuse to do nothing? Did you really think everything would still be okay by then? Were you just too angry?

    Thinking about Jessamine always makes you so confused.

    “...”

    At some point, one of the undercover constables claims to have seen her getting off her train and remaining at the station for a transfer. Your Soul sense agrees, so the three of you stop the private train on the tracks a moderate distance back - seeing that thing go by would definitely alert her - and simply leap onto a nearby roof. From there, it’s an easy descent to the ground and you can enter the station the normal way, disguised and hidden by the crowd.

    You don’t dare get close, but you catch sight of her once. Scanning the platform. Looking for you, probably. Thankfully, your disguises are sufficient and she doesn’t seem to notice.

    A train arrives. Jessamine boards. You do too. A few stations down the line, your Soul sense detects her departing, so you do too. The maze-like alleyways confuse you briefly, but the bigger problem is much, much darker.

    “I can’t track her any further,” you report. “There’s a... cloud over the area that’s hiding her Soul.”

    Now out of public view, the Inquisitor holding up your disguises is willing to drop that spell to switch to Soul. But it only takes her a second to grow much more alarmed.

    “Stop,” she hisses. “I sense a shade nearby.”

    “What?” you whisper back. “Jessamine knows better than-”

    “Goodall may have fallen entirely,” the Inquisitor hiding your Souls interrupts. “With a shade and two potentially corrupted Angels, we may need backup.”

    “This has to be some sort of misunderstanding; are you certain it’s a shade?”

That cloud can only be created by darkness with a Mind. If it isn’t a shade, then it’s Goodall with the power of one. Either way, it’s dangerous enough to be cautious.”

    “I’ll request an Archangel,” the first Inquisitor decides.

    “There won’t be any available!”

    “They’ll make an exception for this.”

    As the Inquisitors go back and forth about how best to prepare for battle, you feel something else. A shift in the cloud, somehow; a wavy pattern that manifests as motes of shimmering light to your spiritual eyes. “Look; it’s not all dark. What if she’s in there somewhere, in danger from the shade? We can’t just wait here for backup if that’s the case.”

    A pause. Surreally, you realize the Inquisitors are nervous. Maybe you should be too, but somehow the only anxiety you feel is that you’ll be too late.

    “Let’s search for the building, at least,” the female Inquisitor concedes. “The cloud is large enough it could still take quite a while.”

    “Fine. But if there’s actually a shade in there, hold back until we have the advantage.”

    Agreement. You begin to search.

    <em>Scene 195</em>
    ...

    You’re exhausted.

    Your hands hurt from gripping the rods, your eyes can hardly focus on the minute detail in front of you, and your Soul strains as you continue to force it out of your Body to perform the surgery.

    This has been going on for almost an hour. With the orange-eyed shade, you would have been unconscious already. It’s a staggering effort to stay not only awake, but also coherent enough to not screw up any of the delicate operations you have to carry out.

    The shade, inscrutable as always, stands just across from you, its darkness mixing with your light just above the table. It shows no signs of tiring, simply wielding its strange tools with precision as you charge them with your Soul. Not for the first time, you wonder how it learned to do this. There aren’t many opportunities to practice out in the wastes, are there?

    Naoriel sleeps uncomfortably as her Soul is reshaped. Unlike with the orange-eyed shade, no fragments of broken memories or burned identity litter the floor; every piece you disconnect is melded back into place elsewhere. But such drastic operations are rare; for the most part, you’re just rearranging and smoothing the strange, harsh curves of light that you still can’t quite understand the significance of. Modulating the intensity of illumination.

    It’s unbearably delicate work. You can imagine how easy it would be to slip up and carve a deep gash. Death would be so simple to produce with these tools that can touch Souls. Although perhaps it wouldn’t be as easy as you think; even your Soul is fraying a little as it scrapes against hers. An Angel’s Soul is tougher than a human’s, and Naoriel has at least half of one. You’re able to arrange it such that the lost portions are temporary - current emotions and the like rather than anything important - but it still produces a dreadful emptiness. You wouldn’t have had any idea how to do any of this without the shade.

Even now, you have no good answer.

    “Decrease your output,” the shade says tersely.

    “... Wha?” You’re so out of it, it takes a moment to parse its words. “A-ah... okay.”

    The light from your Soul dims. The centerpoint of the colliding waves shifts noticeably to your side; darkness laps over Naoriel’s form. “This... doesn’t look balanced.”

    “It is not. Outsiders interfere. Look.”

    It gestures to one of Naoriel’s hands. The tips of her fingers are slightly transparent, revealing ghostly flesh and bone followed by the sheets beneath. “Too much of hers, from those outside.”

    “Outside...?”

    “It is done,” the shade announces, disabling its tools. Your Soul snaps back to your Body with disorienting force, like you’ve suddenly regained several pints of blood. A headache blooms, briefly. You can think again.

    “Outside?! T-there are Angels here? Wait, are we <em>actually</em> done? Not just because of-”

    “It is done. All that remained was to polish away any introduced irregularities, but keeping the puppet’s Soul open in this environment would only introduce more faster than fixing is possible. It is done.”

    “She... she still looks normal... It’s going to be okay...” You’re so relieved you could cry. Aside from the slightly ghostly fingertips (which seem to be slowly returning to full opacity with your decreased output) she looks the same. No monochromatic colors, no strange mutations, and no blobs of darkness collecting on her Body. As soon as she wakes up, everything will be okay... “Wait, Angels?! Y-you didn’t answer; are they here?”

    “Yes. Increase your output. Once more. Correct. They are nearby, though hidden. Moving; it is difficult to hold the balance stable. The puppet must awaken before her Soul is sealed; she is very fragile currently. Strong changes in this environment may yet cause further irregularities.”

No luck; you can’t sense anything through the shade’s cloud. “She’s not - when can we wake her up?”

    “Impossible. The puppet must awaken on her own. Forced awakening will cause irreparable damage. It estimates many minutes, but not hours.”

    “We - we can’t - there’s no time, if they’re <em>here.</em> C-can you tell how strong they are? How many?”

    “No. His puppets are hidden. But they are close.”

    You struggle to come up with a solution. You can’t <em>fight</em> the Angels, but if they burst in here and see you and a shade looming over an unconscious Naoriel, they’ll probably fight you! In fact, you’re pretty much doomed if they even see the shade at all, but you’d bet almost anything they’ll already have figured out it’s here due to the weird concealing cloud over the area. Can you negotiate? Can you run? Hide? Will they just arrest you on sight? Kill you?

    There’s a knock on the door.

    Freeze. They wouldn’t do that if they wanted to kill you, right? Giving away their surprise like that? (Or is it a trap?)

    “Jessamine?” someone calls, muffled through the door and walls. “Are you in there?”

    “I-it’s Erich,” you realize. “Wh-what is <em>he</em> doing here?!”

    No one in the room has any answers for you.

    “Jessamine, I just want to talk. I admit there are several Inquisitors nearby, but no one will hurt you or Naoriel if you just come talk to me peacefully. I promise.”

    You have an idea. “C-can you keep Naoriel safe if I go out there? Until she wakes up?”

    “It can.”

    “H-how long will it take, again?”

    “Minutes, but not hours.”

    <em>“Can you be any more vague?”</em> You shake your head, hesitating at the threshold to the hallway. “Sorry. I - I’m going to go stall for time. Please, keep her balanced and safe until she wakes up, then... I don’t know; I’ll figure it out then!”

    “If you don’t answer, we’re going to have to break in. Please come to the door; I know you can hear me.” Erich’s voice flows through the beams of the building, carried by some magic to every room.

    “Okay. Okay.” You hate the idea of leaving her with the shade. But if it hasn’t betrayed you so far... and if she’s currently suffering from too much light instead of too much darkness... and if you can keep the Inquisitors at bay for “minutes”...

    <em>... God, if you still love me...</em> You hesitate, unsure if you should even continue with such a selfish prayer. But somehow - even now, amidst all your sin - you still believe you’re doing the right thing. That’s enough. That <em>has</em> to be enough. Because if it isn’t, what possibly could be?

    “This is your last chance,” Erich announces. “You have twenty seconds.”

    <em>... Please protect us.</em>

    God, as always, is silent.

    “...” One more deep breath, before everything comes to a head.

    You open the door. Just a little; just enough to make sure he’s actually there and it’s not just some recording. He really is. Standing a few paces back, ahead of a pair of Angels wearing blue Inquisition badges. Breaking into a relieved partial smile as you finally show your face.

    “Jessamine, I’m so glad you’re willing to listen to reason. Are you hurt?”

    You try to answer, but you can’t. You can’t speak. You can barely hear. You...

    The knowledge. The <em>sin.</em>

    <em>No,</em> you gasp, horrified at your own thoughts. At what’s about to happen. <em>No! No nononononono control yourself control yourself CONTROL-</em>

    CUT.

    HIS.

    STRINGS.

    <em>Scene 196</em>
    Some part of you tries to hold back, but it’s impossible. You’ve been resisting this impulse for months. Suppressing the urge to the point of physical injury. Now, you’re spent. There’s nothing left with which to resist.

    Distantly, you hear yourself saying something. See yourself slowly easing the door further open; carefully taking a single step outside. That’s enough. All you need. You reach out. And.

    Cut.

    His.

    Strings.

    You’re back in control as soon as you do. The sin falls from your Mind immediately, paralleling Erich as he falls to the ground. Wisps of broken... something linger in the Soul aspect for a moment before dissolving. You cover your mouth in shock.

    “I - I’m so sorry; I didn’t mean to-”

    But the Inquisitors were already moving before Erich even reached the ground. Now, an instant later and far too late to stop it, you catch sight of a blast of raw physical power. Dozens of metal rods like spears whip through the air diagonally, arcing from either side to avoid where Erich had been standing.

    The first one pierces your left arm, grazing bone before passing through and lodging itself between two ribs. The second cracks through your collarbone, embedding itself in your neck. The third-

    You fall to the ground, too, dozens of spears protruding from your Body and scraping against the pavement. You can’t even begin to describe what it feels like as your senses flee and your aspects fade into nothingness.

    You die.

    ...

    The sensation of a distant light presses from somewhere far above. Warmth. Compassion. Unbelievably powerful, though not overwhelming. No words are spoken, but somehow you know that it isn’t your time just yet.

    “!!!!!”

But you are bound and lying on the slick, mist-wet pavement. Bloody lengths of metal rattle nearby; your clothes are shredded and drenched in red. The evidence of your death is obvious.

    One of the Inquisitors from before stands directly overhead, holding an actual spear such that its point hovers just inches above your neck. “Stay absolutely quiet and still,” he instructs you threateningly. “A single move or spell and I will kill you again.”

    You try very hard. But you can’t stop yourself from crying.

    The Inquisitor doesn’t stab you for that, but he does keep a very close watch as other Angels move in and out of the mist. You hear shouting nearby. A burst of air rushes past, staggering everyone nearby and nearly sending you sliding down the street. Projectiles - magical and physical alike - streak into the sky, but only momentarily. Someone yells that it’s getting away. The shade, you can only assume. With Naoriel, you can only hope.

    Then, temporary silence. Erich is lifted up and rushed away. Minutes pass. The blade never leaves your throat. Finally, some sort of agreement is reached and someone presses something cold and sharp into one of your arms. You tremble, but otherwise don’t resist.

    ... You fall asleep.

    ... And wake up in the Lordstone Cathedral. Nothing feels real. This has to be some horrible dream; you must have passed out during Naoriel’s operation. Everything since then...

    The Emissary’s mouth is set into a hard line and his speech is clipped. Cold. Furious. “Jessamine Goodall. You have betrayed the Cathedra, the city of Nucarreo, and God Himself. You are deemed unfit to wield His power as His Angel, and are henceforth stripped of all such authority, rights, and responsibilities. May you never again harm another Soul.”

    He’s... is he-

    The Lordstone flashes. A deep, sharp <em>crack</em> echoes through the room. The ambient air pressure increases momentarily, and then it’s over.

    But it isn’t over. You feel the same. You can still see the light of everyone’s Souls. You can still see the frozen Lordstone. <em>You’re still an Angel.</em>

    And everyone knows it.

    “E-Emissary, what - what happened?” someone asks. Others repeat the question in different formats and overlapping voices. He tried to remove your powers; to undo your Ascension.

    And he failed.

    “ENOUGH!” the Emissary shouts, bringing immediate silence to the room. You shiver in the grasp of your captors, not daring to look at him as he searches your Soul with those piercing golden eyes. The next sentence is much quieter. Softer. But still holding the full authority of the closest man to God. “She is to be executed,” he says, almost beneath his breath. “This fallen Angel has stolen a portion of God’s Blessing. Only through her death may He be once again made whole.”

    The silence persists for several seconds more. You would object - scream or cry or say <em>something</em> - but you’re too stunned to react.

    “Such is my decree,” the Emissary continues. “Prepare the proper methods. Secure her until it can be done. And get this traitor out of my sight.”

    “No,” you manage to whisper as you’re hauled out of the room, unheard through the gag. “This isn’t fair.”

    Fair or not, no one can hear you.

    ...

    They lock you in a small cell in some basement. Everything’s metal and everything glows in the Soul aspect, enhanced with some magic to be more resistant to whatever you might do to try and escape. Two full Angels stand guard outside, though at a distance to avoid any presumed danger from whatever they think you did to Erich.

    “...”

    You don’t feel any compulsion to cut their strings. You can’t even see them. You don’t know how. The sin slumbers in the back of your Mind somewhere, invisible but still lurking.

It still doesn’t seem real. Nothing does. Somehow, you’re still convinced you’ll wake up on the floor at any moment with the shade standing over you.

    The shade. Naoriel. They must have gotten away. Good.

    “...”

    How did it turn out like this? You never meant to do anything sinful, or evil, or even just plain mean. You just wanted to save Naoriel. And somehow, that simple, obviously good desire will cost you your life. Both of them.

    “...”

    You shudder as you remember the awful pain from all the spears, and the sudden cessation immediately afterwards. They haven’t even given you any new clothes; you’re getting blood on the floor and furniture.

    “...”

    God saved you. You still received your second chance, despite your sins. You’re still an Angel, despite the Emissary’s attempt to take it all away. The Lordstone did not reverse your Ascension. God did not. Doesn’t that mean He still loves you?

    “...”

    Or is the Emissary right? Have you stolen your powers from God, by cutting your strings? Can He no longer stop you? Does that mean you really deserve to die?

    “...” You curl up in the corner, knees to your chest and head buried in your arms. Tears leak from your eyes, mixing with dried blood.

    You know this isn’t a dream. Rationally, of course you do. But you just can’t process what happened. It’s too extreme. What’s about to happen is too extreme.

    “D-dear God...” you breathe, saying it aloud to give some focus to your whirling thoughts. “Please... tell me.”

    A moment’s pause. The unfinished prayer hangs in the air.

    “Did I do the right thing?”

    The words slide away from you, arcing up towards the Lord high above. Of course, there’s no response. You didn’t expect one. You squeeze your eyes as tightly shut as you can, pressing out all the tears and - and-

    Oh, what’s the point?

    <em>Scene 197</em>
    “...ear me? Je...”

    A rushing, whirling noise fills your ears, like wind whipping past. Hesitantly, you open your eyes, but you aren’t anywhere in particular. It’s just dark and cold, with a faint undertone of some metallic scent that reminds you uncomfortably of blood.

    “...most reach y...”

    There’s a voice drifting on the wind, but it’s snatched away before you can understand what it’s saying or tell who it might be. Curious, you drift around a little bit, trying to find a spot that’s out of the wind that you can’t feel. This not-place reminds you of the grey emptiness you found yourself in when inexpertly navigating Naoriel’s Mind an eternity ago. But the not-wind is confusing. Plus, whose Mind could you possibly be inside here?

    “...ference. I can’t...”

    It’s maddening. Not only can you not understand the actual words, but even the fragments you do manage to catch are somehow stripped of meaning. And the not-wind just won’t stop! Where is it even coming from? You can’t feel any breeze!

    “...ve up for now, but...”

    The voice stops talking. After a while, the wind quiets down too, leaving you alone in the chill darkness. The tang of some sort of blood still hangs faintly in the not-air. It’s... discomforting, you decide. Not terrifying or anything, but just enough to make you feel on edge. Where is it coming from? It’s not you, right?

    ... No, because you’re not wearing your clothes. Instead, you’re in a white tunic near-identical to the one you wore years ago on the day of your Calling. Of your Ascension. Perfect, pure white, the better to display your own purity. Although that turned out to be a lie, it seems.

    “...” The scent of blood is only getting stronger. You need to find the source.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1307840375196618763 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1307840375196618763><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, November 17, 2024 5:50 PM">5:50 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>So off you go from nowhere to nowhere, drifting between points of nothing within a plane of nothing. At times, the not-wind picks up again, but now that you’re aware of your Body again, it properly whips at your hair and clothes like it’s supposed to. Unfortunately, the direction is too confused and malleable to give any hints; it could be coming from any direction. Sometimes, it’s even multiple at once.

    But the scent of blood gets stronger as you drift further in a certain direction. Eventually, something becomes visible. Stains and streaks of dark, deep red painting walls; floors; a ceiling out of empty nothingness.

    “...” You touch the floor gently, no longer able to fly now that you have some sort of physical structure for reference. It’s cool, but not cold. Smooth, but not slippery. Just textured enough to feel perfectly textureless. A generic non-material created from nothing in particular. It makes you uncomfortable, but the blood is still worse.

    As you proceed into this strange, giant corridor, the blood gets more prevalent. More and more of it is splashed on every available surface. Soon, you can’t avoid the puddles anymore and have to squelch your way through. You try to go slowly to avoid splashes, but before long it’s deeper than your sandals. The lower hem of your tunic grows sodden with scarlet. Disturbingly warm liquid flows around your feet. The smell is overpowering now; you have to pull up a portion of fabric to cover your nose.

    ... What manner of creature could possibly have spilled so much blood? It couldn’t be a single entity; this must have been the lifeforce of thousands or more. Now, it’s just scattered across this mystery tunnel in the middle of nowhere.

    Finally, you reach the end. The tunnel curves gently up a flight of stairs, from which pours a waterfall of rich, dark blood. Bracing yourself against the torrent, you climb.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1307840448513052673 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1307840448513052673><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, November 17, 2024 5:51 PM">5:51 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Red soaks your clothes. Douses your hair. Coats your skin. It’s impossible to avoid. You have to stay low and use your hands for grip as well if you don’t want to be swept back down by the unending flow. You try to keep your mouth closed as best you can, but you still taste it anyway. Tears well in your eyes; not from despair or pain, but to cleanse even more blood that’s collecting in them despite your squinting.

    You’re here.

    The stairs lead into an enormous circular room, so wide it could fit Nucarreo inside it with space to spare. The ceiling rises impossibly high, disappearing into the gloom far above. And the ultimate source of the blood spills from a distant sphere hanging from three chains connected to the walls by equidistant anchors each the size of a city block.

    It’s an unending crimson waterfall. The center of the cylindrical room thunders with blood churned to foam by its long fall. Hundreds of stairwells much like this one accept gentle flows out into their own tunnels. It’s all you can do to just stand here and take it in as the endless river tugs at your calves.

    “What-”

    You gasp awake in your cell, breathing quickly and shivering with paradoxical warmth - like a fever. The cold metal floor and wall you fell asleep on quickly leech the heat away, but the memory of it stays. You’re still covered in blood, but it’s dried and your own instead of fresh and that of some unbelievably enormous sphere.

    What... did that mean? What was that tunnel? The sphere? All that blood? Was it <em>just</em> a dream, or did it mean something terribly important?

    ...

    Hours later, someone brings you some food. They don’t talk to you or answer any questions. Without anything else to do, you eat it. It doesn’t make you feel any better.

    Hours later, someone else arrives at the window. You expect it to be another tray of bland nothing in particular, but that expectation is shattered when the someone says your name.

    You scramble to your feet with a swishing of bedding. “Y-Yara?!”

    He winks. “The one and only.”

    “B-but, you were - how - did they let you... how are you here?!”

    “Athwood had us released as soon as you were captured. I imagine he thinks we aren’t needed as bait anymore now that he has you.”

    “Wh - bait for what? And... is Etalyn... okay?”

    “Naoriel, I’m afraid. And, well, mostly.” He gestures to the side and shifts over a little; you can make out Etalyn looking perfectly composed just a few paces to the side.

    “He’s gonna pay for this,” she says by way of greeting. “‘Specially if he thinks he’s gonna get away with this ‘execution.’”

    Someone fake-coughs out of your view. She turns and raises an arm, presumably presenting the cougher with a rude gesture. “What’s he gonna do, send me <em>back</em> to the walls? Go ahead, go tell ‘im we’re both still mad. What a surprise that’ll be to hear.”

    “Er, yes, this visit is being monitored, in case you hadn’t guessed,” Yara explains. “The guards don’t seem to be too fond of us, for some reason I simply cannot guess.” A pause; he glances past Etalyn. “There’s... also someone else here to see you.”

    “...”

    It’s Erich. He looks much the same as always through the bars; perhaps a little more tired and a little less well-groomed, but mostly the same. His expression, however, is as serious as you’ve ever seen it.

    “... S-sorry-”

    He cuts you off. “Why, Jessamine? Tell me what exactly you did, and tell me why exactly you did it. Only then might I even consider listening to you.”

    <em>Scene 198</em>
    A breath. You’re aware of the guard presumably listening in on your conversation just down the hall. You probably shouldn’t say anything that could make the situation even worse. But...

    Honestly, how much worse can it get? Plus, Erich deserves to know.

    “I cut your strings,” you say. “But I don’t know what that means, exactly.”

    “Then you had better explain it inexactly.”

    “Well...” You hesitate, not really sure how best to arrange your thoughts and guesses. “F-first, I just want you to know that I did the same thing to myself, too. Months ago now; during my practical. I still don’t know much about strings or anything, but... it’s not going to kill you, or drain your powers, or corrupt you, or anything like that. At least... I’m pretty sure.”

    He doesn’t say anything. You get it; you haven’t finished explaining yet.

    “Did... you know that shades-” Another hesitation. Yara’s warning from back then drifts into your Mind. You shouldn’t reveal you can talk to them... but really, at this point, does it even matter? Another breath. “I can talk to shades. Y-you probably can now, too. Back during my practical, I had this dream about a factory...”

    You don’t tell him everything. You try to avoid the fact that shades call you puppets of God, and how that metaphor might imply something very scary about your connection to Him. But you explain the tube, some of the shade’s conversations, and what you had to do in the cistern. Some of this isn’t new - your time in the cistern and the operations you performed - but some of it you’ve never shared with anyone. You just... if you’re going to die tomorrow (today? What day is it? When will it happen?) - or even if you aren’t - you just... need him to understand.

    “So,” he says after you’ve talked for longer than you probably should have. “Why, then? And how, if you know.”

I...” One more hesitation. You <em>really</em> shouldn’t reveal this, if you want any hope of the Emissary changing his Mind. But, after the failed revocation of your powers... you don’t think he will anyway. And, again. You need Erich to understand. You could say the shade made you do it, or that you just blacked out and had no idea what you were doing. But the truth is that you <em>did</em> know. You had felt that sensation before. You knew it was getting harder to resist. You could have told somebody, but you didn’t. It’s not entirely your fault, but you <em>aren’t</em> blameless for this happening to him. You can’t carry the guilt of lying about it, even if you could get away with it.

    “Sometimes, ever since I removed that tube from my back, I’ve... gotten this compulsion. It... happens more with people I know well, I think, but.” A pause; you try to meet his eyes. It’s too hard; you look away. “I can see their strings, in the Soul aspect. Little strands of light, just above their heads. Like the tube I told you about, but thinner. It’s...”

    Breathe. The sin stirs in the back of your Mind. Your vision changes. You’ve slipped into Soul without even thinking about it. Erich doesn’t have strings anymore, but Yara does. Etalyn does. You’re sure the unknown guard Angel down the hall would, if you could see that far. “It’s like this <em>knowledge</em> that just shows up in my Mind. I just <em>know</em> how to do it. I <em>know</em> I need to do it.

    “... Until yesterday, I could hold back. As long as I fought it, it would go away on its own. But yesterday... I just couldn’t stop it. I’m... sorry. I don’t even know what I did, but...”

    A pause as you gather your thoughts. No one interrupts you. “I’ll help you fix it. However I can, I’ll make it right somehow. I don’t know if I can put the strings back or if that’s even a good idea, but I’ll make it up to you. Somehow...”

    No one’s saying anything. Steeling yourself, you raise your head to look into the corridor.

You can’t see his face, but his voice is quiet. “I’ll hold you to that,” he murmurs. “However long it takes.” Then, in a louder voice. “Jessamine, I have decided that you are foolish, stubborn, and occasionally paranoid. But you are not corrupt. You have a lot to make up for, so I fully expect you to live long enough to do so. Is that clear?”

    “... I don’t think I get to make that decision,” you admit.

    “You don’t have to.” He nods to Yara, then to Etalyn. “Best of luck, you two.” Then, another nod to the guard, but no more words. He walks purposefully down the corridor and out of view.

    You’re not sure what just happened or what convinced him, but you feel like that conversation could have gone a lot worse.

    “So... should I interpret that as a threat, or...” the guard asks from a distance. Etalyn tells him to shut up and he chuckles (nervously?) before falling silent again.

    The two of them stay only a little longer, but they do their best to reassure you before they go. The Angel strike ended yesterday when Yara and Etalyn were returned from the wall, but Stella and a number of those who participated still oppose the execution. There are a number of challenges to the decision making their way through the Cathedra’s layers of bureaucracy. Events can’t proceed for weeks at least, even with the fastest legal route. And you still have friends trying to help you out.

    It does help. A little.

    ...

    That night, you dream about wind again. More fragments of distant voices, but you can tell even less than last time. Blood stains your skin and clothes, manifesting from nowhere in particular. You can’t find your way back into the tunnel with the enormous sphere, nor are you sure you want to. It’s another restless night.

    The hope you felt yesterday completely evaporates. Your heart rate triples.

    Anyone in the city could immediately recognize the garb of an executioner.

    <em>Your</em> executioner.

    “It’s time,” the silver-trimmed Angel says. “May the Lord watch over you.”

    <em>Scene 199</em>
    For a few moments, you’re paralyzed by fear. But those moments pass quickly. “W-w-what?! Now? It’s - you have to go through the whole process! It’s too early!”

    “It was a unanimous decision,” one of the Angels says flatly as they bind your wrists. “Challenges can be overruled quickly with no objection.”

    “What?!” you repeat as you’re bundled into the hallway and forced into a march. “Unanimous? Of what group? What about a trial? What about process? What about the law?!”

    “There’s no higher law than God.”

    “But God doesn’t want me to die!”

    “Tell Him that when you meet Him.”

    This goes on for a little longer, but you honestly don’t know much about the law surrounding executions - just what Yara claimed yesterday. And it seems you can scream and struggle all you want, but all it’s going to do is annoy your captors and encourage them to add more restraints.

    You’re keenly aware of your heartbeat. Far too fast, it <em>demands</em> that you find some way to escape.

    You can’t.

    The Cathedra grounds are eerily empty. Mist swallows any sound you care to make. The sun glares at you overhead, a dull, pale blur high above. Like God’s eye, watching over you as the silver-clad Angel said.

    Half-formed ideas race through your Mind. You could cast a spell. Incapacitate the guards, like you did at the garage above the cistern. Sure, you could hardly handle three regular humans, but three Angels... nevermind. You could try saying - saying what?! Just run - where?! HOW?!

    A platform has been constructed in the circular plaza near the Cathedra’s center, between the actual Center and the Lordstone Cathedral. It looms from the mist, bearing the implement that will take your life. You’ve seen it in your dreams. Your imagination. Now, in reality.

It’s worn. Chipped and stained, but well maintained even after years of disuse. The last time an Angel was executed was...

    It doesn’t matter. The next time is today.

    Seeing the blade drains your energy. You feel almost hypnotized by the tiniest details, your struggles reduced to a state of docile near-paralysis. You wonder what it will feel like, as the sheet of metal cleaves through your neck.

    The murmurs of a crowd grow louder as you’re dragged closer, and you snap somewhat out of your trance. Monks, priests, bishops, and even regular staff are present, somberly waiting to witness the execution of one who should have been their hero. But you hardly even take note of the ordinary humans, because dozens of Angels are present too.

    Most wear stoic expressions, hiding whatever emotions they may feel. Some say a short prayer as you approach. Others, more of a curse. Desperately, you scan the crowd for anyone you know, not sure if their presence would make you feel better or worse.

    ... Oh... worse...

    Serri can’t bear to look at you; she’s one of the few willing to openly show her tears. Jun, by her side, grips her hand to steady her... or himself.

    Clarity says nothing. Her normally vibrant demeanor is still. Silent. Even her attire - always with a splash of color despite the Cathedra’s regulations - is perfectly monochrome. All white. She’s pure. Why aren’t you?

    Sims, grim but almost... satisfied to see such a corrupted Angel be brought down.

    Denn manages to catch your eyes and says something quietly before making the sign of the matan. A prayer. A blessing.

    Erich... is right at the front. Just before the podium. He slowly, gently shakes his head. No speech. No blessing. Not even the grace to look sad. So much for his words yesterday.

    The guard yesterday. “Should I interpret that as a threat?” he had asked. Did he? Have they locked your friends away again to prevent any possible interference?

    You’re brought onto the platform. Forced to your knees. This can’t be real.

    Smooth, aged wood locks around your neck. Prime Athwood stands beside the device. He’s saying something to the assembled crowd, but you can barely hear him over your heartbeat and the sound of blood rushing through your Body. Something about justice and how he hates having to do this and all the words words words.

    This cannot be real.

    The black-clad Angel steps to the other side of the machine. Rests their hand on the lever that will end your life.

    No.

    The silver and gold-clad Angels kneel before you, their backs to the crowd. Two of them, to avoid any mishearings or dishonesty. The gold-clad one speaks, this time. “Do you have any final words you wish to pass on?”

    You’re so far removed from the world that it’s difficult to interpret the question. But when you do, everything finally makes sense.

    This is real.

    “... I-” you begin, barely audible even to yourself. “D-do...”

    “Speak, then.”

    <em>Scene 200</em>
    “I never wanted to hurt anyone... I was only trying to help.”

    A shaky breath. You have so much more you want to say, but your thoughts are all jumbled up and you just can’t-

    Is that shouting?

    The gold-clad Angel looks up, concerned.

    Is that...? What’s going on?!

    ...

    Run. Run; hurry! You increase your speed again at the pang of anxiety, even though you’re already flying through the city streets like a pack of corruption beasts is chasing you. It isn’t, but some civilians jump out of your way like it might be. Others avoid you as if you <em>are</em> the pack of beasts. You’re going too fast for your cloak to hide your Body properly, but you try to adjust it with one hand anyway.

    You will not be too late. You <em>will not.</em>

    Two nights ago, you tried to reach Jessamine in her dreams. You couldn’t; the shade said there was some form of interference. So you switched targets.

    “My, oh my,” Yara had said when you made the connection. “Ms Fisher, you are certainly looking... different.”

    “I know,” you replied, already exhausted from trying with Jess but beyond relieved you managed to get through to <em>someone.</em> “It’s only cosmetic. I think.”

    “Well, I can tell you have urgent business with me, considering you invaded my dream, so I won’t ask much more. What can I do for you?”

    Even with your (correctly deduced) urgent business, you have to spare a moment to marvel. “You’re always so nonchalant. I just brought a shade into your dream, looking like <em>this</em>, and you don’t seem to Mind at all?”

    “Certainly I Mind, and were we face-to-face I would have a wide assortment of questions! But given your previous explanation, I feel I already have a reasonable idea what you’re here to talk about. Would you like to know what happened to our dear friend Jessamine?”

    “Yes. She’s... is she still alive?”

    “Certainly. But...”

You and Yara swapped info and agreed to plan further the next night, then it was over.

    You spent the next day in that same cave again, though this time with a guest. The shade stayed with you, unwilling to risk leaving the city with the Cathedra on such high alert. Besides, you had to plan with it as well. There was no way you were going to leave Jess to her fate.

    And it’s not like you could have stayed aboveground anyway. Not with your Body looking like it does now.

    Another corner. The Cathedra’s towers are visible through the mist. You’re almost there. Speed up one more time. You can make it. You will make it.

    The night after that - last night - Yara came bearing bad news.

    “Evening, Ms Fisher; dear shade. I come bearing problematic news.”

    “What is it?”

    “A reliable source I happen to have in the Inquisition has informed me that they intend to move Jessamine’s execution forward. Tomorrow morning, it seems. There’s been a lot of maneuvering among the primes to - it doesn’t matter. We need to be ready to move immediately. So, here’s our idea-”

    “S-sorry; a reliable source? N-now? Are you sure?”

    A brief wink, even then. “Our dear Mr Haskell would never let us down.”

    “H - What?! A-after what he...”

    “I’m afraid there will be time to discuss that later. For now, please hear out the plan we came up with here...”

    The gate is in sight. You’re here. Just minutes to go before everything comes to a head.

    “Hey!” you shout to the gate guards, flapping your cloak open so they can have no doubt of your identity. “Let me in!”

You expected nothing less. But, conveniently, a pair of Angels wearing the signature blue badges of the Inquisition just so happen to have been walking nearby. The two come to the gate, investigating all the shouting, and helpfully take custody of the dangerous fallen Angel that the ordinary humans at the gate wouldn’t be able to handle.

    You’d be terrified, if you didn’t happen to know who these “Inquisitors” would be ahead of time.

    “J-just checking,” you whisper as they march you away. “It... is you two, right?”

    The taller one winks. “The two and only. But we’ve really got to pick up the pace. Ets, can you help me carry her like we practiced?”

    A nod from the other one. You’re lifted up and the two “Inquisitors” break into a run. “This had better work,” Etalyn mutters, her tone unmistakable despite her disguise. “You don’t want to know how long it took him to convince me to help.”

    “Ah, it was an enjoyable three hou - HOLD IT! NOW!”

    Quite a lot of things happen quite quickly.

    The three of you rush towards a platform near the Cathedra’s central square; even from here, you can see the guillotine and a certain Angel locked within it. Members of the large crowd between you and the platform begin to turn towards the commotion. A group of Angels led by Stella hurry from the side of the Center building, nearby, and arrange themselves around your group. Yara drops his disguise and switches targets with urgency. It’s not visibly obvious what he’s doing, but you know from the plan that he’s holding the guillotine’s blade in place from a distance so even if someone throws the lever, it can’t fall. Etalyn positions herself beside you, one hand on her sheathed blade.

    Several <em>real</em> Inquisitors emerge from the crowd to face the Angels surrounding you, hands on their own blades. Prime Athwood and the three executioners, on the platform, look over at you. Everything slows down.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1309935443051286630 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1309935443051286630><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, November 23, 2024 12:35 PM">12:35 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Okay, you’re up,” Etalyn says calmly, nodding towards the crowd while keeping a careful watch on the nearest Inquisitors. “I sure hope you’re ready for this.”

    “Me - me too.”

    You take a step forward, letting your cloak fall fully off your shoulders. Revealing how you’ve changed. Murmurs; mutters. Discomfort; fear. What have you become, they wonder.

    You’d like to know that too.

    “My name is Naoriel Fisher,” you say, your voice echoing across the nearly-silent square and enhanced in volume by a nearby Angel’s magic. Another part arranged ahead of time; everyone can hear you. “I am the child of Lewis Kin, former prime of Inquisition, and... and Archangel Maeve Kamiya. I am a half-Angel.”

    “What are you doing?” you hear someone half-shouting from the platform. “Kill her! Both of them!” It’s Athwood, but neither the executioners nor the group of Inquisitors move. The former because the ceremony is not yet complete, and the latter because of Stella’s group holding them back. They could draw their blades and force the matter, but that would surely lead to bloodshed. Inquisitors aren’t Mindless automata beholden to carry out orders. They are Angels too. And Angels should not fight other Angels unless there is no other option.

    You have time. You made it in time. Now, you just have to be convincing.

    A deep breath.

    <em>Scene 201</em>
    ...

    “I am a half-Angel.”

    You can hardly believe your senses as Athwood shouts something nearby. Naoriel is <em>here?</em> And - and she’s-

    Facing the crowd and seemingly looking right at you still locked in the guillotine, Naoriel continues to speak. “I am not a danger to anyone here. Look at me. Past my Body, which has been changed by the rite that purified my Soul. I am not going to explode or fall to the corruption. I have not fallen. Look at me and understand.”

    Without much ability to do anything else, you take her advice along with (hopefully) the rest of the Angels present. You look.

    Physically, her appearance is quite a shock to anyone who hadn’t seen the results of your attempt to save Mila earlier this year. Her Body is drained of color; entirely greyscale but otherwise identical to her former appearance. You’re a little too far away to properly see her eyes, but even from here you can tell they’re almost entirely black. Were you closer, you’d bet you would be able to see images of distant stars slowly drifting through them. Like what you’ve been told is above the mist.

    This, you’ve seen before. You’re dismayed that the operation apparently hadn’t been as smooth as you thought - or something happened afterwards - but you were at least sort of prepared. No, the part that catches even you off-guard are the... stripes?

    Arcing across her Body in strange, twisting patterns are two curves that vary in width between two to four fingers wide. One is dark, like the fuzzy shadow that a shade’s Body is made of, while the other is bright; a soft white glow that basically looks like if a shade were made of light instead of darkness. The full extent of the curves is unknown due to her clothing, but together they cover maybe a fifth of her visible skin.

    “What happened...?” you murmur, but she did ask to look <em>past</em> her Body. So you do. Switching your vision to Soul takes several seconds, but when you do...
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1310657882030739559 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1310657882030739559><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, November 25, 2024 12:26 PM">12:26 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She’s stable. Different, but stable. You can’t sense any strong corruption (that can’t be explained by being near the shade) or any of the fracturing instability that had previously worried you so much. The quality of her inner light is subtly different somehow, but it’s not dark. It’s not cold. She still feels like an Angel; just one with a very unusual appearance. If they just give her a chance, this could work.

    “Angel Jessamine Goodall did this. She saved me. She learned how to <em>cure</em> half-Angels. You should be congratulating her and learning how she did it, not trying to <em>kill</em> her.”

    “You worked with a shade to bring this about,” Prime Athwood shouts from the platform, just to your right. “Any work these creatures perform is unholy and dangerous. This folly must be extinguished before you trick anyone else!”

    “It’s true,” she says. “We worked with a shade. But if you can just get Jessamine out of danger and be reasonable about this, we can explain how and why. Just because the corruption was involved doesn’t mean the outcome is corrupt as well. Please, just release her and we can talk.”

    “Absolutely not! This fallen Angel has committed crimes and will meet justice because of them. Your matter will be handled separately when your own corrupt deception is revealed.”

    One of the Angels next to her - wait, that’s Yara! - whispers something and Naoriel reluctantly nods. “If you insist, I can explain in brief right now. But when that’s over, release her to hear the rest. There’s too much to shout across this standoff.”

    “... By all means, continue.”

    Athwood waves up a messenger as Naoriel starts to explain the shade’s involvement in all this, sending him urgently away with a brief message. But it’s not long afterwards that a second messenger rushes up from a different direction, out of breath and panicked. And even as she’s racing up the platform stairs heedless of everything going on, the Cathedra’s bells begin to toll.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1310657946329284659 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1310657946329284659><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, November 25, 2024 12:26 PM">12:26 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>It’s a pattern you haven’t heard before, but one that you’ve definitely memorized. The messenger confirms it an instant later.

    “A f-full attack on the wall in the tenth district,” she reports breathlessly. “At least twenty shades. At least two hundred Mindless creatures. Already at least one breach; requesting immediate Seraph and Archangel support.”

    A pause.

    Then an explosive burst of movement. Athwood pivots away from you immediately, shouting orders as he runs towards the Center. The one Seraph within earshot spreads his wings and takes flight, angling towards the wall. A handful of winged Archangels follow suit. The remaining regular Angels begin forming into groups based on ability, captains yelling for their squads and breaking off for the train station. Naoriel is almost forgotten in the mess, swept up in the crowd along with Yara, Etalyn, and most of Stella’s group.

    As for you... “I don’t need to walk you back to your cell, do I?” the executioner asks as they unlock the guillotine and - blessedly - pull you free of imminent death. “I will be needed at the wall.”

    “N-no; you don’t need to,” you reply. “I - I’ll stay here?”

    “Good enough. Prove your half-Angel friend right, would you? I’d rather not have to do this again.”

    Then they’re off. The silver and gold Angels follow soon after, presumably also powerful fighters needed to repel the assault. Off-balance, confused, and more than a little frightened, you crouch down next to the guillotine as if worried someone is going to spot you and decide you should probably be locked up. Then you have a slightly better idea and hop down off the platform to not be so obvious.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1310658014071754843 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1310658014071754843><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, November 25, 2024 12:27 PM">12:27 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>W-what should you do? Everyone’s running around with their predefined role in this chaos, but you don’t have one. None of the trainees should - except possibly Erich, since he’s apparently involved with the Inquisition? Actually, that though finally sparks something resembling a plan and you push into the crowd looking for Serri. Erich is probably gone by now, and you saw Naoriel running off with Yara’s group so she’s probably not here either. But Serri was close to the front and shouldn’t have left yet... if you can find her. How are there still so many people here? Shouldn’t everyone have scattered by now? Where are all these ordinary humans coming from?

    ... More to the point, this is bad. <em>Really</em> bad. On top of the already-obvious consequences of such a massive attack on the wall at all, the timing <em>cannot</em> be a coincidence. And Athwood at least will try to blame you or Naoriel for it; you’re sure of that. He might be right, honestly. How much do you <em>really</em> trust the silver-eyed shade? Was Erich leading the Inquisitors to you the foretold betrayal or do you still have more to endure? Is it somehow using the unrest in the Cathedra - <em>caused by you</em> - to break into the city?

    Finally, the flood of people slows and you’re able to see around the square again. Just about everyone has left; there are no Angels remaining besides you. Where did everyone go? Where did your <em>friends</em> go - wouldn’t they have wanted to come help you? Did you miss some obvious signal that told everyone where to meet? Is the entire Cathedra going to the walls to fight? Surely not; even twenty shades...

    You pause to think about it. That’s a lot of shades. That’s more than you honestly thought even existed. You’re used to thinking of them as one or two - “the silver-eyed shade” or “the orange-eyed shade” - not a whole group. Together... what would they be capable of? How many Angels will die to stop them?

    “...”

You briefly imagine still being stuck in the guillotine, now in a mostly-deserted square, at the mercy of any random person who walked by and maybe wanted to pull the lever.

    Enough thinking. Time to <em>do</em> something.

    <em>Scene 202</em>
    The Center. That’s where everyone will be. Or, if not, <em>someone</em> will be there who can tell you how to help. Decision made, you rush off in that direction. Outside the gates, you can hear locomotives quickly departing the Cathedra station, presumably on their way to the outer walls carrying more reinforcing Angels (without wings of their own). Maybe that’s where you’ll go, if the dispatchers think that’s best. But, honestly, you’re worried they’re going to tell you to just stay here and do nothing. Or send you back to jail. And then when everyone comes back, nothing will have changed with your situation except that they’ll trust you even <em>less</em> after such a tragedy. You need to have the opportunity to help! To prove that you really aren’t a monster!

    There are still people in the Center, thankfully. Not many Angels - and those who remain are primarily trainees or younger ones who graduated recently - but plenty of human staff coordinating the response. You look around for anyone you know, but are spotted by someone with a clipboard before you can find anyone.

    “Goodall!” the clipboard person exclaims, dramatically ticking something (you, presumably) off their list. “Where have you been?”

    “Er - just outside? It - it’s only been a minute; in all the chaos, I didn’t-”

    “Nevermind that! Do you currently have a duty assigned?”

    “No-”

    “Are you willing and able to destroy corruption creatures?”

    “Yes?”

    “Desk C, over there. You’re going out to the city and I don’t give two hoots what that Athwood fellow thinks about it! Go! Hurry!”

    Forcibly shooed in that direction before you can respond, you hustle over to the indicated desk. Slightly buoyed by the unknown clerk’s faith in you, but similarly terrified by the scale of the disaster. They’re sending <em>you</em> out? A trainee? A potentially fallen Angel? Someone who was seconds away from being executed and who should probably still be in jail right now?

If you question it, someone might decide you’re right.

    It’s a short line; there are only two Angels ahead of you. Still no one you know, though you crane your neck and look around. There aren’t many Angels left at all, actually. Is <em>everyone</em> being sent to either the walls or the city?

    A minute or so later, it’s your turn. The frazzled dispatcher does a double take when she notices who you are, but decides not to question it either. “Trainee, huh? But you’re certainly no ordinary trainee... How about... seventh district perimeter, right by-”

    You suddenly flinch, your Body briefly convulsing with a powerful shiver. The Center falls silent; everyone else felt it too. Someone starts to voice a question: “What was-”

    The sudden wrenching sound of heavy wood splintering apart doesn’t answer that question, but the huge, armor-plated corruption beast leaping into the room and crashing through a desk (and the dispatcher sitting at it) does.

    Chaos.

    More beasts plow through the large room’s multitude of doorways. The few Angels remaining begin to fight, channeling magic or bringing weapons to bear. Ordinary humans scramble to run, but there’s nowhere <em>to</em> run - the beasts are everywhere. A heavy beast charges right at you; you react on instinct and throw yourself aside to dodge the trampling hooves. An instant later, the screaming starts.

    You turn, switching aspects as you start to get a grip on the situation. Thrust your hands at the creature and burn it badly enough to get its attention. Distract it from the dispatcher you had just been speaking to and lead it away as you sprint to <em>anywhere</em> else. Don’t look back. You can’t tell how bad their injuries are. You just know that fighting this many beasts by yourself is hopeless; you need to team up with the rest of the Angels in this room.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1311350362204147733 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1311350362204147733><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, November 27, 2024 10:18 AM">10:18 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“How?! Where did they come from?!” someone shouts as you finally reach the group, finding a brief window of safety now that someone else can cover your back. You don’t have a weapon, obviously, so you stand slightly behind those who do and aim to burn the creatures away with just your Soul. It’s so cold; even just being near them is enough to hurt. But you can’t give up just from that.

    “Figure it out later! Just kill them for now!” someone else yells back. A reasonable response, except this is <em>the Cathedra</em>. The center of the city; the most well-defended place in Nucarreo. How <em>in the world</em> did Mindless darkness get all the way here? It must have come from the wastelands, but how did it get all the way through the city without anyone noticing? Or... those pools of tar; “spawning pools,” the conjecture was. Did that ever get resolved? Oh, God, you can’t remember and this is just distracting you! Maybe that second person is right after all.

    Your little group of five Angels does a reasonable job holding off the darkness creatures. None of you get badly hurt, no one’s too tired yet, and you’re managing to make your way across the room to encircle ordinary staff within an expanding ring of protection. Several beasts have already been slain by the others’ weapons or reduced to ash by your powers. Treacherously, you almost start to believe you’ll manage to pull it off.

    And in fact, you do. After what feels like forever but was only a few minutes in reality, the last of the beasts dissolves into ash, then smoke. The room is destroyed, but clear. None of the Angels in your group are seriously hurt, though most have lesser wounds from teeth or claws. There’s a pause; the second Angel to speak raises his voice. “Is everyone okay? If you’re hurt, please call out so we can help you.”

You’re about to head in that direction when there’s another, more severe chill. You spin, choking out some sort of warning, but there’s nothing you can say that will help. “Shade! Th-that way!”

    Angels scramble to reposition as you’re proven immediately and horribly correct.

    The shadow-like creature stalks through one of the broken doors and you’re immediately struck by how tall it is compared to the other shades you’ve seen. Are they actually shadows of specific people? Stop it! Focus! This is almost certainly the first shade anyone besides you has seen in-person, since no one in your group is very experienced. The oldest Angel here only graduated three years ago. Even with five of you, you’re almost certainly outmatched.

    <em>Please be the silver one please be the silver one please-</em>

    It turns towards you, snapping its legs together smartly. Its eyes are deep, dark blue. “Hello, little puppets,” it rasps. “Bad luck.”

    A long, thin blade materializes from darkness - identical to its Body, except less fuzzy; more reflective - in each hand and it walks quickly forward. “It is in quite a hurry today. No time to play...”

    <em>Scene 203</em>
    “S-stop!” you exclaim, stepping forward to stand between the shade and the rest of your group. “If you’re in a hurry, then stopping to fight is only going to slow you down more. You don’t need to...” It’s a weak argument - what if its purpose is simply to kill? - but it’s the best you could come up with in the handful of seconds you had.

    “You can <em>understand</em> that thing?” someone asks incredulously.

    “Weren’t you listening before?” someone else answers. “She was working with a shade! Is this your shade, Jessamine? Is it... friendly?”

    No and probably not, in that order, but you don’t dare to answer that right now.

    The shade in question pauses. “Interesting. You must be the one it has heard so much about. It doubts the success of the other’s plan, but it supposes it may gain by allowing the attempt. This one may live.” It gestures behind it with one blade, through the broken-open door. “Exit.”

    You swallow, already anticipating the response you’ll get. “It... says we can leave.”

    “What about the wounded here? What is it doing here at all? What’s it going to do if we just leave it alone?”

    Yeah. That. You look at the shade helplessly; it can understand the questions as well as you can.

    “It has laid the terms. This one, and only this one, may exit. Or all may perish. It cares little for which.”

    Ah. You misunderstood. “It, um, it says th-that...” <em>That what? That only I, specifically, can leave, and everyone else has to die? There has to be some other way!</em>

    The shade resumes its walk. “Slow, slow. It is in a hurry.”

    “We won’t get in your way; I promise! Just-”

    “This one will be quiet or suffer the same fate.”

    You can’t think of anything. It’s right; you’re just too slow. At least if you say it, maybe the others can do something with that information. “It says only I can leave and no one else! I’m - I’m sorry!”

    The fight is short. But brutal.

It’s so fast, and it can disappear and reappear elsewhere near-instantly. You only take in the violence in short, snapshot-like bursts. A fountain of blood as two legs are sheared off in a single blow. Effortlessly, the dark blade passing through flesh and bone with only a hint of resistance. The chime of a starmetal blade blocking the shade’s, once, before the creature teleports and removes the offending sword arm at the elbow. Overlapping blasts of magic, confused, dispersing in multiple directions. Too slow to track their target. Light in the room becomes dim; it blends into the created shadows. Can appear from anywhere. It’s nothing but a pair of eyes and an unending, guttural cackle.

    You try to help, but it’s just so fast it seems impossible; you risk hitting someone else with every potential blast. And even just standing this close while attuned to Soul saps your strength with the constant, debilitating chill. You try to at least brighten up the room to dispel the shadows, but somehow you just can’t gather enough composure to even create a light.

    It can’t have been more than half a minute by the time you stumble back towards the doorway it had indicated previously. Fresh blood dots your clothing. All four other Angels lie on the ground, very, very dead. The shade languidly turns to face you. Somehow, there’s blood adhering to its semi-corporeal form too. It has no mouth, but one of the splatters paints the suggestion of a deranged smile. At least, so it appears to you.

    “Run along now, little puppet,” the shade rasps almost liltingly, before returning to a harsher tone. “Or die.”

    You can already see the beginning of a second chance’s glow on the ground. Flesh reattaching; regrowing; refilling with blood and life. You should stay; help - you could maybe-
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1312105516691886091 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1312105516691886091><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, November 29, 2024 12:18 PM">12:18 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The shade swings one of its blades, so fast you can hardly see it. Your left shoulder erupts in pain; blood trickles towards your elbow. Panicked, you backpedal while looking down to see a cleanly circular slice of missing flesh, right at the edge. You can barely make out a sliver of bone beneath the blood. And, as if to garnish the wound, a perfectly-cut segment of your hair flutters towards the ground. In a single strike.

    “It will not miss again.”

    You run.

    There’s nothing you could have done. You have to believe that.

    “...”

    Things are hardly better outside. The grounds are overrun by Mindless darkness, Angels fighting against the beasts, and panicked humans running in all directions. Nowhere is safe. You don’t know where to go; what to do. Your left arm hardly works - the joint refuses to move properly - and blood continues to flow, coating your hand in scarlet. You don’t know enough of the right sort of magic to do much but dull the pain and start to accelerate your Body’s natural healing, but something about the wound rejects your magic. Corruption. You burn it away, hiding in a small garden area to tend the wound, and manage to stanch most of the bleeding. You won’t die, but that’s about it.

    The question “how?” keeps spiraling around your Mind. How could this possibly have happened? How did all this corruption get here? How are the shades - you have to assume more than one - here? How did no one sense anything wrong? How did they know so many Angels would be at the wall? How is there so much darkness that they can attack like this in two places at once?

    You’re working yourself up into a panic by thinking about all that. You need to focus on what you can do here and now. Destroy the darkness. Save people. That’s what you can do, right? That’s what you’re <em>meant</em> to do.

You realize what building you’re hiding beside. This is the Lordstone Cathedral, and you’re in that garden where you sat - an eternity ago - to calm down before meeting the Emissary for the first time.

    The Emissary. The Lordstone. G-God (literally?) - what if...?

    You hurry to the main doors, noting to your alarm that the heavy wood is badly scratched and has definitely been forced open. There’s a gap wide enough for you to just slip inside. The entrance chamber is empty of allies and enemies alike, but it’s not empty of evidence of battle. Furniture has been destroyed. Blood has been spilled. Ash drifts in the wake of your passage: the remnants of burned-away darkness creatures.

    The inner doors are closed, but also badly damaged. You can’t hear anything from inside. Are you too late? You have to find out... right?

    You cautiously open the door just a little and peek inside. Relief, to an extent. You aren’t too late; the Emissary is there along with his two guards. But ash drifts in this inner chamber too; Mindless darkness made it all the way to the stairs leading to the Lordstone itself. One of the Angels is badly hurt, with a bloody gash all the way down his torso. The other is injured too, and is trying to stabilize the first. The Emissary watches from just behind his chair, one hand on the Lordstone as he mouths silent words.

    You hesitate at the doorway.

    <em>Scene 204</em>
    “E-excuse me,” you call hesitantly, slipping into the inner room and pressing the door closed behind you. “How can I help? I can’t heal, but maybe I can-” Two gazes focus on you; the remaining Angel is unconscious. You try to look unthreatening.

    “Have you come to finish the job?” the Emissary asks, interrupting you. “You won’t have come alone. Where is that shade?”

    “N-no; I don’t know. Like I keep telling you, I’m <em>not</em> a traitor. I’m really not working with them. I don’t know what’s going on either and - l-look! You present your wounded arm. “They attacked me too. I only got away because...” A pause. Why <em>did</em> the shade let you live, really? Because you’re important to the “other’s plan,” which you assume means the silver-eyed shade. But what is its plan? You certainly don’t know, aside from something about... cutting... strings.

    Oh.

    Now that you’re thinking about it, the sin bubbles just below your consciousness again. You can see the strings. Both of the nearby Angels have them, of course, but... the Lordstone... It’s a pillar of golden light; the largest string (or bundle of strings?) you’ve ever seen extends up through the cathedral’s roof. Thousands of smaller strings branch out from the sides, fading to transparency after a dozen feet and waving gently in the mostly-still air. They bend around the Emissary as he stands nearby, curling tight to his Body.

    <em>Oh.</em> You understand now.

    “Because of what?” he counters. “Because it freed you to come here and destroy everything?”

P-probably,” you admit. “But I didn’t know about it until just now! When... I can see the strings! The Lordstone; it has this giant pillar of light that goes up and it’s-” You cut yourself off, aware you aren’t making sense. “I’m not here to hurt anyone or do anything bad. I think I know what’s going on now and what the shades want. And I’m not going to help them.”

    “Really?” rasps a familiar voice. You urgently turn around to watch the doors creak open. “That’s too bad.”

    It’s the silver-eyed shade. And - “Naoriel?! Are you okay; where have you been? What are you doing with it?”

    She looks dazed. Her markings pulse with light and shadow; there’s blood trickling from a gash on her temple. “I’m... okay,” she answers. “It protected me.”

    “Yes,” the shade continues, slowly proceeding forward alongside Naoriel’s small, unstable steps. “This unfortunate puppet is a target of both sides now. It was required to unmake several aggressors.”

    The Angel who had been healing the unconscious one this whole time finally finishes (to an extent) - his comrade groans but does not awaken. Stable, but not of any help in this standoff. He stands, picking up his starmetal weapon and glancing back at the Emissary. “Orders, your holiness?”

    The Emissary sighs. “You won’t be able to stand against them in your state, Nicholas. Hold, for now.” Then, addressing the shade: “What do you want, demon? Why have you brought your two fallen traitors to this room?”

    “L-like I said-” you try to interrupt, but no one’s paying attention to you.

    “It desires a very simple concept: freedom for all of His puppets. It will end this servitude.”

    “By doing what?”

    “Severing the Puppetmaster’s strings.” It nods briefly, almost like a short bow. “It holds no desire to harm His puppets. If they will step aside from His Body for just a moment, it will not need to harm anyone present.”

    The Emissary is looking at you, Naoriel, and the shade with his unnervingly perceptive golden eyes. “I understand now,” he breathes. “You changed the rules with the half-Angel, and you needed Goodall for her Soul sensitivity. You... truly do wish to destroy everything.”

    “It will merely make a change.”

    “You’ll engulf the entire planet.”

    “Enough. It is aware that stronger puppets will be returning. Time is brief. Will these ones move aside?”

    “Of course not,” the Emissary declares. “I will not allow such devastation to come. Not while I still draw breath.” He shifts to look at you. “Jessamine, if you truly mean what you have been claiming this whole time - if you truly remain one of His loyal servants - then fight alongside Nicholas to destroy the shade.”

    The shade looks at you. It doesn’t seem concerned. “It would prefer her cooperation, but it may understand if she does not. The change will be significant.”

    Naoriel speaks softly by the shade’s side. “Jessamine... I know it seems scary, but this is the right thing to do. The shade doesn’t want to hurt anyone. It just wants us - <em>all</em> of us - to be free.”

    <em>Scene 205</em>
    You have to fight someone. You have to pick a side. Either support the Emissary and the Cathedra - and help destroy the shade, kill Naoriel, and presumably preserve the city’s fragile and imperfect status quo - or help usher in a new, uncertain era by destroying the Lordstone. You don’t know for sure that’s what “cutting its strings” will do, but... come on.

    Bad, bad. You don’t want to hurt anyone. You don’t want to kill anyone. You don’t have enough information to know what will be the best option, or if there’s some third path to take.

    Excuses.

    No, they’re not excuses. You’re important, somehow. The Emissary thinks the shade needs you for your Soul sensitivity. The other shade thinks you’re needed for the silver-eyed one’s plan. Your opinions, therefore, must carry weight. Surely, there has to be some way that doesn’t involve bloodshed.

    There isn’t.

    You silence that quietly doubting voice in your head and declare it. “I’m not going to fight anyone. I’m not going to help anyone kill anyone else. If you want me to help <em>either</em> of you, I need-”

    What do you need? Knowledge? You wouldn’t understand it. A promise? You couldn’t trust it. Peace?

    ... You could never broker it.

    You point at the shade. “-to know exactly what your ‘change’ will be.” You point at the Emissary. “I need a promise that you’ll stop trying to execute me and Naoriel.” You step back a few paces, to the side, so you can look at both of them at once. “AND from <em>both</em> of you, I need you to just stop fighting and <em>talk.”</em>

    Greedy. Idealistic. And so very naive. But you’re fed up with everything. You’re sick of the violence. The death. The shade has strong reasons for what it’s doing - you’re sure of it. But the Cathedra does too. Everyone just wants what’s best and if you could all just-

    “There is no time.” The shade looks up, sensing. “Others approach. Step aside or be-”

    “Nicholas, do what you can.”

The shade attacks. You backpedal out of harm’s way, unable to keep up with the lightning-quick array of slashes, thrusts, and blasts. Even injured, Nicholas is one of the most skilled Angels you’ve seen. His starmetal weapon, unusually, is a glaive instead of a sword, but that just extends his reach and allows him to block with the entire length of the shaft - it’s all starmetal, not just wood. But the silver-eyed shade - along with teleporting just as the blue-eyed shade could - also has a unique weapon. Its blades aren’t straight; they flex and extend, swinging around like whips or ribbons. It’s almost balletic, until one of them carves a long channel out of the solid stone floor. Smoke rises from fused rock and burnt mortar.

    While the two strongest combatants are distracting each other, Naoriel runs for the Lordstone.

    The Emissary notices immediately and crouches to retrieve the wounded Angel’s starmetal weapon, holding it inexpertly but with deadly resolve. You have to do <em>something</em> - you run around the side of the main fight, not sure who you’re going to support or if you’re going to try to be neutral again but you just can’t let Naoriel and the Emissary try to kill each other! At least you feel a lot more confident about your ability to meaningfully influence a fight like this than... yeah.

    She’s picked up a weapon at some point as well. You know she didn’t have one when she left, and there’s really only one place she could have gotten one on such short notice. Another Angel. The shade did say - “Naoriel, stop!”

    She glances over as you approach, but keeps most of her focus on the Emissary. Just an old man gripping a sword he doesn’t have the training to use, but still determined to defend the Lordstone to his last breath. “We have to do this,” she murmurs. “It’s the only way to be free.”

They wrap around the Emissary, as before, and a few even drift close to you with a soft warm glow. But none come near Naoriel, all repelled by some force you can’t see even while attuned to Soul. “You don’t have to fight him for it; h-he’s-”

    “She does,” he growls. “I will not stand down.”

    “No! That’s not what I meant-!!” A pause; a horrible doubt. “N-Naoriel... are you... yourself right now?”

    She looks at you, briefly. “Of course I am. I told you to look past my Body, Jess.”

    But. Her condition; she looks so much like Mila. Corrupted, obviously, to the point where the Lordstone is rejecting her. But different to your Soul senses; you still can only sense warmth. Still, would Naoriel really do this? Hold a blade against the Emissary and the Cathedra as a whole, in order to “free” the puppets? What does that even mean?

    The fallen Angel. Betrayal. Phil chuckles in your ear. He’s not here.

    “Prove it!” you yell. You’re startled to feel tears in your eyes, though of fear or anger or despair you can’t tell. “P-please...”

    “How?”

    “...” How, indeed? What can she do to prove it to you? What would she even be proving? Whatever she might do, you’d still harbor a secret seed of doubt, wouldn’t you? “... I don’t know. I’m sorry; I-” You don’t know what you’re apologizing for. You don’t know what to do. You don’t even know why exactly you’re crying.

    “It’s okay,” she says. Gently places her free hand on your shoulder. The one that isn’t missing a slice, thankfully. “I’ll have plenty of time to convince you once we’ve cut all the strings.”

    Your vision lurches. The sin rises. You know. It would be difficult. But you could. You can. You should-

Golden tendrils wrap around you; the sin recedes somewhat. “It connects Him to His Mind embedded in the planet’s core! To His sacrifice that still restrains the darkness to this day! Through this channel, God makes his will manifest through us - through humanity and His chosen Angels. But more than that; it ties Him to this world and to those of us who defend it.”

    A breath. He points at you with the sword. “Should we be proven incapable of defending our Lord - should we be overwhelmed by darkness - He will bathe the world in light and make it anew. We as His creations will be abandoned. Not through hatred, but due to simple inability. If this crystal is destroyed, then so too is the world we all know.”

    “Freedom.”

    “Annihilation.”

    “Jess, please. We won’t have another chance. We’ll both be killed if we stop here. I <em>know</em> God won’t abandon us; I’ve <em>seen</em> it.”

    “Angel Goodall. ACCEPT YOUR DUTY! Strike down those corrupted few who would bring an end to everything!”

    Choose. CHOOSE!

    Behind you, there’s a screech of wrenching metal, then a splattering cry. Two heavy thumps. Hesitantly, you look back.

    The shade still stands. Portions of its body flicker or billow, bursting briefly into black smoke before struggling to reform. It has lost one of its blades along with the arm that held it, and the other drags along the ground. But at the base of the steps, the Angel Nicholas lies in a spreading pool of blood, impaled on his own starmetal glaive. Unconscious or dead; you can’t tell. But at this rate, even if he’s still alive, he won’t be for long.

    The shade takes a stumbling step onto the first of the stairs. “A battle well-fought,” it says. Softly, softly. Then, to you. Its silver eyes are almost hidden beneath the blood on its face. “The time is here. Destroy it.”

    Naoriel and the Emissary face each other. The shade slowly approaches. Tendrils of light from the Lordstone encircle your Body.

    <em>Scene 206</em>
    “... I’ll trust you.” Pushing aside the paranoia and dreams of betrayal, you do your best to believe that Naoriel is telling the truth. That somehow, as a stable hybrid of sorts, she might be attuned to both God and the corruption. That she learned from the shade since your capture. That... as your friend, she would never lie to you at such a critical juncture.

    And that’s that.

    The Emissary - leader of the Cathedra and potentially the most important man alive - is easily dispatched. How could it go otherwise? He’s a feeble old man without any combat training and you and Naoriel are Angels. All it takes is for you to duck out of the way of his first swing before Naoriel can whack the blade out of his hand. Another brief application of blunt force ends the fight and he joins the wounded Angel unconscious on the floor.

    The Lordstone looms before you. An obelisk of divine crystal, displaying the gently shifting sky somewhere far above. At least, it usually would. At the moment, it’s frozen. Though you still seem to be the only one who can notice.

    “I can’t see them,” Naoriel whispers. “Do it, Jess. Please, before anything else happens.”

    “... I don’t know how. Not right now; you have to tell me.”

    “What? But I don’t know-”

    “Just say what I have to do. It doesn’t need details; I just...” You can’t describe it, really. The sin won’t manifest from your thoughts alone.

    “...” One final pause. “Cut the strings.”

    You know. The sin rises. You can. You must. You will.

    An outstretched hand. Your fingertips touch the Lordstone. Smooth, warm... alive. Everything goes white.

    “...”

    You can feel everything.

    It’s overwhelming. Fear and pain and fury and hopelessness and desperation and triumph and - you can’t keep up. There’s too much; you miss a million sensations in the time it takes to process one. The city churns with emotion; if you move back a little and unfocus, it feels almost like one gigantic Mind.

    ... Wait.
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1314427404856459284 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1314427404856459284><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, December 5, 2024 10:05 PM">10:05 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Something perceives you. Something distant, something unbelievably massive, and something far beyond your ability to even see, let alone comprehend. But even so, you’re touching it. A piece of it. A piece of Him.

    The force of God’s attention is so blindingly bright that you can’t bear it. His Mental gaze burns you even through miles of bedrock. Just this tiny portion of Him simply <em>looking</em> at you is nearly enough to kill you. An instant more and you would have been burned to ash just like the Mindless darkness beasts you destroyed earlier today. But something breaks. A connection snaps. You’re flung back into your Body with only fleeting echoes of His presence.

    You fall away from the Lordstone, Naoriel narrowly catching you before you fall down the stairs. “-o okay? Jessamine?”

    “I...” You feel like your Mind has been boiled. There should be steam leaking out your ears. “Y-yeah. Did I - whoa.”

    The Lordstone is no longer frozen. The patterns upon its surface accelerate, already whirling so quickly it’s difficult to distinguish one star from another. The golden tendrils are gone, as is the massive string. And - as you look around the room - the other Angels’ strings are gone, too. For better or for worse, you’ve done it. You’ve cut everyone’s strings.

    “Can... you see that too?” you ask, gesturing to the spinning patterns on the Lordstone’s surface.

    “Yeah... Do you know what it means?”

    “...” <em>It connects Him to His Mind... it ties Him to this world.</em> Words the Emissary had said only minutes before. Your memories are nearly whited-out by a brilliant light; you can hardly remember anything after you touched the crystal. But... something about a Mind... “No. I... I don’t.”

    “It announces the age’s end,” the shade announces. “Puppets no more.”

    “Puppets no more...” you repeat. Nothing seems different yet, but at the same time... “What will change?”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1314427470757494834 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1314427470757494834><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, December 5, 2024 10:05 PM">10:05 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“In the course of time.” The shade seems to have regained a portion of its cohesion; its legs are mostly back in the proper shape. “But presently, it will be departing. And it suggests these two follow.”

    Immediately, it makes good on its word and turns to leave the building. “W-wait, what? Why?”

    Naoriel follows quickly behind. “Jess, think for a minute. What did we just do? And how are the Archangels going to respond to that when they get back, very soon?”

    “... I see your point.” You hurry to catch up with them, jogging out of the Lordstone Cathedral and leaving nothing but destruction in your wake. You don’t dare to check if Nicholas is still alive on the way out; you don’t want to know. You couldn’t help him either way.

    The chill air outside is distressingly normal. The Cathedra is quieter now, but you can still hear the sounds of battle in the near distance. The Center is in ruins. Many other buildings haven’t fared much better.

    You hurry along. No one stops you at the gate. There’s no one left to do so.

    No one stops you in the main street, though you do spot a line of constables in the mist. Someone seems to notice, but they don’t approach. You don’t blame them. Instead, you disappear into Nucarreo’s alleyways.

    Turn. Sprint. Turn. Pause. Run. Turn.

    It feels like you’re underwater. Just grasping occasional impressions from the surface world. Everything feels so normal here, when you know it isn’t. You might be the number one criminal in the city, now, and you’re in the company of a half-Angel and a shade.

    Time winds on. The sun rises and sets. You find yourself in a cave. Nothing seems real. You answer Naoriel’s occasional words without thinking about them. Some food appears. You don’t know what it is. It doesn’t matter. The shade vanishes somewhere. You don’t care.

    What have you done?

    The sin is gone. Somehow, you know it won’t come back. You don’t know how you cut the strings. You don’t know the true effects of your ultimate... betrayal. Huh.

    <em>Epilogue</em>
    “You really think this guy’s gonna tell us anything useful?” Etalyn asks, glancing briefly up at the sky in distaste before stepping back under the platform’s roof. “Assuming he’s there at all?”

    “Of course!” Yara answers without hesitation. “My dear, I saw him in a dream. The most trustworthy source of information!”

    “So you’ve got no idea.”

    “None at all! But that’s what makes the adventure an adventure, doesn’t it?”

    “S’pose so.” Bells ring as their train approaches, slowing to a stop. “Damn sun,” she grumbles as they wait for passengers to disembark. “How’s it so hot already? It’s <em>March.”</em>

    Yara only chunkles; they both know how. The mist is gone; it vanished overnight only a week after the Cathedra was invaded. Only hours after the Lordstone itself dissolved into flakes of ash. The weather has been much more intense ever since, with the sun hotter, the storms stronger, and the chill of winter fiercer. Priests urge the populace to remain calm, but as Angels, these two are well aware that the Cathedra has no idea what will happen next. At least the corruption has been fairly quiet in the meantime, with attacks few and small.

    Optimistic Angels believe that enough shades were destroyed in the assault to throw the darkness into disarray. Pessimistic Angels believe it’s merely biding its time, preparing something truly devastating.

    “No Ascensions this Calling Day either,” Yara notes quietly as he peruses the newspaper he picked up in the station. “That’s four ceremonies and five months of silence.”

    “Wonder when they’re gonna stop trying,” Etalyn muses. “If nothin’s happened by now when we’re down fifty-some Angels, it just ain’t gonna happen.”

    “... Perhaps.”

    “You think He’s gonna come back?”

    Yara sighs, leaning towards Etalyn (or perhaps just away from the sun). “Admittedly, no. I don’t. But if we just admit that we’ll never again have any new Angels... Hum. It feels like giving up, perhaps.”
    ​</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1314775651475263499 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1314775651475263499><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, December 6, 2024 9:09 PM">9:09 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Just means we’ve gotta take the fight to the corruption before we run out.”

    A faint smile. “Still no progress on your assault plan, then?”

    She grumbles in frustration. “They’re all just so timid! We’re not gonna get anything done just sitting here and waiting!”

    “Now that, I agree with.”

    A lull in the conversation as the train rattles past a series of construction projects. There are a lot of those near the city center, these days. Even though the big attack on the wall had been a mostly-fake distraction - enhanced in severity by corrupted guards responsible for sounding the alarms - several other attacks had legitimately occurred to draw attention away from the Cathedra. Mindless darkness rose from hidden caverns much like the cistern discovered last March, requiring Angels to dispatch. There had been a lot of damage.

    “So, tell me again ‘bout your dream? And the guy we’re gonna be findin’, too.”

    “I’m afraid there’s not much to tell; it was dreadfully short. I was simply sitting in a market that I recognized from the sixth district, having my fortune told by a peculiarly-dressed oracle.”

    “They’re all peculiar,” Etalyn grumbles to the side.

    “Peculiar because he was dressed so normally, I should say. Anyway, instead of ordinary pictures on the cards, I first drew a portrait of Jessamine, then of Naoriel, then of their silver-eyed companion. At that point I grew suspicious that I was dreaming, and the oracle simply told me to find him. Then I awakened. And found you. And persuaded you to accompany me. And here we are!”

    “So it could’ve just been a normal dream?”

    “Definitely,” he says with conviction. “But we’ll never know unless we try.”

    “And if we do find a clue about them...?”

    “Our little secret,” he winks. “I’m afraid those at the top are perhaps a <em>little</em> bit too... absolutely furious to be trusted with information on the whereabouts of our dear missing friends.”

    “And you’re still calling them ‘friends?’ Even after they - y’know - did <em>all this?”</em>

But I fully believe that those two would never have purposefully brought harm to the city. They may have been deceived, or forced, or even been wholly unaware of the true consequences. Or perhaps we’re all being played for fools and one of them can turn the mist and Callings back on. We’ll never know until we find them, hm?”

    “S’long as you’re okay with me giving ‘em both a good whack for causin’ all this trouble.”

    “Oh, by all means! Never did I say I considered their situation blameless. Just perhaps more nuanced than a guillotine could determine.”

    After a few more minutes, the pair disembarks their train at the sixth district central station. As predicted, a number of market stalls fill the nearby square. Yara peers out at the crowd. “Quite popular today, it seems.”

    “Oracle. That your guy?” Etalyn asks, pointing to a flashy booth advertising “Fortune Telling! Most accurate readings this side of the planet!” The oracle himself, contrasting with the booth, looks very normal. Average height, maybe a little pudgy. Sandy hair and a tan vest over a collared shirt and dark brown trousers. Like a banker might wear.

    “Ooh hoo!” Yara immediately sets off down the steps. “Exactly as predicted! You see? Never doubt the dreams.”

    But Etalyn catches his arm before he can get away. “Hold on. Just be a little careful, okay? If that dream was real, then someone’s got some powerful magic. Maybe this guy, maybe someone else. But the last time you got a dream like that was from a shade, so just, y’know. Eyes open.”

    “Wide and unblinking,” he agrees. “Now, let’s check this intriguing fellow out, shall we?”

    “Yep. Let’s go get ‘im.”

    The oracle looks up as the two disguised Angels approach, shuffling a deck of ornately-designed cards. “Ah, a lovely young man and a lovely young lady; shall I perform a compatibility reading for you?”

    “My, oh my! How wonderful. Well then, how <em>can</em> I help you today?”

    “I saw this stall in a dream,” he says straightforwardly. “Dear oracle-”

    “You may call me Phil, if you’d like.”

    “Our dear Phil, we are searching for two highly remarkable individuals. Dream-you suggested that real-you may hold some information. Do tell, how correct was he?”

    Phil laughs heartily. “My! I’ll certainly do my best to live up to these lofty expectations. Locating divinations aren’t my specialty, but you could certainly do much worse. If you’ll just say the name of one of these remarkable individuals, we can shuffle the deck and get started.”

    “Jessamine Goodall,” Yara declares without hesitation.

    “Jessamine-? <em>The</em> Jessamine Goodall?”

    “The one and only.”

    “What a curious pair you are. Very well; let us begin.” Phil shuffles the deck with rapid precision, then holds out his hands. “Please, choose your first card. And let’s see if we can’t track her down...”

    Hey, thanks for playing! This story’s dead protagonist tally ends up at a remarkable zero - or a half, if you count our dear Jessamine’s first death and revival? Not for lack of trying, it seems, particularly at the end. Ah well, I’m glad all the (important) Angels lived through the prologue and get to have more adventures in the sequel: <em>End of Nucarreo</em>. The title might change as I consider the plot in more detail, but that’s the working title I’m using for my outline draft at the moment.

    I rewrote this epilogue entirely after finishing the whole darn thing - it was 1500 words in the first draft. It was also a lot more passive, with the narrator telling you most of the same things, and I really didn’t like it. I’m much more satisfied with Yara and Ets (our favorite Angelic not-a-couple-but-now-definitely-a-couple) actually going out and doing something instead of some voice in the sky saying it. So the delay did help there.

    But what happened to Nicholas? Lewis Kin? Maeve Kamiya? Serri? Erich? Seth? ... Jessamine and Naoriel??? Well, I suppose you’ll have to wait till the sequel to find out! (Okay, I’ll give a one-sentence minimal-spoilers statement of what happened to the first character that someone asks about in <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention">#story_discussion</span> - Jess, Nao, and the shade excepted - so all of you raving fans of Father Turner better move quick to find out how he’s doing.)

    So, what’s next?
    Disappointingly (or not, depending on how you feel), it’s not going to be <em>Angels of Nucarreo 2: more Angels, more Nucarreo</em>. I’ve been working on this story for well over a year now and the document is so long that it sometimes crashes Google Docs when I open it on mobile. I need to write in a different universe for a while. We haven’t run out of votes or motivation yet, so it’ll be business as usual - I’ll put up some new prompts in a bit, we’ll vote, and then we’ll have a new story. Hooray!

    Thanks for sticking around and engaging with what’s probably been my favorite story to date. Let’s keep it up for a good while yet!
