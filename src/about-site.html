If and when I decide to add logins, I will ensure all user passwords are salted and hashed, and never stored or transmitted in plaintext. I use a firewall, heuristic connection-blocking, and strong passwords - among other things - to ensure it's as difficult as I can make it to hack into the server this site runs on. I stay up to date on known vulnerabilities and keep the system updated to mitigate them.</h5>

                            <li><a href="https://fontawesome.com">Font Awesome</a> - They make neat little text-image hybrids like the search icon, dropdown arrow, and the stuff in the footer. All through CSS stylesheets.</li>
                            <li><a href="https://google.com">Google</a> - You may have heard of these guys. Google is my domain registrar as well as providing a nice free group infrastructure for email lists. If you're curious, look up Google Domains and Google Groups.</li>
