If and when I decide to add logins, I will ensure all user passwords are salted and hashed, and never stored or transmitted in plaintext. I use a firewall, heuristic connection-blocking, and strong passwords - among other things - to ensure it's as difficult as I can make it to hack into the server this site runs on. I stay up to date on known vulnerabilities and keep the system updated to mitigate them.</h5>
